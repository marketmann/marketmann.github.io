            <p>If you do what most lazy writers do, you'll slap one together at the last minute, after you've written everything else.</p>

            <p>And this will&nbsp;<em>murder&nbsp;</em>your ad.</p>

            <p>Flip through the nearest magazine. Look at the ads. You'll see a few with headlines that seem clear enough. Some may even induce you to read the body copy.</p>

            <p>But most of them will just float right by your eyes, like seagulls on the horizon.</p>

            <p>Your headline is the single most important piece of copy you will write. Savvy copywriters often spend...</p>

            <p><strong>90% Of Their Time Crafting&nbsp;<em>Just&nbsp;</em>The Headline!</strong></p>

            <p>Why? Because your headline must do two jobs, and do them&nbsp;<em>quickly</em>. You have less than a full second of the reader's scattered attention. And your headline must:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Catch the full attention of your intended audience</strong>... and...</li>
                <li><strong>Bring them&nbsp;<em>into&nbsp;</em>the ad</strong>, as if you have reached out of the page and grabbed them by the lapels.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Imagine you're standing at the edge of a crowd rushing by. Say, at a train station.</p>

            <p>Everybody's late, distracted, irritated.</p>

            <p>And you want to sell them a book about building Web sites that actually earn money. Your prospects include owners of businesses trying to make it on the Web, geeks trying to build them, entrepreneurs always on the lookout for information just like you have, and dreamers who think they have a good idea to upload.</p>

            <p>So, there you are. And there's the crowd, rushing by, ignoring you. How you get the attention of the people you want to talk to?</p>

            <p>Easy. You just yell...&nbsp;</p>

                <h4><em>“Attention, WEB SITE OWNERS! Here's A Free Report That Will Show You How To Quadruple Profits Overnight!”&nbsp;</em></h4>
                <p>That sort of cuts to the quick, doesn't it?</p>
                <p>Anyone within earshot who needs that information will scurry over to you and grab their free report. If you can get them to sit down and talk, you can begin your sales pitch for your book. If not, they'll read all about it in the special report.</p>
                <p><strong>Trigger words are the&nbsp;next best thing&nbsp;to the sound of your own name</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>They are shorthand, and very direct, descriptions of the very thing you are interested in. If you're a rabid bowler, you'll perk up to the words “Hey, Bowlers!”</p>
                <p>If you're hot to find a new house, you'll respond to the trigger words “house hunting” and “real estate secrets your broker is hiding from you”.</p>
                <p>If your business is hemorrhaging money, you'll likely respond to the words “cash flow secrets”, “instant flood of new customers” and “Chapter Eleven”.</p>
                <p>If you suspect your spouse is cheating on you, you might respond to the words “divorce” and “how to screw your husband or wife out of custody”.</p>
                <p>Readers&nbsp;depend&nbsp;on headlines to cut through the clutter and nonsense... and alert them to the articles (and ads)&nbsp;they really want to focus on. The magazine they're reading has 268 pages of copy in it, and most of it is advertising with no bearing on their lives whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Their morning newspaper is full of horror, bad news, the sports pages, and damn, they moved Dear Abby again. (By the way, did you know the&nbsp;comics&nbsp;are the most-read part of the newspaper?)</p>
                <p>And when the mailman arrives, there's a fresh stack of bills, flyers and catalogs all screaming for attention.</p>

            <div class="truncated-copy m-dlt-collapsed__grid" style="height:auto">Well, if you're smart, you won't. Even though that is exactly what MOST advertisers do.
                <p><strong>Here's a little test:</strong>&nbsp;Have someone open a magazine - any magazine at all – and read&nbsp;aloud&nbsp;only the headlines of the first twelve ads he sees. Try to guess what product is being touted.</p>
                <p>Heck... try to guess what part of the business world they're in. You'll see car ads with headlines that talk about jet airliners... credit card company ads that talk about backpacking... and cellular phone manufacturers that talk about living in Paris.</p>
                <p>I just picked up recent copies of Maxim, the New Yorker, and Playboy. (Shows you where my interests lie.) Here's a full page ad showing a crumpled napkin with the word “coffee” scribbled on it, the word “50 cents” crossed out, and “$4.95” written under it. They're selling Johnny Walker scotch. No trace of a bottle or label to be found. If you can't read the 5-point line of copy at the bottom, you'd never figure out who paid for the ad.</p>
                <p>Here's a full-page photo of a guy asleep, lying sideways with a blanket and pillow. The headline is “It's true, you can sleep your way to the top.” Lots of empty</p>
                <p>space. In small copy at the bottom, you learn this is an ad for British Airways. Apparently they now offer flat beds in business class. Very clever way to NOT alert your potential customers.</p>
                <p>And here's a full page grainy outdoor shot, with a pony-tailed dude looking out over a darkening valley. Headline: “Let someone else climb the corporate ladder.” Care to guess what the product is?</p>
                <p>Chewing tobacco.</p>
                <p>One more. Back cover ad, the most expensive real estate in the magazine. Fuzzy, light-colored background you can't make out. Here's the copy: “Pate. Pillows. Are GEESE great or what?”</p>
                <p>I am not making this up. It's an ad for&nbsp;Hyatt hotels.
                    <br>These ads are not written by salesmen. And they are not written with the customerin mind.</p>
                <p>Nope. They are written to please other dumb-ass corporate copywriters and designers and - worst of all - the client. Most copywriters think if they get the client to like the ad, they've been successful.</p>
                <p>Horseshit. In fact, I've discovered that, frequently, it's the Kiss Of Death if the client likes the ad. I don't&nbsp;want&nbsp;the client to like the ad. I hope it even makes him a little&nbsp;uncomfortable. I'm not getting paid to stroke his ego. I'm out to...&nbsp;</p><br><br>

            <p>It's very simple. Here's a couple of examples: “If you've always dreamed of a super-effective diet that's so easy, it works automatically even when you&nbsp;<em>constantly cheat</em>... then this will be the most exciting letter you ever read.”</p>

            <p>“If you'd like to get a brand new Porsche 911, for&nbsp;<em>half&nbsp;</em>of what everyone else has to pay (legally)... then you're going to freak over what I have to share with you here.”</p>

            <p>It sounds straightforward enough, but it's pure&nbsp;<em>genius&nbsp;</em>in its simplicity: “My name is Dr. O'Malley, and I have just written a book that shows how you can instantly increase the intensity and duration of your orgasms. Here is what I've discovered...”</p>

                <p>But don't you dare do that until you have loaded your reader down with more excellent reasons to buy than he can fit into his thinking process.</p>

                <p>Mark Twain once said: “There are two reasons a man buys anything. The reason he can tell his wife... and the&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>reason.”</p>

                <p>Take that to heart. You must satisfy the reluctance in your customer's&nbsp;<em>soul</em>... in his</p>
                <p><em>heart</em>... in his&nbsp;<em>brain</em>... in his&nbsp;<em>bank account</em>...</p>

                <h4>And In The Minds Of His Friends, Lovers, Neighbors And Spouse.</h4>

                <p>Don't just tell him it's a bargain.&nbsp;<em>Show&nbsp;</em>him, in a way he can easily repeat to convince his wife.</p>

                <p>Don't mumble about excellent engineering. Give him the specs, in a memorable story that will leave his buddies breathless.</p>

                <p>Don't be vague about why you're in the business. Tell your story, in a way anyone can identify with.</p>

                <p>And&nbsp;<em>keep&nbsp;</em>telling your story... but always bring it back to your customer. Tell her why this purchase makes sense. Why it will help her get what she most desires. Why it's exactly what she's been waiting for her entire life.</p>

                <p>Do you honestly have inside information, or a hot tip, or a way to deliver a better deal than anyone else can get?</p>

                <p><em>Tell me about it.</em></p>

                <p>Do you have an uncle in the Mafia who, just before going off to San Quentin, revealed to you a perfectly legal way to lower your income tax by investing in Euro dollars?</p>

                <p>Or, has the taxman surprised you with a bill you can't pay, and that means you must sell your entire inventory of widgets at fire sale prices?</p>

                <p>Or, on a cold drizzling day last March, did a stranger come up to you on the golf course and reveal a simple adjustment to your swing that caused you to suddenly start launching 300-yard howitzer shots off every tee?</p>

                <p>Okay. That sounds good. But why should I believe you? Tell me. Is it because you're a respected oral surgeon in Des Moines, with a reputation like gold?</p>

                <p>Or, is your business well-known on the West Coast, with a 25-year track record of honesty and breaking new ground on exciting stuff?</p>

                <p>Or, are you just a regular Schmoe who stumbled onto a good thing, and decided to share your good fortune with a few lucky souls... but you insist on treating every</p>

                <p>customer the way you wish&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>were treated - and seldom are - by being outrageously generous and trusting and taking on&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the risk yourself?</p>

                <p>Okay. Starting to sound pretty tempting. But how can I be sure this will work as advertised?&nbsp;<em>Tell&nbsp;</em>me: “Here's a short list of satisfied customers, including the Los Angeles Chief of Police, the Duke of Buckingham, and six well-known businessmen in your home town.”</p>

                <p>Keep pouring it on. “Here's why so many professionals and savvy people already are customers.”</p>

                <p>“Here's why we've decided on this price, and why it's a great deal.” “Here's why you can feel confident you aren't risking a penny.”</p>
                <p>“Here's how fast you can expect to get exciting results, and here are examples of those results.”</p>

                <p>“Here's how to order, and here's when to expect your stuff to arrive.” Here's the story.</p>
                <p><em>Here's what it's all about.</em></p>

                <p><strong>One last thought:&nbsp;</strong>Always stay one step ahead of your reader. Remember... he&nbsp;<em>expects&nbsp;</em>you to exaggerate and brag and be fast and loose with the facts. That's what every other advertiser has done since the day he learned to read.</p>

                <p>So... don't lie. Be brutally honest. Just keep imaging your reader shaking his head, saying “Yeah, right.” And then immediately confront that thought: “I'll bet you think I'm pulling your leg, right? Hey, I thought this sounded `too good to be true', too. Here's what convinced me otherwise:”</p>

                <p>Never forget that he doesn't really want to believe you. He's been taken for a sucker countless times before. He's&nbsp;<em>never&nbsp;</em>really gotten a fair shake from an advertiser.</p>

                <p>So be the first businessman in his life to treat him... like&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>would like to be treated yourself. Be honest. Offer a good deal, with plenty of opportunity to change his mind. Make the deal legitimately “fool-proof'. And give him lots and lots of reasons to...</p><br><br>
