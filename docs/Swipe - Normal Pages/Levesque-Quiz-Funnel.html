                <div class="bio__text">
                    <p>The year was 2008, and I was working for AIG in China when the recession hit and I quit my job to
                        start my own business. I was <strong>terrified,</strong> but I knew I HAD to do it.</p>
                    <p>I grew up working class (my mom cut hair for a living), and after studying neuroscience at Brown
                        and then working on Wall Street... I <strong>thought</strong> I wanted a corporate life with a
                        nice salary and benefits. But something was missing. The dream of starting my own business just
                        wouldn’t let go...until I finally decided to make the leap.</p>
                    <p>I’m telling you this because if you’ve been putting this off, there’s <strong>no better time to
                            start</strong> (or grow) a business from your home working remotely, selling and marketing
                        digitally. I struggled at first to grow my business, until I experimented with a new type of
                        funnel (what would later become called a QUIZ Funnel) to ASK my market what they wanted and then
                        GIVE it to them...</p>

                        <p>But with everything happening in the world right now, I have no idea when that next training
                            is going to happen or if we're ever going to offer that in person training again.</p>
                        <p>Now, because I've never delivered this training in an online environment before, this
                            training is going to be taught live and the course kicks off on June 29th.</p>
                        <p>Everything is being recorded if you can’t attend a session and if you want to go back and

                        <p>Yes, you CAN! You saw from my story that this is something that was a big part of my business
                            for years. In fact, there's a huge opportunity and demand for this. I’ve charged anywhere
                            from $15,000-$50,000 upfront, $5,000 a month retainer, and then a 5% royalty on gross sales.

                        <p>Then, choose from one of the high-converting quiz funnel layouts and designs which you’d like
                            for us to customize with your images, your colors, your branding. We’ll then take all that

                            account.</p>
                        <p>We’ll set up your pre and post quiz pages, all the questions, and the branching logic. We’ll

                        <p>2 Reasons:</p>
                        <p>Reason #1: We want to showcase the power of BUCKET 2.0 and get FAST RESULTS...and the best
                            way to create all kinds of QUIZ Funnel examples in all different markets is to get my
                            absolute best training in your hands and have my team build your quiz for you...</p>
                        <p>Reason #2: Even though we are LOSING money up front on this crazy steal of a deal, the reason
                            I’m willing to do this is because I know from experience, when our users have a quiz that’s
                            working for their business...they remain a customer for life...</p>
                        <p>I know that if I do everything in my power to get your quiz BUILT and getting results...You
                            are going to remain a Bucket user for life because it’s paying for itself MANY times over.
                        </p>
                        <p>So that’s my goal, plain and simple.</p>
