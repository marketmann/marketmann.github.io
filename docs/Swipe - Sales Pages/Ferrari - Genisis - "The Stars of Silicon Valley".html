        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>Goldie Hawn looked gorgeous as ever, sprawled across the elegant couch, her eyes glued to the center of the room.</p>
        <p>To her left... Sergey Brin... the billionaire founder of Google also sat spellbound.</p>

            <p>The private mansion of one of Hollywood's most powerful men... an
                invite-only meeting of celebrities and billionaires... gathered together
                to hear a Nobel prize winning doctor's greatest discovery. A true
                "cure" for aging. Can the shocking confessions she made behind locked
                doors help you grow younger? Find out below.</p>
        </div>


        <p>Across the lavish living room, pop star Moby perched himself against the wall, taking careful notes.</p>
        <p>Next to him Dr. Joon Yun - one of the richest and most controversial
            medical doctors alive - could hardly contain his excitement.</p>

        <p>World-famous celebrities... Fortune 500 CEOs... Silicon Valley technology whizzes... the top scientists in the world...</p>
        <p>All packed into the luxurious living room of a Los Angeles mansion... </p>
        <p>The exclusive guests of one Hollywood’s most powerful men.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, it was a historic event.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it was also a private, invite-only affair... <em><u>with a million-dollar price tag.</u></em></p>
        <p>Because at the center of the room, a <strong>Nobel Prize winning scientist </strong>spoke freely,&nbsp; revealing the jaw-dropping details of her latest discovery...<strong></strong></p>
        <h3>The single most important cause of human aging...<br>
            and a <em><u>safe, clinically-validated</u></em> way to<br>
            PERMANENTLY ALTER THE AGING PROCESS</h3>
        <p>It’s true.</p>
        <p>Information I recently obtained from a confidential source in Hollywood confirms it.</p>
        <p>After a legendary career...</p>
        <p>Spanning nearly 50 years of innovation...</p>
        <p>This world-famous scientist was invited to this closed-door meeting to reveal her greatest discovery yet. </p>
        <p>The true root cause of human aging... </p>
        <p><strong>And a safe, painless way <em><u>anyone can reverse the process</u>.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Groundbreaking research proves it too.</p>
        <p>Astonished researchers from the University of Minnesota, the University of Utah,<em> <u>and</u></em> the Nobel Prize Committee have now validated her secret.</p>
        <p>The top doctor at the Harvard Medical School is on record saying this breakthrough is capable of a “<em>remarkable reversal of many of the signs and symptoms of aging</em>”</p>
        <p>And even Dr. Dean Ornish... </p>
        <p>...best-selling author, medical advisor to multiple Presidents, and
            the chairman of a a secretive Silicon Valley health initiative called
            GHAC... </p>
        <p>...gave this miracle his official stamp of approval.</p>
        <p>Now, many of the rich and famous - including the power players in
            the room that day - are paying extreme sums of money to look and feel
            better than ever by tapping into this technological fountain of youth. </p>
        <p>In fact...</p>
        <h3>Several of these “privileged few” slipped up in recent interviews
            and hinted they stay young because of the incredible science you’re
            about to discover </h3>
        <ul class="bullets" style="margin-top:30px;">
            <li><strong>Christie Brinkley</strong> recently made a confession in <strong><em>Forbes</em></strong> magazine that suggests this breakthrough is the cornerstone of the anti-aging strategy that landed her in the <strong><em>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition</em></strong><u> at age 63</u>.</li>
            <li>Late last year, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> - the CEO of Amazon who recently became the richest man in the world - admitted he planned to spend a <em>few million dollars</em> on this breakthrough.&nbsp; Within months, his transformation from middle-aged, skinny geek to strapping stud was so profound <u>it went viral on Twitter</u>.</li>
            <li>And a recent publication suggested this is the reason <strong>Will Smith</strong> and <strong>Halle Berry</strong> look almost exactly the same today (around age 50) as they did in their 20s.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The great news is...</p>
        <h3>You can now use this age-defying formula, too...<br>
            without the million-dollar price tag</h3>

        <div id="sidebar-right" class="mobileHide">

            <p>A newly discovered “peptide” molecule that can permanently halt… even
                reverse… the aging process? It’s true, and among California’s richest
                and most famous, it’s an absolute craze. Stunning celebs such as
                Christie Brinkley, Halle Barry, and Will Smith… Silicon Valley titans
                like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and PayPal founder Peter Thiel… There’s a
                reason they look like they’re growing younger. Care to join them?
                Today, you can.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Because although there wasn’t a single “regular” person invited to this off-limits meeting...</p>
        <p>...and although I’m sure the elites in the room that day prefer to keep the power of this secret to themselves... </p>
        <p><strong>Today, I’m going to show regular Americans like you a new way to use this anti-aging miracle to get similar results...</strong></p>
        <p>...at a price anyone can afford.</p>
        <p>Yet, just like the elite, with this secret, you too can enjoy what’s it like to <strong><em>move, look, and feel</em></strong> like you’re <u>at least</u> a decade younger than you really are.</p>
        <p>Imagine it:&nbsp; A research-proven way to harness the power of this secret super-science of the rich to... </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Erase 10 years of wrinkles and age spots from your face...</li>
            <li>Supercharge your physical stamina and energy levels from morning to night...</li>
            <li>Wipe aches and weakness from your hands, your back, your knees, and your shoulders...</li>
            <li>Make your brain work smarter and faster, like you’re in your 20s again...</li>
            <li>And help you live to 100, without illness, free from the pain and discomfort that destroy the Golden Years of so many.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s <em>that </em>powerful and it’s all because of this incredible youth-enhancing formula...</p>
        <h3>A “peptide” molecule capable of <u>slipping inside</u><br>
            every cell in your body...</h3>
        <h3>...and <em><u>genetically reprogramming each of them</u></em><br>
            back to a younger age</h3>
        <p>It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I’ll show it to you in a minute. </p>
        <p>What’s more, a year-long human trial recently published in September 2018 suggests <em>stunning</em> evidence that …</p>
        <h3>Any person with access to this secret can expect to feel up to 27 years younger... </h3>
        <p>It’s all thanks to this incredible molecule, which now promises to redefine the way we look and feel.</p>
        <p>In fact, a small group of regular Americans recently experienced its youth-enhancing powers for the first time.</p>
        <h3>Their results were <em>astonishing</em>...</h3>

            <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-testimonial02.jpg" class="right-pic" width="170" height="170">For example, take Nancy R. from San Clemente, CA, who said this:</p>
            <p><strong><em>“I have good results...</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>I'm 63 and recovering from cancer surgery. I am running

        <p>This is just a glimpse of the results you can enjoy once you discover how to reset the age of your cells <em><u>from the inside</u></em>.</p>

        <p>And even if you have rotten genes and everyone in your family got old before their time.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to join these lucky folks and try the <strong>bold, NEW</strong> way to grow older, don’t set this aside.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Turn off your cell phone, sit down, and enjoy the story below.</p>
        <p>You probably <em>think</em> you know all there is about getting older. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Seeing this peptide molecule in action will change your mind</u></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s get started by going back to the powerful people in the room
            that evening and the unbelievable anti-aging technology they received.</p>
        <p>A night so extraordinary...</p>
        <h3>Every person invited to the closed-door, private meeting agreed... this night would <em><u>go down in history</u></em></h3>
        <p>You see: the woman speaking at the center of that room was Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn.</p>
        <p>And in the world of anti-aging science, Dr. Blackburn is widely considered one of the field’s leading medical minds.</p>
        <p>A geneticist by training, Blackburn was educated at two of the
            world’s greatest institutions: a graduate of both Yale University and
            the University of Cambridge in England.</p>
        <p>After finishing school, the young doctor wasted no time forging her
            legacy, making a groundbreaking discovery that would eventually earn her
            <strong>The Nobel Prize</strong>. </p>

        <p>She had been out of school for <em>less than one year</em>, and <u>was 27 years old at the time</u>.</p>

        <div id="sidebar-right" class="mobileHide">
            <img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-drblackburn.jpg" width="300" height="259">
            <p>Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn... Nobel Prize winner... and on this
                particular night, special guest of some of the richest and most famous
                people on Earth. The anti-aging secret she shared is changing the way
                the stars stay young. Now, you can use it too.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This discovery - how our DNA <strong><em>unravels</em></strong> as we age - would form the foundation of four more decades of research...</p>
        <p>Earning her an astonishing 11 honorary degrees from universities worldwide...</p>
        <p>Prompting President George W. Bush to personally ask her to serve as his special advisor...</p>
        <p>And scoring her a spot on <strong>TIME Magazine’s </strong>list of the 100 most influential people on Earth.</p>
        <p>Now this is all well documented.&nbsp; What isn’t well known is this...</p>
        <p><strong>In 1978, Dr. Blackburn left Yale... and moved to <u>the Silicon Valley area</u>, where she has lived ever since...</strong></p>
        <p><strong>...shoulder-to-shoulder with many of the richest, most powerful people in the country.</strong></p>
        <p>So it should come as no surprise she found herself in that room that night, speaking to that elite group...</p>
        <p>Spilling fresh details on her greatest breakthrough of all... </p>

        <h3>How to reset the age of your body<br>
            using this incredible peptide molecule</h3>
        <p>When it comes to looking and feeling great again, the molecule Dr. Blackburn revealed that evening... </p>
        <p>...which you’re about to <u>see</u> first-hand... </p>
        <p><strong><em>...is the “holy grail.”</em></strong></p>
        <p>It flies smack in the face of everything we’ve ever heard about growing old. </p>
        <p>The key to aging well isn’t your heart, your brain, or your immune system.</p>
        <p>It’s not collagen... stem cells... or anything like that.</p>
        <p>It’s not your hormones.</p>
        <p>(And it’s definitely not the dangerous drugs Big Pharma pushes on us.)</p>
        <p>It’s this incredible molecule.&nbsp; And when you have it, all those other things return to a youthful state as well.</p>
        <p>Imagine it...</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Joints and muscles that feel great... and perform even better.</li>
            <li>So much stamina it’s easy to run laps around your grandkids... <em>and circles around your younger coworkers.</em></li>
            <li>Skin and hair so smooth, soft, and healthy you often get mistaken as 10 years younger than you actually are.</li>
            <li>Eyes like hawk.</li>
            <li>A sharper mind... a trimmer body... a brighter mood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so much more.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>That’s not all. </p>
        <p>This discovery is also linked to reduced risk of Alzheimer’s,
            cancer, diabetes, heart disease – and to a longer total lifespan.</p>
        <p>Which is probably why the richest people in America are now clamoring to “grow younger” with these cutting edge methods... </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Peter Thiel </strong>- the founder of PayPal - spent millions backing cellular anti-aging and now declares he plans on living to be 120 years old.</li>
            <li><strong>Norman Lear</strong> - the legendary TV producer behind shows such as the <em>All in the Family</em> and <em>The Jeffersons </em>-
                personally invited Dr. Blackburn to his home to learn her
                secrets.&nbsp; At age 95, Lear is determined to continue producing
                blockbuster shows for years to come.</li>
            <li><strong>One mega-rich CEO</strong> traveled to South America to
                undergo a controversial and illegal treatment to harness the power of
                Blackburn’s amazing molecule.&nbsp; By some accounts, she reversed 20
                years of aging with <strong>one treatment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Point blank: this molecule is the future. </p>
        <p>Wait until you see the amazing way it works.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>It makes its way inside your cells... <em><u>connects itself<br>
                </u></em>to your DNA... and then rewinds your genes to the condition they were in when you were young</h3>
        <p>It’s like hitting the pause button on the aging of your body... from the inside out.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In fact, research just out of the University of Alabama shows once
            this unbelievable molecule enters a cell, that cell becomes immortal.</p>
        <p>As lead researcher Dr. T. Tollefsbol boasted... <strong>“<em>We can make cells <u>live forever</u>.” </em></strong></p>
        <p>What’s most amazing is how safe, simple, and inexpensive it is.</p>
        <p>And how fast it goes to work to bring you more energy, better joints, a smarter brain and more.</p>
        <h3>Once reserved for the rich and powerful...<br>
            starting today... it could be yours</h3>
        <p>I’ll share the entire solution with you in a moment.</p>
        <p><strong>Including a special way you can put this youth-enhancing secret to work inside your cells <u>right away</u>.</strong></p>
        <p>Don’t expect to hear about it from your doctor or on TV.</p>
        <p>Your doctor is buried under too much Obamacare insurance paperwork to stay on the cusp...</p>
        <p>The Hollywood celebrities and Silicon Valley tech moguls who discovered this secret first practically <strong><em>swore an oath</em></strong> to keep it a secret. </p>
        <p>And you certainly won’t hear about it from mainstream sources. </p>
        <p>You and I both know <strong>Big Pharma </strong>controls the media
            and would never allow a story to see the light of day if it could help
            you feel so good and happy you never need one of their drugs again.</p>
        <h3>Only someone committed to finding an easy, practical way to defy
            aging would ruffle the feathers of the world’s most powerful people to
            find their secrets</h3>

        <p>That someone is me.</p>

        <p>Although it’s now my life’s mission, to be honest, I never set out to make a career out of this.</p>
        <p><strong><em>It was forced upon me</em></strong>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You see: I was raised by my single mother.&nbsp; My father died when
            I was young, so for most of my childhood, she was the only parent I
            had.</p>
        <p>She sacrificed a lot so I could grow up safe, healthy, and cared for.</p>
        <p>And it allowed me to go to college, and then on to a highly successful publishing career in New York City.</p>
        <p>With my career soaring, I began dreaming about spending more time with her again. </p>
        <p>Watching her play with her grandchilden. </p>
        <p>Enjoying the holidays with the rest of the family in the home where I grew up.</p>
        <p>Spending long weekends together with my Mom, two avid readers talking about the books we’d read.<strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>
        <p>It wasn’t long before the universe punched me straight to the gut.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Slowly, Mom started to fade...</p>
        <p>Like many older Americans, with each year her mind and her body failed her, and her quality of life went to the pits.</p>
        <p>Unable to care for herself.</p>
        <p>Dependent on others for small and mundane daily tasks.</p>
        <p>Mentally and physically, she faded.&nbsp; A shadow of her former self. </p>
        <p>All the money I had... everything I worked for... </p>
        <p><strong><em>It all seemed so hollow when I realized I was losing her
                    and there was nothing I could do. That we’d never share the good life
                    she’d worked hard to give me - and that I now had. </em></strong></p>
        <p>Every doctor told us the same story. </p>
        <p>This is the way it is when you get old. There’s nothing else to do. </p>
        <p>The truth was hard to swallow:</p>
        <h3>The Medical Establishment has added<br>
            years to our lives... yet for most...<br>
            those extra years are lived in agony</h3>
        <p><em>Is that a life worth living?</em></p>
        <p>I watched my mom die like that.&nbsp; A victim of her own
            longevity.&nbsp; And as much as I wanted to remember the strong,
            capable woman who raised me...</p>
        <p>...for the longest time, all I actually remembered was the <em>elderly, unhappy</em> woman she became.</p>
        <p>I thought I’d never heal from that wound.</p>
        <p>Then... once I finished mourning... <em>I had an epiphany</em>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>I could heal my wounds... by helping others avoid the same fate.</strong></p>
        <p>So I took my money and spearheaded an anti-aging research complex.
            It became my personal mission to help all Americans enjoy their Golden
            Years <strong><em>free from pain, fatigue, and disease</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>To restore their quality of life and add years to their lives.</p>
        <p><strong>Which is why I prepared this presentation for you... and why
                today only, I’m showing you exactly how you can get the greatest
                age-defying secret I’ve ever discovered... legally, ethically, and
                without breaking the bank.</strong></p>
        <p>To do that, I’d like to ask you to think back a few years...</p>
        <h3><em>Do you remember hearing about </em><br>
            <em>the “discovery of telomeres”?</em></h3>
        <p>In 2009 it was all over the news.&nbsp; The discovery of something called a “telomere.”</p>
        <p>To put it simply: inside your cells, you have these so-called telomeres. </p>
        <p>Each one is like a chain, made up of about 8,000 links.</p>
        <p>As you age, the chain loses links and gets shorter. </p>
        <p>When that happens you start looking and feeling older.</p>

        <p>Studies show this process of telomere shrinkage is closely linked to <strong><em><u>nearly every common age-related disease... even cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease...</u></em></strong></p>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/table.png" class="center-pic" width="747" height="556">
        <p>There’s no doubt about it now.&nbsp; Stopping your telomeres from
            getting shorter goes hand-in-hand with enjoying a life of health,
            happiness, and longevity. A fact now recognized by the Nobel Committee
            and our own National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>As the renowned Dr. Blackburn herself recently said...</p>

        <p><span class="highlighttext-quote"><strong><em>"We’ve found that the better your telomeres are protected, the less your chance of getting any of the big diseases."</em></strong></span></p>

        <p>Meanwhile, a recent study at the University of Utah found long telomeres are directly linked to living a long life...</p>
        <p>While people whose telomeres get significantly shorter are <em>TWICE</em> as likely to die!</p>
        <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have now confirmed people who
            get cancer have telomeres about 15 years “older and shorter” than
            those of healthy people...</p>
        <p>And the telomeres of people with dementia are about 10 years “older and shorter.”</p>
        <h3>Yet here’s the <u>problem</u><br>
            (and the really exciting part too)</h3>
        <p>Despite the hype in 2009, the problem with the discovery of
            telomeres was it didn’t give us a way to actually halt the effects of
            aging.</p>
        <p>Yes, we learned that the most likely people to live to 90 or beyond... <u>in good shape, getting around, and enjoying life</u>...</p>
        <p>...are the ones whose telomeres didn’t get significantly shorter.</p>
        <p><strong>But we still didn’t know <u>how to stop it from happening</u> (or better yet, how to make them long again).</strong></p>
        <p><em><u>That’s the exciting part.</u></em></p>
        <p>Because Dr. Blackburn has now cracked the code... an incredible way <strong>to <u>regrow</u> human telomeres and <em>literally rewind your body’s age <u>at the cellular level</u></em></strong><em>.</em></p>
        <h3>Her solution is an elusive molecule<br>
            called the “TRT Peptide”</h3>




        <p>Best-selling author Dr. Joseph Mercola proclaimed it stands to revolutionize the way people grow old, calling it...</p>
        <p style="margin-left:60px;"><strong><em>The most exciting and viable
                    possibility for extreme life extension... The kind of anti-aging
                    strategy that can actually allow you to regenerate and in effect “grow
                    younger.”</em></strong></p>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-trt-peptide.jpg" class="left-pic" style="margin-top:10px;" width="402" height="302">You see: the first thing the TRT molecule does inside your body is to make its way into each of your cells.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It then <u>attaches itself</u> to your DNA, where it can access your genetic code.</p>
        <p>What happens next is absolutely incredible.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>Do you remember how I said each of your telomeres is like a
                chain? And the more links you have in the chain, the “younger” you look
                and feel?&nbsp; </strong></p>
        <p>Well, check this out...</p>
        <p>After accessing your genetic code, the TRT Peptide then <em>reprograms it</em> back to the condition it was in when you were young.</p>
        <p>The cell then responds by <em><u>adding those chain-like links back to your telomere</u></em><u>s</u>.</p>
        <p>And then, picture this: with longer telomeres from head to toe, your
            entire body begins to reverse in age, back to its younger self... like
            you stepped into a time machine.</p>
        <p>Even more incredible: the TRT Peptide isn’t some foreign substance
            like a drug or a steroid.&nbsp; It’s safe and natural. In fact...</p>
        <h3>Your body produces it <u>naturally</u><em>...<br>
                and you now have a safe way to turn it back on</em></h3>
        <p>You see: the reason we start to feel old is because our bodies shut off the production of this molecule as we get older.</p>
        <p>No one knows why this happens.</p>
        <p>The great news is we don’t need to. </p>
        <p>Because we’ve uncovered a way to turn it back on, and <strong><u>the results are astonishing</u>. </strong></p>
        <p>The TRT Peptide is so unimaginably powerful I’m not talking about <em>slowing down</em> or even <em>freezing</em> the aging process...</p>
        <p><strong><em>But reversing it</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>Research shows that, on the average, people are seeing the
            anti-aging, telomere-extending equivalent of eight and a half extra
            years…for some folks as much as 20, 23, even 27 years!
        </p>
        <p>This is brand new research, published in September 2018. One of the very first human clinical trials of its kind. </p>
        <p>It’s so new, in fact, that we’re still trying to wrap our minds around the implications. </p>
        <p>Just to be clear – I’m not talking about drawing out the “end of
            life” death-spiral of aging, sickness, and disease over an additional 20
            years. </p>
        <p>Who wants that? </p>
        <p>This study proves possible adding another two decades of<em> healthy, vibrant independent living</em> may be within reach of the “average Joe” like you and me! </p>
        <p>A bold claim, I know. But this research isn't coming out of left field...</p>
        <p>Because when I first began my research into life extension in 2015, I
            came across a breathtaking study conducted by world-renowned Harvard
            researcher Dr. Ronald DePinho.</p>
        <p>Working with a group of lab mice, Dr. DePinho engineered a way to completely turn off the TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the mice got very old, very fast.</p>
        <p>Their fur turned grey. </p>
        <p>Their brains got smaller and slower. </p>
        <p>They lost their sense of smell. </p>
        <p>Their digestion became poor.</p>
        <p>Exactly what happens to humans as they get older and lose their TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>Then... Dr. DePinho <u>reactivated</u> the TRT Peptide inside each of these mice.</p>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-trt-mice.jpg" class="right-pic" width="412" height="266">What happened next sent shockwaves through the medical community.</p>
        <p><strong><em><u>They aged “backwards”</u></em></strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>All signs of old age... vanished.</p>
        <p>Their thinning, grey fur was revived... dark, full, and lustrous.</p>
        <p>Their shriveling, slow brains got smarter and faster.</p>
        <h3>Once their TRT Peptide was turned back on,<br>
            they grew so young they returned to<br>
            their physical primes... </h3>
        <p>They even started mating and building families again.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>In side-by-side comparisons, these mice were <u>completely indistinguishable</u> from young mice.</p>
        <p>Had they been humans, they would have been labeled as “elderly” and “senile.” <br>
            Yet with their natural production of TRT Peptide turned back on, they went back in time... </p>
        <p><em>...and stayed there.</em></p>
        <p>Maybe you’re thinking… “I’m not a lab rat.” </p>
        <p>Of course not.</p>
        <p>And everybody knows results in the lab aren’t the same thing as real world results.</p>
        <p>That’s why the recent human study I mentioned above is such a game-changer (more on that in a minute)…
        </p>
        <p>First, let me share with you what real people in the real world have experienced with TRT Peptide... </p>
        <h3>This is the first thing you’ll probably notice when you reactivate
            your natural production of the TRT Peptide... and begin repairing your
            telomeres for the first time in decades...</h3>
        <p><strong>Practically everyone over the age of 50 describes the rejuvenation they experience the same way: “<em>I</em> <em>feel better <u>overall</u>.”</em></strong></p>
        <p>It sounds vague... </p>
        <p><strong>Yet if you’re getting older, you know <u>EXACTLY</u> what they mean.</strong></p>
        <p>It’s that top-to-bottom, all-over feeling of being in your prime again... and not headed downhill fast.</p>
        <p>Of being healthy from head to toe, inside and out.</p>
        <p>Of having a body that works <em>wonderfully</em>... instead of struggling to “get by.”</p>
        <p>Just take a look at how people react after first regrowing their telomeres....</p>

        <h3>There’s now a safe and practical<br>
            way for you to do it... without risking a penny</h3>
        <p>You see: after I discovered the unbelievable powers of the TRT
            Peptide and the irrefutable science backing its effectiveness...</p>
        <p>I learned the only people with access to this youth-enhancing
            discovery have been elite athletes and the mega-millionaires of
            Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>I couldn’t accept that.&nbsp; So I set out to discover a way to bring this science to as many people as possible...</p>
        <p>Not just the <u>privileged few</u> who have the money and connections to get it.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It became the #1 focus of my team of anti-aging researchers.</p>
        <p>After analyzing the research on <em>thousands</em> of potential compounds...</p>
        <p>We identified about 40 that are proven to reactivate your body’s production of the TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>We could have easily gone to market with any of those.&nbsp; They’re quite powerful.</p>
        <p><strong><u>I felt that wasn’t good enough.</u></strong></p>
        <p>It would be a disservice to our customers to provide anything less than <u>the most powerful formula possible</u>. </p>

        <p>After taking this amazing nutrient for just six months, some of the
            subjects’ telomeres aged in reverse by as much as 20, 23 and 27 years! </p>
        <p>Imagine, six months from now, looking and feeling as much as 27 years younger than your actual age.</p>
        <p>The first glimmer of hope for Telos95 came from a study at Europe’s renowned <strong><em>Life Length Laboratories</em></strong>...</p>

        <p>The results were out of this world. Here’s what happened:</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the study, the researchers created two test groups.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>One that received Telos95... </p>
        <p>One that didn’t.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, at the end of the study... when the two groups were compared to one another...</p>
        <h3>The telomeres of the group that got Telos95<br>
            were <em><u>20% longer</u></em> than the telomeres of the group that got nothing</h3>
        <p>This was a staggering result.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the results of these two studies have shaken the research community to the core.</p>
        <p>By some estimates… </p>
        <h3>That’s like <em>rewinding</em> your age by up to 27 years... and then keeping it there... FOR GOOD!</h3>
        <p>It sounds impossible, but with Telos95, it’s fact.</p>
        <p>Of course, these results happened under strict lab conditions, so I can’t promise you’ll get a transformation this profound...</p>
        <p>Yet imagine what your life will be like if your results were even <u>half this good</u>.</p>
        <p>How much better you’d feel... </p>
        <p>How much healthier you’d be... </p>
        <p>How much more quality of life you’d have...</p>
        <p>Then tell me:</p>
        <h3><em>What would you give to look and feel that young again... and to stay that way <u>permanently</u>...<br>
                for the rest of your life?</em></h3>
        <p>Quite a lot, I’m sure.&nbsp; And believe me: it’d be worth every penny.</p>
        <p>Yet, how does paying ZERO sound?</p>
        <p>Keep reading and I’ll show you how - on this page only - you can get a two-month supply of <strong>Genesis, </strong><em><u>without paying today and with no risk or obligation whatsoever</u></em>.</p>
        <p>First, let me tell you a little bit more about what you can expect
            when you reactivate your body’s natural production of the TRT Peptide
            and <em>regrow</em> your telomeres with <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>
        <p>I already told you about the fast-acting benefits you’ll first experience with <strong>Genesis</strong>...</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Energy to get through the longest of days, without the afternoon crash</li>
            <li>Durable, healthy joints so smooth, you’ll swear they’re brand new</li>
            <li>The physical stamina to do the activities you love again, without paying for it the next day</li>
            <li>A razor-sharp mind that helps you get more done each day, so effortless, it’s like you’re on autopilot</li>
            <li>And because of these things, people will <strong>treat you differently again,</strong> like they did when you were young and strong</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may even find you’re getting deeper, more restful sleep and
            consistently enjoying a better mood and better sense of well-being.</p>
        <p>Of course, there’s evidence the <strong>Genesis</strong> formula helps people who suffer from poor sleep, but I think it goes deeper than that... </p>
        <p>My guess is people who take <strong>Genesis </strong>rest easy because they don’t worry about getting sick or handicapped any longer.</p>
        <p>And when the weight of all that worry gets lifted from their shoulders, they can sleep peacefully for the first time in years.</p>
        <p>I also wouldn’t be surprised if you trimmed up around your waist
            because your metabolism speeds up, and you’re more active each day.</p>
        <p>Yet there’s so much more.</p>
        <h3>Now that thousands of our early customers have been taking Genesis
            for months, we’ve got a good idea of the long-term benefits too</h3>
        <p><strong><em>And they’re spectacular.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Because after a month or two, most people are thrilled how repairing their cells <em><u>from the inside</u></em> makes them look fantastic <em><u>on the outside</u></em>. </p>
        <p>You’ll know it when it happens because...&nbsp; </p>
        <h3>Your skin comes to life again</h3>
        <p>You probably remember it well.&nbsp; Healthy, vitalized skin that felt good and looked great.</p>
        <p>Get ready, because those days are back.</p>
        <p>If your skin is wrinkled, dehydrated, and rough... </p>
        <p>Especially on your face, neck, and hands...</p>
        <p>And no amount of cream or lotion has brought it back to life...</p>
        <p>The “Total Cellular Transformation” you get with <strong>Genesis</strong> could be the solution you’ve been looking for.</p>
        <p>Stick with <strong>Genesis</strong> for the long-term... </p>
        <p><strong>And I guarantee you’ll notice the difference. </strong>&nbsp;You’ll
            look brighter, fresher, and younger... and friends and neighbors may
            even pull you aside to ask what you’re doing different.</p>
        <p>The research proves it.</p>
        <p>Longer telomeres don’t just safeguard your body against the age-related sickness...</p>
        <p>They don’t just give you more energy and mental clarity, and make your joints and muscles strong and capable again... </p>
        <p>They don’t just increase your chances of living into your 80s, 90s, or beyond <strong><em><u>in full health</u></em></strong>... </p>
        <p>When you have long telomeres, you look younger too!</p>
        <h3>A recent study published by the British Medical Journal confirms the longer your telomeres, the younger people judge you to be</h3>
        <p>This effect is so powerful, it applies to identical twins.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You see: when study participants were asked to compare<em> <u>identical twins</u>, </em>the twin with the longer telomeres was judged to be <strong>significantly younger</strong>...</p>
        <p><u>With fewer fine lines and wrinkles and a much healthier complexion.</u><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
        <p>Since identical twins have the exact same genes, the bottom line is simply this: </p>
        <p>People with long telomeres look significantly younger than people with short telomeres...</p>
        <p><em>...no matter what kind of genes they have</em>.</p>
        <p>If you remember, that’s because the way the TRT Peptide works is by <em><u>latching itself to your DNA</u></em> and <em><u>reprogramming your genes</u></em> to a younger state. </p>
        <p>And only <strong>Genesis</strong> was specifically designed to do it. </p>
        <p>Incredible right? </p>
        <p>Yet my team set out to create a SYNERGISTIC formula.&nbsp; Unrivaled and unmatched in its power to regrow your telomeres.</p>
        <p>So let me tell you more about what’s inside...</p>
        <h3>TRT Enhancing Supernutrient #2:</h3>
        <h4 style="margin-top:5px;">Cycloastragenol</h4>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img12.jpg" class="right-pic" width="400" height="250">It
            may look like tree bark but it’s actually a powerful supernutrient
            extracted from the roots of an odd Chinese plant called the Astragalus
            flower.</p>
        <p>And a groundbreaking paper published in the journal <em>Rejuvenation Research</em>
            revealed that despite its strange appearance, this next-generation
            supernutrient could be one of the most important anti-aging
            breakthroughs in recent memory.</p>
        <p>You see: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the
            researchers took two groups of people between the ages of 53 and 87. </p>
        <p>One group got nothing, a placebo.</p>
        <p>The other group got cycloastragenol.</p>
        <p>Remember how I said your telomeres are like a chain?</p>
        <p>Well, it’s a well-established fact that AGING is the process of the
            chain being reduced from 8,000 links to about 5,000 links.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>That’s it.&nbsp; Just 3,000 links separate a healthy and fit 20-year-old from an old and senile 90-year-old.</p>
        <p>Well, one year later, the researchers measured each group’s telomeres.</p>
        <p>As expected, in this study, the placebo group got older, weaker, and slower.</p>
        <p>Their telomeres lost about 290 links on average.</p>
        <p>That’s almost 10% of their life’s supply, gone in a year.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the cycloastragenol group actually <em>gained</em> an average of 530 links per person. </p>
        <p>Can you believe it? </p>
        <p>Further studies indicate it happens because cycloastragenol increases your body’s natural production of TRT Peptide by <strong><em><u>200% or more</u></em></strong></p>
        <p>We were so blown away by what we saw, several of my researchers
            suggested we create a formula that consisted of just this and nothing
            else.</p>
        <p>Yet when we evaluated the potential of combining cycloastragenol
            with Telos95, we knew we were onto something.&nbsp; A potent 1-2 punch
            that increases your body’s production of the TRT Peptide <u>in two different ways</u>.</p>
        <p>It’s really getting good now, isn’t it? Let’s keep going...</p>
        <h3>TRT Enhancing Supernutrient #3:</h3>
        <h4 style="margin-top:5px;">Alpha Lipoic Acid</h4>
        <p>A lot of people call it ALA. Maybe you’ve heard of it before. For
            good reason too.&nbsp; It’s one of the most powerful nutrients you can
            put in your body.</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>It helps support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol</li>
            <li>It protects your brain from age-related decline</li>
            <li>It’s a powerful antioxidant and can dramatically reduce inflammation</li>
            <li>It helps support healthy blood sugar levels</li>
            <li>It even helps your eyes, ears, and bones stay strong as you get older</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And only Genesis has a synergistic formula that combines ALA with Telos95 and cycloastragenol...</p>
        <p>Here’s why that’s really exciting: </p>
        <p><strong>Doctors at the Emory School of Medicine recently concluded ALA specifically targets and lengthens the telomeres in your heart!</strong></p>
        <p>So while your peers are huffing-and-puffing and worrying themselves sick because their hearts can’t keep up...</p>
        <p>You’ll rest easy knowing your heart is actually getting younger and more powerful each day thanks to <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>
        <p>That’s one... two... three different mechanisms <strong>Genesis </strong>uses to regrow your telomeres.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>There’s still one more...</p>
        <h3>TRT Enhancing Supernutrient #4:</h3>
        <h4 style="margin-top:5px;">Vitamin D3/K2</h4>
        <p>Even mainstream doctors have wised up to why you should take Vitamin D3. </p>
        <p>What your doctor almost certainly didn’t tell you is <strong>Vitamin D3 could harden your arteries...</strong></p>
        <p><em>Unless you combine it with Vitamin K2.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Genesis </strong>takes care of that.&nbsp; Yet infusing our
            formula with this potent double-shot of vitamins goes beyond the
            benefits of taking them alone.</p>
        <p>Because we now have evidence that adding Vitamin D3/K2 to <strong>Genesis</strong> further enhances the telomere-lengthening powers of our formula.</p>
        <p>In fact, <em>in two different studies </em>conducted at Harvard and the London School of Medicine...</p>
        <p>More than 4,400 people were tested...</p>
        <p>And this potent vitamin combo was directly responsible for adding a <em><u>minimum of five years</u></em> back to their telomeres.</p>
        <p>And the exact clinical dose is found inside every <strong>Genesis </strong>capsule.</p>
        <p><strong>If you act while the quantities I’ve set aside for this
                special promotion last, you can get a TWO month supply, and pay LATER
                only if it works for you.</strong></p>
        <p>That way, you can join the <strong>Genesis</strong> “early adopters” who are building a brand new kind of lifestyle...</p>
        <p>A bold, new way to live their lives...</p>
        <h3>A no-holds-barred adventure<br>
            through life... at any age</h3>
        <p>That’s the power of the TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>Because when your telomeres are getting longer and you’re growing young again, the old rules no longer apply to&nbsp; you.</p>
        <p>While your peers are <u>scared stiff</u> about the future, hoping to “dodge the bullet” for another year...</p>
        <p>You’ll look at your life... </p>
        <p><strong><u>And see endless opportunity.</u></strong></p>
        <p>Which is probably why <strong>New Scientist</strong> magazine recently hailed this breakthrough as...</p>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/quote-ns.jpg" class="center-pic" width="800" height="266">

        <p>While <strong>Yahoo! Beauty</strong> asked...</p>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/quote-yahoo.jpg" class="center-pic" width="800" height="266">
        <p>And why even <strong>Oprah</strong> called the ability to finally regrow your telomeres...</p>

        <h3>Because we’ve added a revolutionary new compound that <em><u>enhances and compliments</u></em> your new longer telomeres and puts Genesis in a league of its own</h3>
        <p><em>Would you believe me if I told you we discovered a way to make <strong>Genesis</strong> EVEN more potent by adding a second, game-changing development?&nbsp; </em></p>
        <p>You see: inside each of your cells you have tiny structures called “mitochondria.”</p>
        <p>They’re like little batteries that provide energy inside the cell.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, like all batteries, over time your mitochondria wear out.</p>
        <p>And you guessed it... </p>
        <p>According to a new study from researchers at the University of
            Massachusetts, there’s a DIRECT LINK between your mitochondria and the
            length of your telomeres...<strong></strong></p>
        <p>And when you <em>strengthen </em>the link between your mitochondria and your telomeres... </p>
        <p><strong>You create a <u>cellular alliance</u> that <em>works in tandem</em> to prevent aging inside your cells.</strong></p>
        <p><em>How do you create this alliance?</em></p>
        <p>Easy...</p>
        <h3>With a special trademarked form of a supernutrient<br>
            named <span style="color: #1e9198;">Ptero-Vate</span></h3>
        <p>It’s pronounced “TERO Vate” because the “P” is silent. It's a
            special form of nutrient called pterostilbene, related to resveratrol
            but <u>vastly more powerful</u>.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s now inside every capsule of Genesis.</strong></p>
        <p>Pterostilbene (pronounced tero-STILL-bean) is found in blueberries, grapes, almonds and a few other foods. </p>
        <p>But you’d be shocked down to your shoes if you knew the <em>amount</em> of these foods you have to eat to get the dose of pterostilbene known to add years to life. </p>
        <p>Are you ready? Here goes: You’d have to eat over 500 cartons of
            blueberries to ingest enough pterostilbene to experience its full
            powers.</p>
        <p>And although it’s hard to get, you <em>want</em> that clinical dose. . .</p>

        <p>Because pterostilbene is so potent, research conducted at the Buck
            Institute of Aging suggests it could make living past 100 – in
            tremendous health – a perfectly realistic goal for anyone who takes it.</p>

        <p>And <strong>Genesis</strong> gives you the full clinical dose.</p>

        <p>How can you lose? The answer is simple: You can’t. The ingredients
            in the Genesis formula are safe, natural and harmless. And you can get
            your money back – in full – any time within 90 days if it doesn’t work
            for you.

        <p>All you’ll need is one capsule per day. In the first day or two,
            you’ll notice the “Total Cellular Transformation” going on inside your
            body...</p>
        <p>Little by little, you’ll start to feel <strong>incredible.</strong></p>
        <p>Then... one morning not long from now... </p>
        <p>You’ll skip out of bed - <strong>yes, SKIP</strong> - and it’ll hit you...</p>
        <p>The little aches and pains...</p>
        <p>The dense brain fog...</p>
        <p>The feeling of wondering if you’ll have the energy to “make it” through another day... </p>
        <p>Even some of your most visible signs of aging...</p>
        <p>Have all vanished... <strong><em>as if you had some kind of magic wand</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>Then... the most important moment of all.</p>
        <p>That voice in the back of your mind...</p>
        <p>Anxious about an uncertain future, always worrying when the <u>other shoe will drop</u>...</p>
        <p>Yes... that voice will be gone too. </p>
        <p><strong>You’ll be FREE. </strong></p>
        <p>Because with <strong>Genesis</strong> you’ll <u>KNOW</u> your health is safe and protected.</p>
        <p>That, my friend, is a wonderful place to be.</p>
        <h3>These are the <u>NEW</u> rules of growing old... </h3>

        <p>That’s why I’ve taken all the risk and am giving you a chance to try <strong>Genesis</strong> without paying anything today.</p>
        <p>See and feel the transformation for yourself... or you pay nothing.</p>

        <p>Dreamed of a happy, vibrant, fulfilling twilight... </p>
        <p>Walking the streets of the world’s greatest cities...</p>
        <p>Dancing at your grandchildren’s weddings... </p>
        <p>Tumbling around the yard with your <em>great-</em>grandchildren... </p>

        <p><strong>PS - Still here? Great. Maybe you have a few questions.</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some of the most common ones our customers ask...</p>
        <h3>What kind of results can I expect from Genesis?</h3>
        <p>I like to place results possible with <strong>Genesis</strong> into three buckets.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>First, you’ll feel a lot better overall.&nbsp; More energy, fewer
            aches and pains, deeper sleep, clearer thoughts, less
            inflammation.&nbsp; Think back a decade or two... <em>that’s how you’ll feel again.</em></p>
        <p>Second is looking better.&nbsp; A brighter, healthier looking face
            and skin.&nbsp; Combine that with moving and feeling better... and
            you’ll be shocked how people suddenly stop treating you like you’re “<em>elderly</em>.”</p>
        <p>Finally, I’m confident taking <strong>Genesis</strong> will add years of functional, capable, <em>high-quality</em>
            time to your life.&nbsp; The combination of long telomeres and
            healthy mitochondria is, in my opinion, the secret to increasing your
            lifespan... <em>while</em>... feeling like someone half your age <strong>so you have a life worth living</strong>.</p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter if you’re in great shape or terrible shape, if you have great genes or rotten ones... <strong>Genesis</strong> <u>will</u> work for you. Guaranteed.</p>

        <h3>Is it possible for something this<br>
            powerful to be safe?<br>
            What are the side effects?</h3>
        <p>Point blank: there are no side effects with <strong>Genesis</strong>. It’s all-natural and pure... and contains only ingredients backed by current science.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>To ensure the highest safety and quality standards, <strong>Genesis</strong>
            is manufactured right here in the United States (NOT China or India,
            like many of the fly-by-night knock-offs trying to steal our formula). </p>
        <p>That means you can rest assured what you’re taking is fully
            compliant with GMP safety standards... with no soy and no artificial
            colors whatsoever. </p>

        <h3>How often do I have to take Genesis?<br>
            How big is each capsule?</h3>
        <p><strong>Genesis</strong> couldn’t be easier.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The capsules are about the size of the average daily multi-vitamin
            and you get the full benefits with just one capsule per day.</p>
        <p>That’s all it takes to get a CLINICAL DOSE of each of the potent, youth-enhancing nutrients.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Be wary of anyone trying to sell you “kitchen sink” formulas that
            contain too little of each ingredient to have any effect (or that
            require you to take multiple doses each day, which is a clever way to
            disguise how much you’ll really be paying to see results).</p>

        <p>This special risk-free offer is only available to the next 500 customers to respond today, <strong>on this page only</strong>.</p>
        <p>You also cannot find <strong>Genesis</strong> in stores. </p>
        <p>With all the buzz, you may find a cheap knockoff at your local vitamin shop. </p>
        <p>Yet remember, the synergistic formula you heard about today is <em><u>unique</u></em> to <strong>Genesis</strong>.&nbsp; It contains trademarked and patented compounds.</p>
        <p>You absolutely cannot find it anywhere else and quantities are
            extremely limited.&nbsp; Don’t delay if you’d like to give it a
            risk-free try. </p>

        <p>That’s why I’m letting you try <strong>Genesis</strong> without sending any money today.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>When you claim your two trial bottles of <strong>Genesis</strong> today, all I ask is you cover a small $9.95 for shipping.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You then have 30 days to see and feel the transformation.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You only pay LATER, and only once you've proved to yourself it works for you.&nbsp; <br>
            If you don’t like it, one call or email is all it takes.&nbsp; You won’t be charged.</p>
        <p>I take <strong>Genesis</strong> every day.&nbsp; I believe everyone over age 50 should as well.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You have absolutely no risk with this unique trial offer. It <u>will</u> work for you or you pay nothing. Go ahead and see for yourself.</p>
