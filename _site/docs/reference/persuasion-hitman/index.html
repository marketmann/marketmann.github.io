        <div>My business is up 113% just 34 days after doing one consulting day with Ian Stanley. Itâs so shocking that Iâm having trouble believing these stats.</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm not a stalker... just obsessed with lively minds doing interesting things.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So... while ânot stalkingâ him I got my hands on his new book, <em>Confessions of a Persuasion Hitman </em>and loved it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>His take on subjects such as lifetime value, using the same language your prospects use and âtelling the stories that scare you mostâ are particularly good... and he comes at the topic of persuasion as both a copywriter and a marketer which I really appreciate.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And his informal style, sense of humor and good summary (i.e. accentuation of the key points of each chapter) made it a terrific read and very usable.</div>

          <em>You donât get what you deserve in life, <br>
                you get what you believe you deserve.</em>
        
        
      </h3>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-size:0.8em;">â Ian âI Deserve Itâ Stanley</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="drop-cap-book">Thus says Ian Stanley. Wise words from an old soul, because there are a <em>lot </em>of copywriters and marketers in the world today. Most of them live paycheck to paycheck even though they work 18 hours a day. Theyâve learned the art of making <em>other people </em>millions of dollars with the written word, but fail to ever figure it out for themselves.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs pretty easy to take big risks and swing for the fences when itâs not your money on the line. But I have always felt that until a you risk your OWN money to test and scale your marketing... youâll never really become a master. Thereâs simply no risk.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Risking... and losing... your own money accelerates the learning curve to true success. It forces you to see the world as it <em>really </em>is and not hide behind weeks of researching your ideal avatar. Iâm not saying that research and knowing your avatar arenât important... they are... but I can guarantee you that the marketer who spends money to test his research and attract his ideal avatar will understand their wants, needs and desires far deeper than any paid copywriter ever will.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thereâs a reason Iâm saying all this. <em>Rare </em>is the copywriter who hones their chops grinding it out for a few years... and then takes all the hard-won experience to make themselves a millionaire. Fewer still have ever done it <em>by the time they were thirty.</em></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Ian Stanley has done both. With a laser-like focus thatâs practically unheard of in our âshiny objectâ culture of today, he managed to gain decades worth of in-the-trenches experience. He then used that experience to start, grow and SELL his own business. Hell, I know plenty of millionaire âguruâ marketers who would never be able to sell their business, even if they wanted to.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâll admit... thereâs a lot to hate about Ian. Heâs young. Damn young. And yet he knows how to sell at a level that few professional marketers will ever achieve. And then there is the fact that he only works a few hours a day. I guess he missed Perry Marshallâs âMemo from the Head Officeâ about online marketing. The one that says âThou shalt work 18 hours per day, 365 days per year.â (If you know Perry Marshall <em>at all</em>, youâll get a laugh at that.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To top it all off, Ian is good looking... in a 1/2 British sort of way... AND heâs funny. Itâs enough to make me want to roundhouse kick him in the face. (And, since sensitive snowflakes have informed me that âwords ARE violenceâ... the next time you see Ian with a black eye youâll know that my words did that.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In all seriousness, Ian is wise beyond his years. His level of success and his deep understanding of the skills of persuasion are a testament to the power of focusing full out <em>on one single skill. </em>(Thereâs a lesson there, especially if youâre a broke marketer living paycheck to paycheck while trying to do everything yourself.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In <em>Confessions of a Persuasion Hitman </em>youâll be entertained, youâll laugh and youâll learn how to simply make more money. Itâs of particular note to recognize that this is Ianâs FIRST book. Follow him. Learn from him. And read everything he ever publishes. Because you only get better with time and experience and Ian is just getting started.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâre now in the enviable position to ride his coat tails as he grows, learns and evolves. And, youâll be able to make a substantial amount of money along the way. I wouldnât be surprised to see Ian transform the field of marketing in some big, evolutionary way... just like I did when I invented the Video Sales Letter <em>and </em>the worlds first Copywriting AI. #HumbleBrag #Twice</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I felt like I had a purpose in my life. That purpose was to kill bad people so that they couldnât kill good people.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I thought I was going to join Special Forces in the Army and then work my way into Delta Force - the most elite unit in the US Army.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, when I was 15 years old, I was mugged at knife point outside a train station in London. Those few moments shaped the rest of my life. (I wonât tell the full story now, but I will at the end of the book.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What people donât realize about a mugging like that, especially when youâre only 15 and your identity is being formed, is you are completely powerless. When someone uses violence or the threat of violence to get something from you, they are disregarding your humanity.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To them you are no longer a human being. Youâre simply a resource. Youâre just bones wrapped in meat and skin. Youâre an obstacle to what they want.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In those few moments, you are a slave to their commands. Your freedom is taken from you. Your humanity ripped out from under you. All for a cell phone and a bit of cash.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Experiences like that change you. A lot of people turn into victims. They accept themselves as prey. They become consumed by fear. They develop a sense of self-pity. The trauma is real and itâs ok to feel those things - but itâs up to you whether or not victimhood will define you moving forward.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I chose a different reality. I chose to become the type of person that would never become a victim. I refused to become prey.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The feeling I had after the mugging was the worst thing Iâd ever experienced. That lack of control over my own life made me sick. I never wanted to feel it again...and I didnât want anyone else to ever feel it either.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So I set out to become a âbad assâ as 15 year old Ian would put it. I wanted to become deadly. I wanted to become unkillable. Unfuckwithable.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Ultimately, I wanted control. I wanted to be able to control my safety so I could protect myself and those around me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I did Kung Fu. I did Ninjutsu. Then I stumbled across some old World War II combatives training. That led me to a man named Rory Miller who was a prison guard for 25 years. Heâd been in over 300 hand to hand encounters.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Right from the beginning of my training I was clear that I only cared about what WORKED. I wasnât interested in fancy shit that looked cool. I wasnât interested in combat sports. I was interested in how to break other human-beings bodies so that they couldnât hurt anyone ever again.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I knew that the only way I was going to learn the realities of how to deal with violence was to learn from people whoâd actually been through it. Not from some McDojo asshole who only cared about spinning kicks and bullshit blocks that didnât mimic real violence. (The same goes for sales and persuasion. Learn from someone whoâs done it, not someone who specializes in books and theories.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That obsession took me to some interesting places. I learned some invaluable lessons. I learned about violence. But most importantly I learned about myself.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I felt like I was designed for violence. The mechanics of it came naturally to me. When other people freaked out, I got calm. Where others ran away, I stepped forward.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I felt like my purpose was to lead men into battle.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The Universe had other plans.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Six months after turning 21 I got a DUI. I had only had a couple of beers. I wasnât speeding. Wasnât swerving. I was barely over the limit. But none of that mattered.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It meant I had to put the military on hold. Then I later got diagnosed with Crohnâs Disease which meant the military was on hold - forever.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs an uncommon situation to feel like you know your lifeâs purpose at a young age and then not be able to pursue it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But I believe that everything happens for a reason. (Which Iâll elaborate on at the end of the book.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I took that obsession for control and turned it towards persuasion. I knew I was either going to work for the government or for myself. There was never an in between.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Young Ian thought he was going to be a hitman in the traditional sense. With that option gone, I decided to take a different path. One that didnât exist. One that Iâd have to forge on my own.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This became the path of the Persuasion Hitman. A gun for hire - not for killing - but for getting people to buy things.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>The idea of the Persuasion Hitman was born out of my desire to play by my own game with my own rules.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I started out as a copywriter. I wrote words that convinced people pull out their wallets and buy stuff. Yet as a copywriter you are put in a box - consciously or unconsciously. Once youâre labeled as a copywriter you are expected to do what a copywriter does and charge what a copywriter charges. Youâre also tainted by all those whoâve come before you, if a client has had a bad experience with a copywriter in the past, youâre automatically associated with them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I wasnât willing to accept that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It also wasnât a proper description of my skills. Copy was just my primary weapon of choice. It wasnât my profession.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At my core I was a salesman. A persuader. It didnât matter what medium I used, I got people to spend money on things that would improve their life. I used video, characters, writing, email, sales letters, phone calls, and anything else at my disposal to get sales.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So why limit myself to some preconceived idea of how Iâm supposed to describe myself ?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I decided to call myself a Persuasion Hitman. Is it a bit cheesy? Yes. Does it turn some people off ? Probably. But most importantly, does it accurately describe my skills? Yes.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So ,what does a Persuasion Hitman do? What does a Persuasion Hitman charge? Whatever I want. There is no box, no game, no set of rules. I get to create my own reality.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Over my career as a Persuasion Hitman Iâve sold over a hundred million dollars worth of products online. Iâve worked with newbie entrepreneurs and 8 figure companies. Iâve been a gun for hire and owned my own businesses. Iâve built information product companies and Iâve sold an Ecommerce company to the fastest growing start up in Canada.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Iâve had an unusual life. Because of that, Iâve learned some unusual rules.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Those are the rules I want to share with you in this book. There are 13 in total. Yes, thatâs an âunluckyâ number, but I donât believe in bad luck. I make my own luck.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Warning: This book swings from intense and heavy (like the intro you just read) to lighthearted and funny (depending on your sense of humor.) Itâs a bit of rollercoaster and I wouldnât have it any other way. Some of lessons are story- based. They tend to be more entertaining. Some of the lessons are just straight up actionable info. Slightly less entertaining but just as powerful.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve done my best to make this something you donât want to put down. You can rip through it in a day and then reread it again tomorrow. Iâve found that I learn the most when I read one book ten times instead of reading ten different books one time each. I hope this becomes one of those books you read again and again.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One note on sales and persuasion before we begin:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Each of us is a salesperson. Weâre all selling all the time in some fashion. Sometimes itâs a traditional sale with an exchange of money for goods or services. Sometimes itâs selling your significant other an idea - like watching Game of Thrones instead of the Kardashians. And sometimes itâs selling yourself on something you know you need to do - like going to the gym when you donât feel like it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At the heart of selling is persuasion.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now I wanna be the first one to say it - persuasion is a dirty word to some people. It can conjure up images of slimy used car salesman with slicked back hair and tacky suits. Itâs the tool of serial killers and cult leaders. Itâs the foundation upon which tyrants like Hitler built their empires.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Yet persuasion is also the tool of the Good. Itâs how Martin Luther King Jr changed a country. Itâs what Churchill used to rally the Allied Nations against the oppression of the Nazis. Itâs a power you can wield to convince yourself to do the things that matter most in your life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Persuasion itself is not inherently good or bad. It simply exists. Itâs up to you how you use it. My hope is that youâll use it for the right reasons. And youâll be able to see when itâs being used against you for the wrong reasons.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm aware that the name Persuasion Hitman can create an air of criminality or darkness or an unethical vibe. I want to be clear that nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve never sold something I didnât believe in 100%. I think thatâs been one of my secrets to being great at what I do. Itâs a lot easier to sell incredible products that truly help people - especially if you use the product yourself. (But it doesnât matter how good the product is if you canât get anyone to buy it.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you sell shitty products or donât care about your customers, I believe that will come back to you in a bad way. Trust can take minutes, hours, days, or months to build. But it only takes one minute to lose it forever.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs not worth overstepping your morals to make money. It wonât work out long-term. Iâve seen plenty of people bring in massive cash windfalls, only to lose it all because they were unethical.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So whether youâre engaged in the act of selling for a living or not, understanding sales and persuasion is an invaluable skill that will serve you in any path you choose.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My goal with this book is to take you on an entertaining and useful journey through the rules Iâve learned in my lifetime from selling over $100,000,000 worth of stuff.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve used all sorts of methods youâve heard of - and plenty you havenât.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve done most of the stuff youâve thought of: Facebook ads, Instagram ads, Youtube ads, blog posts, email marketing, long form sales letters, funnels, etc.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Maybe more importantly, Iâve done some real weird shit that youâve probably never thought of: viral sales videos where I drink out of a toilet with a water filter. Parody videos of famous entrepreneurs. Changing the âfrom namesâ of email marketing to odd stuff like âYour Absâ or âYour Wallet.â Iâve even sold $10,000 workshop tickets by sending condoms in the mail.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve sold just about everything you could think of. $7 e-books, $70 water pitchers, $1,000 courses delivered via email, $2,000 solar generators, all the way up to $25,000/ year memberships in our LionHeart Pride Mastermind.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>None of this is meant to brag or sound self-important. Itâs to illustrate that I actually know what Iâm talking about. Iâm not one of those d-bags on the internet who read a few books about persuasion and then decided to write my own book.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My goal here isnât for you to model the chaos of my efforts. Itâs for you to understand the underlying principles and strategies that have allowed me to sell a whole bunch of stuff...without a whole lot of work.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most books about persuasion will teach you tactics and techniques. âHereâs how to run ads or write a headline.â I donât want to do that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Tactics and techniques only work in certain situations, and they rarely stand the test of time. They fade like writing in the sand.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Principles are timeless. Especially the principles of persuasion. Humans are still driven by the same core desires as we were 10,000 years ago. The trick is to tap into our primal nature to make selling an effortless act.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Persuasion is not a goal. True persuasion is the by-product of empathy and understanding.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A final Pre-Amble:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I swear. </strong>To hold back swearing would be inauthentic. I swear a lot less than I used to, but itâs still present in my speech. Iâm not willing to steal from you the experience of my truth by removing those words.</li>
            <li><strong>Iâm a guy. </strong>That means Iâm going to use primarily male pronouns for the sake of ease and conciseness, not because Iâm biased or sexist. It also means itâs likely that men will identify with me more. However, a shocking amount of women read and identify with my material too. As far as other genders are concerned, I hope it resonates with you too.</li>
            <li><strong>Iâm blunt and straight forward. </strong>Death is after us all. I may have the time for wasted words, false promises, bush beating, partial lies, and half-truths...but I donât have the energy for it. And I respect your time and energy too much to lie to you or waste your energy.</li>
            <li><strong>You may perceive me as arrogant at times.&nbsp;</strong>Now, this may just be own English shame...but certain things I say will likely seem arrogant or self- aggrandizing. That is not my intention. Any talk of my accomplishments or success is only written about if I believe it will serve you. That could be to show you whatâs possible, demonstrate a point, or tell a story to increase your recall. Emotion drives and encodes learning. Stories are inherently entertaining. That being said...I will also share my darkest and most embarrassing moment.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>How to read this book: </strong>(I know that may sound insane, I mean you just read one word and then the next, but I wanna make sure itâs crystal clear how itâs organized):</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This book is structured in the way that I think makes the most sense.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Each chapter title is one of the 13 rules. Clever, I know. I also came up with a little sub-title that describes the story or lesson the teaches the rule. At the point in the story or lesson where the rule appears, I highlight that rule in bold.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Interspersed throughout the chapters are little sections I call âmini-lessons.â They are directly related to the section youâll be reading, but instead of allowing them to interrupt the flow of the book, Iâve put them in their own fancy little gray boxes so you can read them whenever it makes the most sense to you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now that all the intense shit is out of the way, letâs get started.</div>

      </h3>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I started my career as a salesman a little younger than most.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I was three years old. Itâs a story my mum loves to tell me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Apparently hereâs how it went:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My mum: âIan, go clean your room and Iâll give you candy.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Little (bastard) Ian: âGive me candy and THEN Iâll clean my room.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This didnât make my mum particularly happy. Her plan was to use that trick for at least a couple more years.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But little Ian wasnât about that life. This experience (somehow) taught me one the simplest and most important rules of sales.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          Rule #1: Set clear boundaries.
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Start off right away by defining:</div>
        <ul>
            <li list-style="circle">What you will and wonât do for a sale.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">What you will and wonât do once the sale is complete.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">What your expectations are and how youâll meet them.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">What their expectations are and how youâll meet them.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>What Iâm known for in the world of copywriting is how much I make from such a small amount of work. It wasnât until recently that I realized that had less to do with my skill... and a lot more to do with my boundaries.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm crystal clear about what I will do and more importantly...will NOT do. I have friends who are just as good as I am at writing, but they work literally ten times more than I do and tend to make less money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Clearly defined boundaries are my secret weapon. Theyâre what allow me to work as little or as much as I want. Theyâre what allow me to make a living AND have a life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Violate your boundaries at your own risk.</div>

        <div>When I was about 10 years old, I learned something about sales that most grown adults have never learned.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>As a kid itâs pretty common to decide youâre going to have a lemonade stand. I had run multiple stands in the past with some moderate success.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But little did I know, this day would shape the rest of my life. (Which is something Iâve only recently realized.)</div>

        <div>Behind my house was a large tumultuous ravine. On the other side of that ravine was a 6-foot tall fence. On the other side of that fence was a large lemon tree patch.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>Inside that lemon patch were two large Rottweilers.</div>

        <div>I, Ian Stanley, craver of adrenaline, volunteered to get the lemons while my buddy DJ sat and watched. I climbed the fence and sprinted into the patch. I knocked lemons off the trees and stuffed them into my shirt as fast I could.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Then I heard the dogs. That was my signal. I sprinted towards the fence and launched the little yellow grenades over the fence. Then climbed as fast as I could while I watched the dogs close in on my ankles. They didnât get me.</div>

        <div>After we made the lemonade, we enlisted my grandmother to make her famous cookies. Now, I know everyone says their grandma makes good cookies. Most of them are lying. Iâm not. Grandma Ginnie was a straight up cookie gangster. Her iced peanut butter cookies were legendary.</div>

        <div>See, I lived near a golf course. And around dusk I would go onto the golf course and comb the bushes for lost golf balls. Iâd walk around the edges of the water and pick up balls that old rich white dudes were too lazy to find for themselves.</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Lemonade: $1 for the first cup. 50 cents for the second cup. Gotta incentivize them to spend more.</div>

        </div>
        <div>So letâs break this all down into some nice, digestible lessons. Then Iâll tell you the big mistakes I made that left a whole bunch of money on the table.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 1: Keep COGS as low as possible without skimping on quality. </strong>(Aka steal fresh lemons.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 2: Only do what youâre great at. </strong>Iâm a salesman and adrenaline junky. My job was to steal lemons and make it rain. Not bake cookies and mix the lemonade. (I still apply this today. When I write copy and make videos a lot of money gets made. If I start doing anything else the whole business suffers. So I spend as much time as possible doing ONLY âmoney tasks.â Specifically âMoney Laterâ and âMoney Nowâ if youâre familiar with my 3 types of money concept.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 3: Give them what they need. </strong>You canât play golf without golf balls.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 4: Location, location, location. </strong>You can do everything right in the wrong place and you wonât make a dime. I could have the best sales funnel in the world but if Iâm trying to advertise on MySpace in 2019 Iâm not gonna make much money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight"><strong>Lesson 5: Pricing and contract structure are the secrets to working less and making more. </strong>If you know your worth, you can charge premium prices. (Especially if like young Ian, you donât have emotional blocks around charging a lot.)</span></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 6: Always have an Upsell. Focus on increasing your AOV (Average Order Value). </strong>My lemonade and cookie pricing was all set up to extract the most amount of dollars from each customer. Offer discounts for people buying in bulk. Do everything in your power to incentivize buyers to buy as much as possible.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 7: Ethically prey on the insecurities of your potential customers. </strong>Ted knew he lost golf balls. I needed to bring that to his attention. Thereâs nothing unethical about making people aware of their shortcomings if your overall goal is to improve their life. Imagine how much it would suck for Ted to get to hole 16 with no golf balls. No one wants to be that guy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 8: Change the rules or change the game. </strong>Change the rules - All the other kids simply accepted that lemonade was 10 to 25 cents a cup. They were confined to the rules someone else had set. I changed the rules.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Change the game - Itâs called a lemonade stand. You sell lemonade. Thatâs the game. We added cookies and golf balls to the mix. Sometimes all it takes is some balls to change the game.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>(Note: This is how the idea of the Persuasion Hitman was born. As a copywriter you are put in a box - consciously or unconsciously. Once youâre labeled as a copywriter you are expected to do what a copywriter does and charge what a copywriter charges. Youâre also tainted by all those whoâve come before you, if a client has had a bad experience with a copywriter in the past youâre automatically associated with them. I wasnât willing to accept that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What does a Persuasion Hitman do? What does a Persuasion Hitman charge? Whatever I want. There is no box, no game, no set of rules. I get to create my own reality.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson 9: Learn from your mistakes. </strong>Looking back on this from my current perspective as someone whoâs sold over a hundred million dollars worth of stuff, I see some big mistakes we made.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Mistake #1: </strong>No cookie samples. I shouldâve broken up a few cookies into little bite-sized samples. When you have a superior product you should let people try before they buy. Iâll bet we wouldâve sold more if we had done that. (Except Iâm pretty sure we sold out of all the cookies anyways which leads to rule #2.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Mistake #2: </strong>Donât get high on your own supply. 10 year old was a chunky little fella who LOVED cookies. Pretty certain I ate a few of them myself.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Mistake #3: </strong>We didnât have a good sign. I actually donât even remember if we had a sign. I think we just had the table. My artistic skills were non-existent so I was never the âmake a pretty sign guy.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At the point in my life, Iâm aware that the sign didnât have to be pretty. It just had to say the right thing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The difference between a good sign and an average sign can be the difference between a successful business...and a non-existent business.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">When I was in college my best friend decided to try panhandling for an experiment. He was a short little black guy with long dreads. We threw a big beanie on him and some baggy clothes and sat him on a street corner in Santa Cruz, CA.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I made his sign for him. âObama ainât the only black man who wants change.â (This was during the Obama era where Change was the theme.) Each person who gave him money said âGreat sign man.â
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">A few years ago I read a story about a guy who made a million dollars in 100 days from his fruit stands. The biggest lever that took him from hundreds of dollars a day to over a thousand a day? The signs he used. He split tested all sorts of variations until he found his winner.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The winning sign was simple: âPicked Todayâ or âTodayâs Pickâ
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Words matter. Spoken or written. I can only dream about the profits we wouldâve raked in if we had the right sign.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Which leads me to...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lesson #10: Always celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small. </strong>As sales people we have a tendency to compare today to yesterday. Or today to tomorrow. Or worse, today to someone elseâs yesterday or tomorrow.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I remember the first time we sold over $10k in one day in my water filter business. I didnât celebrate or allow myself to feel good. Instead I said âIt couldâve been better. Iâve made more before.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But the reality was I had only made more than that in a day in other businesses. Ones I didnât own. It was a HUGE win. I shouldâve celebrated.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you shut down your emotions when you feel good, youâre going to stop seeking out the things that make you feel good. Itâs dangerous road to downplay your wins. Winning, no matter how small, tends to lead to more winning.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Celebrate your wins. Learn from your mistakes.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you canât change the game, change the rules. If you canât change the rules, change the game.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you canât do either, youâre in the wrong place.</div>

        </div>
        <div>The true difference between my lemonade stand and everyone elseâs wasnât my ingenuity or ability to sell. It was my ability to extract as many dollars as I possibly could from each purchase.</div>

        <div>I wouldâve had to sell 63 cups of lemonade to make $63. But by adding cookies and golf balls we were able to make $63 from selling 20-30 cups of lemonade.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In the world of real business (not that my lemonade stand wasnât legit), especially direct response where youâre tracking the ROI of every dollar you spend on ads, a high AOV is a game changer. Itâs the difference between an ad campaign dying after a few thousand dollars in ad spend...and scaling to spending thousands per day.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>For example, we used to sell a $7 ebook called The 4 Foot Farm. We got to the point where we were spending $15,000 to $20,000 a day on Google Display Network.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To break even on $15,000 a day in ad spend we would have to sell 2,143 of these $7 ebooks a day...which is a LOT.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Our conversion rate was good on the front end. But that wasnât the reason we were able to scale it up so high.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, right after someone bought the book they saw an offer (a one-click upsell) to get the physical version of the book shipped to them for $9. Then they got an offer to buy some seeds for their veggies for $27/mo. I think we also had a newsletter in there for $20/mo. And then finally... we had a $497 physical product that made it insanely easy to grow up to 100 punds of food in a 4 by 4 foot space. For the people who bought that, we had a $100 offer to get a lifetime warranty.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I couldnât believe it, but 2% of these people who bought a $7 ebook would buy the $497 product. And none of these people were angry about the upsells because they were HIGHLY congruent. A physical version of the book, seeds, and a faster, easier way to get their desired result. It was a smash hit.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The result of all this? Our $7 ebook had an AOV of $40-$44. That means we could spend up to $40 to acquire a customer. That also means we didnât have to sell 2,143 ebooks a day, we only had to sell 375 to break even. Thatâs how you scale an offer or a company.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We had a system for creating these high converting $7 front end offers. We had a template for our sales pages. Basically I just had to write a lead (the intro of a sales page) and some bullets. We already had all of our language for the close and offer dialed in, just had to fill in the blanks on that part.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So we used this formula to test as many different front end offers as we could.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I remember we had one ebook called â101 Energy Saving Secrets.â It did really well on the front end, similar conversions to the 4 Foot Farm. But we couldnât get our AOV high enough with our upsells to really scale the traffic.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The problem wasnât the front-end offer. It was that we couldnât find the right CONGRUENT upsells to get our AOV to the level we needed.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why you need to begin with the end in mind when youâre thinking about your offer. What else can you sell them? How else can you help them? What congruent upsells will convert well?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The 101 Energy Savings Secrets âfailureâ was an important lesson for me because it demonstrated how important AOV really is...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Which leads (damn near perfectly) to the overall rule of this chapter...</div>

        <div><strong>Rule #2: Do everything in your power to get the highest Average Order Value possible on every purchase.</strong>(Especially when youâre spending money on advertising.)</div>

        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: There are only 3 ways to truly grow a business. (Iâm not the creator of this concept by the way, but hereâs a description in my own words.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Increase your number of front end customers - </strong>This means bringing in more buyers. More buyers tends to mean more money. When it comes to getting front end customers it typically comes down to the OFFER. Find the thing the market really wants and then sell the shit out of it. Some products may be amazing but arenât right for front end acquisition. Donât fall in love with your products, fall in love with finding ways to help your customers...and get paid in the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase your average order value or customer transaction size</strong> - This means maximizing each purchase your customer makes. What could you offer them RIGHT AWAY that would improve their life, your product, their buying experience, and make you more money? Figure that out and youâll be primed to scale. You just got a masterclass in improving your AOV from 10 year old Ian. If I could give one wildly potent tip about improving AOV itâs this: focus on upselling products that are HIGHLY congruent. Products that ENHANCE your initial product, get them results FASTER, or offer a DONE FOR YOU or AUTOMATED solution.</li>
                <li> <strong>Get your customers to buy more stuff or buy more often - </strong>This is where the Lifetime Value (LTV) comes into play. You know who your best potential customers are? People whoâve already bought from you. Yet itâs incredible how many people forget this or ignore it. (I talk more about this in Rule #7.) If you have a list of customers, you need to foster that relationship and sell them more stuff they want and need. The people who ignore this tend to die painful business deaths. Thatâs why youâll hear the sharks on Shark Tank say âYou have a PRODUCT, not a business.â One product is not enough. Itâs a good place to start, but itâs not the end. And if you donât have other products? Find other people who have great products that your audience wants and sell them those.</li>

      </h3>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
        </div>
        <div>When I was 12 years old, my mum helped me make my first business card.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>She was supportive of my entrepreneurial dreams (despite telling me to âget a real jobâ or âbe an accountantâ countless times after I finished college). Support around you makes a big difference. It shapes how you feel about doing things on your own. It lets you know that it IS possible to make your own money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So what was this business card?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It said âStringinâ by Ian.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I started a tennis racket stringing business. The funny thing is I think we were trying to rhyme âstringingâ with âIan.â It doesnât even rhyme but thatâs ok.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We bought a used stringer from a friend for something like $400 or $500. We bought some reels of string...and my parents started pimping my business at the local club. (I never paid them back for the stringer. </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: If your parents forget to make you pay them back, donât remind them. Itâs all about the bottom line.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most stringers at racket clubs were charging $12 to $15 to string a racket. I started at $25. Again, I donât know why I was willing to charge more than everyone else, but I was. I was 12 years old with ZERO experience, so why not be the premium vendor?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The average stringer would finish a racket in about 30-40 minutes.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In the beginning it took me 45 minutes to an hour. But I quickly got to the point where I could string one in 16-20 minutes on average. (I got one done in 13 minutes but that was too much effort. I preferred to go a little slower and watch TV while I did it.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: As adults we tend forget that we sucked at EVERYTHING as a child when we first started. No matter how physically talented or smart...you were bad (at least to some degree) on your first try.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            As adults we tend to expect ourselves to excel at new things immediately. But we forget that you have to be bad in order to get good. Being bad for you may only last for 10 minutes or a day or a week. Or it may last for years.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The problem is we expect
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Realistically I was able to do 2 rackets per hour when you account for taking the racket off the stringer, measuring string, etc.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs $50 per hour at 12 years old. Not. Too. Shabby. I was getting paid more than the average adult per hour to weave some string and watch TV.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Looking back at this experience Iâm able to see that it was NOT a normal experience. I can also see that it has shaped my relationship to money in a profound way.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>All the other kids who wanted their own money were doing traditional jobs. Mow a lawn get paid $5 or $10. Get a paper route and work your ass off. Do your chores and weâll give you some allowance.</div>

            Whether it was a side hustle like reselling candy bars at school, or something more formal like stringing tennis rackets.

        <div>The entrepreneurial/sales spirit seems to start young. But that doesnât mean you canât develop now if that wasnât you...you have this book. No need to worry.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I learned at a young age that I could make more money than everyone around me in less time. All I had to do is get good at ONE thing and charge money for it. (This concept is something Iâll elaborate on at the end of the chapter.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most importantly I learned what I consider to be potentially the most important money lesson of all:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          <strong>Rule #3: Time and money are not related.</strong>
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, time and money have NO relationship in this world. We just think theyâre related.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I know some people will fight me on this so let me explain...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Society has conditioned us to associate time with money. We were conditioned to exchange time for money from a young age. Our first gigs as kids pay us hourly. One hour is worth X.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Then as we get older we get paid a salary. One year is worth X.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs even a common saying in our society: âTime = Money.â But itâs not true.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What further magnifies the problem is that we tend to learn skills that require us to be PRESENT to make money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This was the case with stringing rackets. I had to DO the work. The same thing happened when I was a tennis coach. Parents would pay me to hit with their kids in high school and Iâd charge $20 an hour. I had to be ON the court to get paid.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I coached tennis again after college and earned $70 to $100 an hour. Not bad for a 22 year old. All my friends were making $10 an hour to $50k a year. Here I was teaching tennis to rich housewives and kids making way more than all my buddies. Plus I made my own schedule and had freedom.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But when I looked around at the tennis pros who were 35 to 45 years old I saw that they were making the same money I was. I wasnât charging less than them because I was younger. In fact, I charged more than most coaches because I knew I was worth it. (Seeing a theme here?) There are tennis coaches whoâve been doing it for 40 years that still charge $40 an hour.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Making $70 to $100 an hour as a 22 year old is a monetary death sentence for most people. Itâs golden handcuffs.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thankfully I saw the glass ceiling. The older coaches werenât happy with their jobs. They were trading time for money. Plus, if it rained, you didnât get paid. If someone got injured, you didnât get paid. Or if hot housewife #3 drank too much wine the night before, you didnât get paid.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I was a slave with the illusion of freedom.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Somehow I was aware of that so I kept trying to make money online.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The problem was I was trying to do everything online.</div>
        <ul>
            <li list-style="circle">Write copy</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Build websites</li>
            <li list-style="circle">SEO</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Paid traffic</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Product creation</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Blah blah blah you get it.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Long story short, I wasnât making any money. And I noticed a pattern emerging amongst the people in the forums online.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>They were all trying to do everything too. And they were broke. (My guess is theyâre still broke.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So I decided to stop doing everything and just focus on one skill. (A concept I learned when I was 12 years old.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I chose writing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So every single day I woke up and hand copied a sales letter for an hour. I didnât miss a day.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One month later I got a job working with an internet marketer in the personal finance space.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We had an email list of over 1 million people and I wrote all the emails. I learned a TON. I was only making $20 an hour, but I knew I was developing a SKILL that would pay dividends later.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I used my money from tennis to live, and put ALL the money I earned from copywriting into a savings account. Six months later I quit teaching tennis and went full on into copy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I was only making $3500 to $5,000 a month but I was GROWING. Also, that was a LOT of money to me then.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now that skill that only paid $20 an hour when I started out, is worth $2,000 an hour in the rare cases where I do hourly consulting.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now when I work on a sales funnel for someone elseâs company I have some simple rules to ensure my payment is not based on my time commitment:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>I wonât start from scratch. The only way Iâll do it is if they have an existing funnel thatâs already getting sales. The amount of effort it takes to build a wheel is significantly more than it takes to takes to make an existing wheel spin faster.</li>
            <li>I ensure that my work is incentive driven. I will only play if it pays to win. Humans are incentive driven creatures, we like to be rewarded for doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I ask them this question: âDo you care how much work I put in, or do you care that I win?â If they say they just care that I win then I know I have the right type of client.</li>
            <li>I set clear boundaries of what Iâll do...but more importantly I make it clear what I WONâT do.</li>
            <li>I will only do the work if it pays a minimum of $25,000 up front. I do this for a couple reasons. One, the more I charge a client, the better a client they tend to be.<br>
                <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
                The two times Iâve discounted my up front fee are the only times Iâve had to deal with bad clients. Two, it keeps me from taking on too much outside work. The reality is I will make more money in the long-term from making my own funnels so I make sure not to get too tempted by quick cash injections from clients. (These days I very rarely do client work. It has to be a product and client that I love...and they have to be willing to pay a lot.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason Iâm telling you all this is because it comes down to that one simple rule:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Time and money are not related.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When youâre able to not just understand that concept, but apply it, you can experience exponential growth in your income and wealth.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You need to sever that relationship. Kick the time = money belief to the curb like a cheating spouse.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm not saying itâs easy. Itâs ENGRAINED in our society. But that doesnât make it true. And it doesnât make it useful.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>

        </div>
        <div>â$25k.â He said. âWhy not?â </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So I did it.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
        </div>
        <div>The client said yes.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #4: If the price youâre charging doesnât make you a little uncomfortable, youâre not charging enough.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thereâs an old Dan Kennedy quote that goes something like this:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âCharge as a high a price as you can while keeping a straight face.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I personally love in-person conversations. I still love a handshake and drink. I think the digital age is crippling our ability to communicate and connect.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>HOWEVER, this is one area where itâs an advantage. You can send an email or quote your price over the phone where they canât even tell if youâre keeping a straight face.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Get uncomfortable with your pricing. If youâve been charging the same price for a year then thatâs too long. As you improve you should increase the prices accordingly.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">
            <div>My Executive Coach Brent told me a really cool story awhile ago. He said he learned what price to charge from his grandmother.</div>
            <div class="br"><br style="">
            </div>
            <div>She had a simple rule: âWhatever you want to charge them, triple it.â</div>
            <div class="br"><br style="">
            </div>
            <div>Now you may be thinking this was just some crazy old bat who was babbling nonsense. If thatâs what youâre thinking... youâre wrong.</div>
            <div class="br"><br style="">
            </div>
            <div>This woman charged $80k just to do the interior design of someoneâs home. $80,000! I canât remember the exact number, but Brent said she charged something like $20k just to step in their home and THINK about doing the work!</div>
            <div class="br"><br style="">
            </div>
            <div>And to add some icing to the money cake, she did this in the 80âs, 90âs, and 2000âs. Thatâs a kingâs ransom these days.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I know itâs easy to say âjust charge more.â But that doesnât work. Iâm aware of that. You have to go a little deeper...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you donât believe you DESERVE that amount of money then you wonât be able to charge that much. Your self worth has to match up with your worth in the business world. If they donât match then you wonât be able to charge more, no matter how good you are or how much you deserve.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight"><strong>You donât get what you deserve in life, you get what you believe you deserve.</strong></span></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: This also applies to charging LOW prices. There are times where Iâve sold a product for $7-$17 that I know is worth literally 10x to 100x that or more. I know Iâm massively overdelivering in value, and it makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes you may actually be charging too little. But that discomfort feeling from charging a low-price can be valuable. It can be an indicator that youâve created an irresistible offer.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I have a product called the Welcome Email template that I sell for $7. The template is something Iâve developed over 5 years and countless tests. Millions in advertising were spent to test it and perfect it. Itâs the most important part of an email sequence. I could easily charge a lot more for it. But I know that if I can get someone to buy and USE that product, theyâre likely to buy a LOT more stuff from me. Iâve had people who found me from my $7 offer that end up attending my $10,000 email copy and deliverability workshop that I run.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Moral of the story: The âuncomfortable about the priceâ thing can swing both ways. It can make you uneasy to charge a lot. It can make you uneasy to charge a little. Either way, that discomfort can be a compass that youâre stumbling into fields of gold.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I want to teach you one of the most effective ways you can build desire in someone.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This works in marketing and other areas of your life. (Youâll see what I mean in a second.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm going to explain this in one of the best ways I know how: with an analogy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It IS slightly âinappropriateâ or ânaughtyâ but it truly is the best way for you to understand this concept so bear with me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thereâs a selling method out there called Results in Advance. Now I didnât come up with that phrase. (I think it was Frank Kern.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The idea is that you create results for your prospects BEFORE they buy. Itâs a good concept, however itâs not the reality of how you should think about selling.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, no one in the world has EVER sold a result. Theyâve never sold a product, widget, thing, service, etc.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People donât buy results, they buy the feeling that result, product, etc provides. They may not be aware of it, in fact theyâre almost never aware of it, but it is the reality behind whatâs driving their buying decision.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The only thing anyone has ever sold is a FEELING.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I want you to focus on Feelings In Advance instead of Results In Advance.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm not talking about some foof-y woo-woo description of âfeelings.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="ultra-important-excerpt">
            <div class="ultra-callout"><span class="ultra-tag">ULTRA</span> IMPORTANT</div>Iâm talking about feelings like joy, fear, passion, love, anger, pain, shame, and guilt. (These are the 8 core emotions.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <div class="mango-highlight">If you can create these Feelings in Advance then you allow your prospect to experience the feeling your product will create <strong>BEFORE</strong> they buy it. That feeling will get them to take action to buy.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But itâs not the full feeling buying will create. Itâs just a taste. (Think just the tip here. It feels good but you NEED more to feel fully satisfied.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #5: Youâre Always Selling a Feeling.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thereâs one primary focus of creating those feelings thatâs more important than anything else. Can you guess what it is?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs desire. You need to create an insatiable desire in your prospect.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>You can use fear, love, pain, joy, guilt or other emotions to create DESIRE.

            <div>During any sales message, presentation, call, or whatever else, you are doing one of two things:</div>
            <ol>

                    <div style="margin-top:6.8px"> Or... </div>
                </li>
                <li>Reducing a feeling (or feelings).</li>
            </ol>
            <div>You either turn up the fear, or you reduce the fear. You increase the pain, or you take it down a few notches.<br>
                <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
                Focus on the amplification or reduction or feelings and you have a potent strategy for building desire.

        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>Now hereâs a (slightly inappropriate) way to build desire<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight">You tell them <u>what youâre going to do <strong><em>TO</em></strong> them.</u></span> (Or in the case of selling something it can also be FOR them.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <strong>Think of it in the context of sexual desire.<br>
            </strong><br>
            The best way to create sexual desire is to tell someone what youâre going to do to them.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You whisper in her ear all the things sheâs going to experience. (FYI ladies: this works for dudes too.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Tell her exactly WHAT youâre going to do...but not HOW to do it. (See the âMr. Miyagi emails in my email copy course to fully understand this. Donât tell them how, just what.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âIâm going to toss you on the bed.â<br>
            âIâm going to kiss your downstairs.â<br>
            âIâm going to make you feel amazing.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            This is the PG version. Iâll let you imagine the R version...<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            When you create those images in her head sheâs going to feel as if itâs real. And more importantly sheâs going to want to create that feeling for REAL.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>

            â<u><strong>I want you to</strong></u> make me feel so good.â Itâs about HER. Itâs not about you.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Itâs the same in selling. Itâs about the PROSPECT. Itâs not about the sales person.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Think of what they want. Create that feeling in them. Tell them WHAT theyâll feel. Tell them WHAT to do. <u>But leave out the HOW.</u><strong><br>
            </strong>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Itâs a tricky line to tread. Iâve been lucky enough to figure out how to do it.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Notice that this way of creating desire doesnât piss someone off. It gets them excited. The only way to screw them over is to NOT give them an option to satisfy their desires. It would be wrong NOT to have a link or an option to buy what youâre selling.

        <div>If youâve ever read any of my sales pages, then youâve probably realized that I love to use stories to sell.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My favorite way to start any sales page, email, pitch, stage presentation, etc is to use a story.</div>

        <div>The more emotional that story is, the better.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now hereâs something weird I learned when I was speaking at a copywriting conference...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>There were about 50 people in a room who all paid around $12k to be there.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I was one of the speakers.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I decided to do something a little different than I had ever done before. I didnât know if it would work but I wanted to try it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>First off, I donât use slides when I speak. I donât have a powerpoint presentation. In fact, I donât have a script or anything like that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I write down my 5-7 points Iâm going to cover on a little piece of paper just a little bit before I go on stage. I base what Iâm going to talk about on how I feel.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So I went up in front of the crowd with my marker and a whiteboard. (This is my only prop.) I introduced myself briefly, then went into it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My presentation includes a drawing that tends to make people laugh. I donât want to ruin it for you but letâs just say itâs phallic in nature. Yet I donât acknowledge this AT ALL. I keep a straight face and simply talk about email marketing and how it relates to the picture.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In this case, the crowd laughs quite hard. I then tell them an important lesson.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini Lesson: Emotion drives learning.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            People are more likely to learn and remember your lessons and stories when they are FEELING something. That could be feeling joy from laughing. Pain from sadness. Anger. Whatever it is.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, one of the main things people want in this world is to FEEL things.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The world is full of people chasing experiences that will make them FEEL.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Think about it. Why do people go to concerts? To feel energy. (Most big pop artists.) To feel pain. (Country shows.) To unleash their rage. (Heavy metal.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>They go to stand up shows to feel good. To amplify their joy...or to forget about their pain and anger.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Ultimately, they want to feel CONNECTED. To the artist. The writer. The speaker. To themselves.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs your job to create those feelings and that sense of connection.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
       <div class="important-point-excerpt"><div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>Thatâs why I share so many stories. The stories arenât about YOU the salesperson, writer, speaker, whatever. The stories are about the listener.

        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Anyways, back to my phallic drawing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After the drawing I shared some super valuable content about copywriting. I told them some secret email marketing tricks I use like changing the âfrom name.â (All while jabbing them with little jokes.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I even told them about my weird thing I have where I cry during father-son movies. Specifically black father son movies. (I once cried on a plane during Men in Black 3. Itâs not even a sad movie...and itâs the worst of the Men in Black franchise. Weird, I know.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>All these lessons and stories ignited feelings of joy and passion. They were having a great time.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now it was time for the curveball.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I said âNow weâre going to shift gears. Iâm going to lead you through my meditation/visualization process called the Second Self.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I gave them a brief description of how the meditation worked and what they needed to know. The tone became quite serious.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Then I had them close their eyes and start some deep breathing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At this point I honestly had no idea how this would go. I had led plenty of groups through the Second Self ...but not directly after a âfunnyâ presentation.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I can typically get a feel for how âdeepâ the group is going because Iâve done it so many times. This one felt different. It felt even deeper than normal.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After the Second Self I asked if anyone wanted to share their experience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One guy hesitantly shot up his hand. He started his first sentence and then BOOM. He started crying. He had a profound realization. One that would change the course of his career (and therefore life). (Since his meditation heâs switched up his job and moved his family to a new town.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Then more and more people opened up. It was one of the most profound visualizations Iâve ever led.</div>

            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>I think a LARGE part of that has to do with the <span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight"><strong>emotional</strong> <strong>RANGE</strong></span> they experienced.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            See, most sales people focus on creating one core emotion in their potential buyers. (Consciously or unconsciously.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I used to do this too. One of the big emotions Iâve used a TON is fear. I sold a lot of survival products and water filters. <span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight">The primary way to sell those is to use fear.</span> You scare them enough about the future, the side effects of tap water, etc and they buy.<br>

            But letâs take a second to think about what might happen if you donât buy it.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Imagine you wake up six months from now. Your credit card debt has gone from $10,000 to $15,000. You get ready for work as you think about how much you hate your job and your boss. Your friends pick up your kids from school...and by the time you get home theyâve already gone to sleep. Yet another day where your kids will think you donât care about them.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You can take this as far as YOU are willing to take it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The point of this isnât to be mean. Itâs to demonstrate a point. Itâs to HELP the prospect become a buyer so that they can improve their life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>You can even say this after you paint the âpain picture.â</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âIâm not saying this to be harsh or cruel. Iâm saying it because I know that there is a cost to doing nothing. I donât want you to be in exact same place six months from now. I want a better life for you and I know you want that too. Otherwise you wouldnât have read this far, had this whole conversation, watched this whole video, etc.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You can âsoftenâ the pain a little bit by doing that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs also a way to connect. You acknowledge and understand their hesitation. You donât shame them for it. You simply make them aware of what they need to be aware of.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âI want you to imagine what itâll feel like to have this vacuum in your home. Youâre about to run some errands but before you leave you notice your husky puppyâs hair all over the carpet. So you take one second to push âstartâ on George. (Thatâs what youâve named your new best friend - the vacuum, not the dog.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You run your errands and return home to find a clean carpet with no hair. A feeling of relief washes over your body. All you had to do was press a button and BOOM, your house is clean.â

            Itâs Friday afternoon. Youâre having friends over that night. You have to go to the grocery store. Pick up the kids. Walk the dog. Cook the meal.

            But you donât have time to vacuum. You need to get moving. You leave the house saying âIâll do it before everyone arrives.â But thereâs a line at the grocery store and the stress keeps building. By the time you get home you donât have a minute to spare...never mind 20 minutes to vacuum the house.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Your friends see your disgusting carpet and decide they donât want to be your friends anymore. Your husband blames you for not having friends and decides to divorce you.

            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You die sad and alone...all because you werenât willing to put up a paltry $297 for the most advanced robot vacuum on the market.â

      </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When I was 22 years old I took a job selling DirecTV.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I worked for a company who was essentially a vendor for DirecTV. They got paid a commission for every house that would install a new dish with a 2 year contract. We (the salespeople) got paid a part of that commission.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I think we made about $125 per install. (Weâll talk about why the word âinstallâ is so important in a minute.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs how it worked...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>There were about 10 of us in the office each morning where we would do an hour of sales training.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After this hour (which Iâll describe soon) we each got sent out to our respective selling location for the day.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Our options were WalMart, Samâs Club, or Best Buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I started out selling under the wings of a beer drinking, cigarette smoking, beer bellied old man we called Timbo Slice. I think he was about 25 years old at the time. (Like I said, OLD.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Honestly, he was in his twenties but he was aging FAST. His favorite thing to do was go to TGI Fridayâs at lunch and drink 3-5 tall beers. (His theory was it was just the right amount to get you buzzed for the day but not enough to get you a DUI when you left at night. Canât argue with that logic.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Despite his habits, awful goatee, and dirt-biker sunglasses, he was a good dude that had a certain charm about him. This was his primary sales weapon.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Our first day was at Samâs Club. Samâs club is a discount store where you pay to be a member. (Think a cheaper version of Costco. If youâre not from America then just imagine the most outrageous MASSIVE store you can think of...then double the size. Then think even bigger bulk discounts. Want some toilet paper? Great, hereâs 50 rolls for $15. Not exaggerating.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In Samâs Club we had our table set up in the middle of an aisle where people would charge down either side of us with shopping carts the size of a European SUV.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Letâs just say the people werenât exactly in the mood to be stopped by Trailer Park Tim and a 16 year old looking boy named Ian Stanley. (They wouldnât let us have a beard and I look REALLY young when I donât have facial hair. Thankfully they would let me have a goatee so I grew one thinking it made me seem older and more trustworthy. It really just made me look more like skinny Kenny Powers.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But that didnât stop us. In Samâs Club the first step was Attention. Before we could build a relationship or sell anything we had to get them STOP and pay attention.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: <strong>Attention is the first step in any sales process.</strong><br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            If you donât have their attention, it doesnât matter how good your pitch is, how much they like you, or how amazing your offer is.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Tim had all sorts of lines he would try to used to get people to stop. Some of them good. Some of them the worst shit youâve ever heard. I really donât remember any of them but I wish I could.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I want to say the primary one we used was along the lines of âHey do like your current TV provider?â But I honestly donât even know if that was close.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I do remember that my primary strategy at the start was to ramp up my English accent and try to pull them in by whatever means necessary.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: Itâs better to be different than it is to be better. Itâs also a lot easier to be different than it is to be better.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you have something that separates you from everyone else then USE it as long as itâs ethical. Being English in America is an ethical advantage that I was morally ok with exploiting. (In case you donât know, Iâm half English and half American, which means everyone thinks Iâm Australian.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Americans tend to trust English people more. All of their animal facts have come from the English. (Thanks Dave Attenborough and Planet Earth for that.) Just so you know, English people arenât actually smarter, they just sound smarter. With the right English accent you can say things like 2+2=5 and Americans think âHmm, I think he has a point.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Step 1: Get their attention. Bonus: Qualify the prospect by trying to only talk to people who are NOT happy with their current TV provider.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Step 2: Find out about THEM. I think this is where I had an advantage from the beginning.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I understood a fundamental rule of sales that most people never seem to truly grasp:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: YOU donât matter (or what youâre selling doesnât matter) until you know what matters to THEM (your prospect).</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I would ask them important questions.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>What TV provider do you currently have?</li>
            <li>Do you like it?</li>
            <li>What is missing from it? Where are you NOT satisfied?</li>
            <li>This is where I would dig into figuring out their buying desires. Were they price driven? Quality driven? Did they want the best thing? The most expensive thing?</li>
        </ul>
        <div>See, most of the sales people were selling on price. We could typically get them a better deal at DirecTV than what they were using. But that wasnât always the case. In fact, if someone had a really good deal already and they liked what they had I would say âIt sounds like you have a great set up. You probably donât need this...unless....are you a football fan?â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>DirecTV had something called âNFL Sunday Ticket.â Basically you could watch every single football game every Sunday. AND you got the Red Zone channel which is basically just football teams scoring. It was an amazing package for football fans and we were the only ones who had it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: Sports fans are price insensitive. I know from experience. Iâm a die hard Liverpool fan. I buy $110 jerseys and I did far before I could afford it. I wouldnât spend more than $10 on a t-shirt but Iâd spend 11x that on a Liverpool jersey.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Same goes for legit fans of teams. Sports are SOOOOO emotional that their emotions override any logic. Hence people punching people in the face in the heat of the moment even though they are cheering for the same team.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Take a guy who makes $10 an hour at a retail store. Should he buy a $100 Lebron James jersey? No. Can he afford it? Probably not. But heâll buy it because he has a deep emotional bond with Lebron and his team.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So by the end of step 2 I knew what mattered to THEM.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now it was time for step 3:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Step 3: A custom offer. The benefit of selling face-to- face, over the phone, or one-on-one is that you get to customize the offer and benefits to the person youâre speaking to. When Iâm writing a sales letter that will be read by millions of people I donât have that luxury.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At this point I would basically just walk them through the different options they had. They varied in price and what channels they would get.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now for the main point of this whole part of the story. This is one of the single most important selling rules I ever learned...and I only recently realized I learned in because of this experience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Step 4: DO THE MATH. This is also the rule of this chapter...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          <strong>Rule #6: Always do the math.</strong>
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Anyone whoâs in The Unit (my paid membership group) or has read my teachings for any period of time has heard me harp on this fact over and over again. Why? Because itâs that important.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs why:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People donât like to do math so you have to do it FOR them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When youâre at the end of a pitch (or sometimes the beginning) you simply need to make SENSE. (Or CENTS. See what I did there? Did you see it?)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You need to logically lay out the mathematics of WHY they should buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We always started with the highest price option. Why? Because it set the price anchor as high. It also creates fear. When youâve already sold someone on your product (DirecTV in this case) but then you make it seem super expensive, you create some fear. They fear they wonât be able to afford it. Suddenly they think they canât have it....and boom...they want it even more.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs the cool part: Some people can afford the higher price. I wasnât paid based on the package they signed up for so I didnât care what package they chose. I just wanted to make sure they were happy. (Hint: thatâs cuz of this âinstallâ word I mentioned at the start of this story. Itâs HIGHLY important.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The rest of the people? They were relieved when I ran through the pricing of the cheaper options. Relief is a release of fear. (Remember, at all times you should be amplifying or reducing emotions. Here I amplified fear, then reduced it.) Itâs a great motivator for buying. Think of someone in a state of relief. Theyâre so happy that they donât care about trivial little things...they just want to buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now for the HOW of the math.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Each morning we would âdrillâ our sales techniques on whiteboards at the office.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Weâd role-play different types of customers with different types of objections. (Hint: A good sales training program is a lot like a good sex life. You try out new things, make some mistakes, get into some awkward situations, but everyoneâs satisfied in the end.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Then weâd drill the numbers. This was the primary focus of our training. We had extremely specific âprice ladders.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We had to reveal our pricing in the exact right sequence. Taking them from the top of the ladder to the bottom. The reason I call it a âprice ladderâ (a term I just made up) is because you donât jump straight to the top rung of the ladder. You show them the top rung, then let them climb to the bottom one rung at a time.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If I showed them the pricing in the wrong order, it wouldnât have worked. I knew our numbers and our competitorâs numbers by heart.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We drilled over and over again on the whiteboards in the office... then in âthe fieldâ we would use little laminated papers with columns. These columns gave a shape to offer. </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: The âcloseâ and âofferâ parts of a sales pitch, letter, email etc can be templatized.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Thereâs no reason to reinvent the wheel here. Iâve used the same âclose formulaâ for over 50 different sales letters. Once youâve gotten that far in the pitch, you should base your strategy off of whatâs worked in the past. No need to get super creative.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Itâs the opening and the meat of the pitch that need your creativity.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><u>Rule of math: </u>Whenever you âdo the mathâ start with the highest number that logically fits the argument.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs an example of something I said to someone who wanted me to write copy for them:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt"><em>âOne client used my copy to sell over $7.5 million worth of a solar generator. Itâs still making them money today.</em><br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <em>Now, I think youâd agree that $3.5 million in sales is worth paying me $100,000. But thatâs not what they paid. They paid me $50,000. $50,000 to make $7.5 million. Pretty good deal right?</em><br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <em>But Iâm not gonna be starting at $50k for you. Iâm starting at $25k up front. Imagine investing $25k with me today and ending up with over $7 million in sales from that tiny investment.â</em>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason I start with the $7.5 million is because it sets a price anchor in their mind. It doesnât matter if the company youâre speaking to is nowhere near that amount in sales. What matters is the number you said. Itâs involuntary for humans to compare prices in their mind. They canât help it. So start as high as you can WHILE making sense. It has to be REAL and BELIEVABLE. Not just some outlandish number you came up with out of nowhere.</div>

      </h3></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Over the past few years Iâve made more money per subscriber on my email list than anyone I know. (There could be people doing more than me, I just donât know them.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So let me tell you about this unusual statistic...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I recently decided to do some math.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâve never run these specific numbers before but one of my top rules for sales in general is do the math, so I guess it was overdue.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I wanted to know how much I earn per subscriber from my email list. My list is now around 6,000 people. (It was only 3,000 a couple months ago.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It earns around $70k to $130k per month.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That comes out to about $11 to $22 per subscriber per month.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The average for most lists is supposed to be about $1 per month per subscriber. So mine is about 11 to 22 times higher than most.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now let me be clear. This is NOT normal. Iâm not saying you can replicate that. (Iâm also not saying I do this high a number in other niches.) But even if you can get $2 per name per month youâre over double the norm.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason I think I have such a high earnings per subscriber (EPS) is because I focus on the long-game BUT understand the importance of cash flow in the short term.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, most successful email marketing folk fall into one of two categories.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pump and dump. Churn and burn. </strong>They want short term cash to fund their traffic costs. It can work well...but not in the long-term. Overall itâs a stressful business model. This is how a lot of 7-8 figure business owners I know operate.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-game only. </strong>This is more common amongst people who only teach marketing or people with high ticket items that donât spend money on paid traffic. They donât need short-term cash flow because they rely on referrals and high profit margins.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The real money comes to you when you understand both. Thatâs how you earn revenue from day zero but turn high profits over the long-term.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs the email system Iâve practiced in my business. I do this for ONE primary reason:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So you can scale your traffic.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you can acquire traffic at breakeven on Day 0 or even day 14 or day 30...you can scale in real and PROFITABLE way.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you can nail this short game/long game combo strategy that I apply, you can outspend your competitors and exponentially grow your biz.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Imagine this...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâre currently getting 1,000 new subscribers a day. You spend $1 to acquire each subscriber. They are worth $1 on day 14. You decide you can spend $1 to acquire each customer.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now what if you could get just $1.25 per subscriber on day 14. Now you decide you can spend $1.25 per subscriber.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs the cool part. Scaling traffic is NOT linear. Itâs exponential in a lot of cases. At the $1 per subscriber number you can only get 1,000 subscribers a day.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>$1.25 per subscriber is only a 25% lift in revenue. But when you start spending $1.25 per new subscriber you probably wonât only get an additional 25% in new customers.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You may start getting 2,000 new subscribers today. Now what if you could spend $2 per new subscriber?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You may suddenly start getting 5,000 new subscribers per day. Youâve only doubled your revenue per subscriber, but now youâre acquiring 5x the amount of subscribers.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now youâve just gone from $1k per day to $10k per day just by doubling your subscriber value.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm not saying that these are typical results. But Iâve seen it happen in businesses Iâve worked with once Iâve reworked the autoresponder.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, the reason this happens is because of something I call the âTraffic Cliff.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The âTraffic Cliffâ is the reason why Agora Financial (a two billion dollar per year direct response company) is so successful. Itâs the reason why one of my best friends has had his supplement company for ten years when most people fail after two.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The âTraffic Cliff â is the magical place you arrive at when you can outspend your competitors. Itâs the exponential growth curve.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If everyone else can only spend $2 per subscriber, but you can spend $2.50 youâre not gonna get 25% more subscribers than them. Youâll get 2x or 5x the subscribers because youâve just hit the cliff where they canât spend any more money... but you can.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Agora knows their numbers. They know they can spend more than anyone else. Thatâs why they did over $2 billion last year and most people are struggling to break 7 or 8 figures. Or scale from $20 million to $30 or $40 million...or to 9 figures. (Obviously there are other reasons, but this is the basis for their success.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Agora combines the short term with the long term. Thatâs my specialty. Thatâs what I want to help you with.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #7: Learn how to combine short term cash flow with long-term recurring (or at least predictable) revenue.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I want to tell you the rest of the story about my DirecTV days.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I ultimately learned my superpower while I was selling TV subscriptions face to face.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Remember when I said the word âinstallâ was the most important word when I had that job?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Well, itâs because soooo many people focus on the front end sale. But they rarely talk about refunds, chargebacks, and lifetime value.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When I was selling DirecTV I started making one sale a day by the second week. There was one other guy doing more than that...but I was actually making more money than him because of the âinstall.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I want to walk you through my sales process that took me to the best performing salesman in just 2 weeks.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, when week 2 rolled around I was able to go to my own store and sell by myself. (This meant I didnât have Timbo Slice to rely on anymore.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I switched from Samâs Club to Best Buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most guys didnât want Best Buy because it was a low traffic store. Less people go to Best Buy than Samâs Club or Walmart by a BIG multiple. But this suited me WAYYY better.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Why?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Because it allowed me to develop a relationship with my potential buyers BEFORE I sold them anything.</div>

            The more you focus on the relationship BEFORE you sell, the more youâll sell. Which is something youâll see in action when I tell you the Old Man story.

        <div>My strategy was pretty simple. I had a table to sell from, but I would stray from the table and meet customers wherever they were in the store.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: Do NOT rely on people to come to you. You must meet them where they are. This has multiple meanings and layers.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You have to meet them where they are physically. Where do your buyers hang out? What websites? What social media platforms? What stores do they go to? Which aisle in the store?<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            First off, you can have the best pitch on planet earth, but if youâre posting ads on Myspace you arenât gonna make much money. If your buyers hang out primarily on Facebook but all you do is try to find them on LinkedIn youâre gonna struggle.

            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>Second, you have to meet your prospect where they are emotionally and mentally. Where are they in the sales cycle?

        <div>***Super Tangent Time: Iâve spent most of my twenties becoming one of the best copywriters in the world. (Not just my personal opinion, I promise.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>I had no idea how that would translate to stand up comedy, but it turns out the principles are pretty similar in certain aspects.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>See, the first few lines of your copy or sales pitch are the most important. (Which is something youâll see in the next chapter.)<br>

            If you say the wrong thing in the beginning you can lose them forever. If you say the right thing you can gain a customer for life.

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The second you walk on stage the audience is forming an opinion about you. They are judging you. Theyâre seeing you through the lens of all their past prejudices.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This does NOT make them bad people. It makes them humans. Weâre constantly scanning our environment and making judgments so that we can SURVIVE.</div>

            <div class="mango-highlight"><strong>Itâs your job to figure what conversation theyâre having in their head and then</strong><u><strong> MEET THEM THERE.</strong></u></div>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            For example, when I do standup, and when I walk on stage people are likely to think âI donât really like this guy. I donât want him to be funny. He looks like a douche or a tool. He looks like Jake Gyllenhal Brokeback mountain-ed the guy from Twilight. He looks like some rich white kid, I hate rich white kids.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            So what do I do when I get on stage?<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I acknowledge what I look like.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Me: âI know I look like a tool. My last name is Stanley, I was literally named after the worldâs biggest tool company. I look like I wouldâve been the president of a douchey Fraternity.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Thereâs nothing worse you can be in stand up than an in shape, reasonably good looking white guy. Thereâs nothing funny about healthy white people.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Most chubby guys would look at me and think âI wouldnât mind looking like him.â But I look at chubby guys and think âMan, I want that comedy bod.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            See, Iâm aware that most people (especially the dudes) wonât like me at first glance when I get on a comedy stage. I donât look like most comedians. So I HAVE to acknowledge that or they wonât buy into anything Iâm saying...even if they think itâs funny.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I have to make fun of myself and laugh at myself to give them PERMISSION to laugh at me. To some people I look like a serious intense military dude. Thatâs not funny. I have to ease the tension.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I also have to talk about my accent.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Me: âIâm half English and half American which means everyone thinks Iâm Australian.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            This ALWAYS gets a laugh (even though I donât personally think itâs that funny) because itâs what people are thinking. Their exact thoughts are âthis guy is Australian.â So when I say what theyâre thinking, they laugh.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Or theyâre thinking âWhere the hell is this guy from?<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <div class="mango-highlight"><strong>If I donât acknowledge what they're thinking, theyâll spend the rest of my set just thinking about my accent instead of listening to my jokes and stories.</strong></div>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When someone lands on your sales page or picks up the phone or whatever it is...you have to think âWhatâs the conversation going on in their head?â And then start there.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I met people in the store WHERE they were. If they were checking out DVDs Iâd approach them ask âis there anything I can help you with?â Or Iâd comment on what theyâre looking at if I had something to say about it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>Iâd start with helping THEM. Because itâs not about me or my product...yet.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâd start a conversation and see where it went. Then, when the time felt right, Iâd ask about their TV provider. Sometimes they already had DirecTV and Iâd have nothing to sell them. No biggie.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If they didnât have DirecTV then Iâd start to talk to them about it and get them to move back to the table with me.</div>

        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: Thereâs an old (slightly creepy) thing that guys used to teach in the dating world. If you can get a girl to move locations with you it creates a deeper bond. It creates something called âtime-distortion.â When you go multiple places with someone it feels like youâve known them longer than you actually have.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The longer youâve known someone, the more likely you are to like them and trust them. (Assuming you donât suck as a human being.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Iâve even used this in sales videos. I did this a ton when I was selling water filters. I would start out in the middle of the office and then take them into the warehouse. Then Iâd switch to being outside, or in a kitchen.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>

        <div>Hereâs one of the best examples of that Iâve ever seen. This is for a Special Forces Hiking Boot. I know itâs a good sales pitch because I bought them. Hereâs part of the ad:</div>

Waterproof boots act as a microwave for your feet after theyâre shrink wrapped in plastic - so your feet sweat more and the waterproof boots trap it in.

            This will not work out well for you - youâll get pruned skin and eventually blisters that will form and then rip off, exposing raw, red skin - itâs everything bad you donât want. In Richâs words, âwaterproof boots are good if you wanna kick your feet up around a campfire that you drove to, or if youâre a prison guard in Siberia. Otherwise, stick to boots and shoes that can adapt to whatever environment you find yourself in.â<br>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In fact, that single point is one of the reasons I bought the product. I had a pair of boots before that got wet and the water sloshed around in them for the rest of the day since it was raining. It was terrible. Now I know that wonât happen with these boots.</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">One day at Best Buy an elderly man and I started a conversation. He was in his late seventies. He was kind and gentle. He didnât care about technology, but he did like watching TV. He was perfectly happy with his current solution.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            But once we got to talking he decided he was open to a new solution. He decided to buy from me.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            While he was filling out his paperwork he turned to me and said: âIan, I have no idea what Iâm buying or if I even need it. But I like you, so you better not be fucking me.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I laughed and reassured him that I wouldnât be selling it to him if I didnât think it was the best option for him.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I never forgot that old man because it helped reinforce something extremely important to me.</div>

        <div><strong>DO NOT SELL ANYTHING YOU DONâT BELIEVE IN. </strong>And donât sell it to people who donât want it or need it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs a cheesy line Iâve been saying lately:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âIâve stepped over a lot of dollar bills to pick up pennies in my career. But now those pennies have turned into 10, 20, and 100 dollar bills.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Short term profit is never worth long-term loss. (Plus, if you make money in a way that you donât feel good about, youâll end up wasting the money anyways because you wonât feel like you deserve it.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It can take minutes, hours, days, months, or years to build trust... but it only takes one second to lose it forever.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Which leads to one of the key factors for going from Good to Great:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Your Intention.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People make decisions based on how they FEEL. Thatâs why I focus so much on Feelings in Advance.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Part of the buying feeling comes down to your INTENTION. If your intention is pure, you can be average salesman but still make a ton of sales. If your intention is coming from the wrong place, you can make sales in the short term but youâll always lose in the end. (Look at the Fyre Festival guy.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât say this in a way that is âwoo-woo.â Intentions have a tangible FEEL to them. That feeling affects your sales.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: When I used to teach guys about dating, I had one lesson Iâd repeat over and over.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Women donât want to be treated as an object that youâre just trying to have sex with. If you go out with the intention of âI just wanna sleep with chicksâ youâre gonna have a real hard time. Or maybe youâll trick some women into believing you for a night or two. But you wonât meet the type of women you want to meet, and youâll end having a whole lot less sex.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Then guys would say âso if I pretend like my intention isnât to sleep with them then theyâll want to sleep with me?â
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>FACE PALM.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This bothered me more than just about anything else.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>NO. They completely missed the point.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The intention is to get to know the woman and then decide if you even want to sleep with her. Or if you want to continue to get to know her. Or, you can be straight up and make your intentions to sleep with her clear.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But women are WAY better than men at reading intentions. And thatâs the beauty of intentions...you cannot fake intentions. Theyâre either pure or theyâre not.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now, letâs be clear about something. Iâm not saying good intentions will make you a great salesman. There are plenty of broke people with great intentions.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Intentions are an amplifier. You still need the fundamental sales SKILLS to be great. The intentions are the difference between someone who makes a living...and someone who makes a fortune.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs just my opinion, but I think itâs a good one.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now hereâs why I told you all this before I actually explained the word âinstall.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, there was one guy in the office who got more sales than me. He got ten and I got seven that week. But only five of his buyers actually installed DirecTV. All seven of mine installed.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Why does that matter? Cuz we only got paid on an âinstall.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The sales were just a vanity metric. They meant high fives at the office, but they didnât mean cash in your pocket.</div>

        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-lesson: Btw, this mindset is RAMPANT at masterminds when people talk about revenue. âWeâre doing so much revenue bro. Hey look how big my revenue is. My revenue is bigger than yours bro.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâd love to say no one cares. But seemingly everyone cares! The reality is it doesnât mean much. You canât take revenue to the bank. (Well you can but itâs probably not gonna end well.) You can take profit to the bank.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The focus on vanity metrics like video views (Iâve been guilty of this), subscribers, or revenue can be dangerous. Focus on the numbers that matter. Not the numbers that you think look cool.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I sold in a way that was congruent with me as a person. That was congruent with the buyer. And that delivered on the promises I made.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I didnât deal with âbuyerâs remorseâ because I didnât sell in a way that would create remorse. And by week 3 I was making more sales AND installs than everyone else.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>At DirecTV I didnât have anything else I could sell these folks.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But with my online business the first sale is just the beginning. I just want to break even in acquiring my customers because I know the real money is my email list and follow up.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I focus not just on selling, but on CONSUMPTION. I want people to succeed with my products (not just cuz Iâm a really good human being) because if they succeed with the first product, theyâre gonna buy a bunch of my other stuff too.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I focus on not just finding buyers, but the RIGHT buyers.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Not only does that make you more money in the long- term, but it creates a WAY more enjoyable business. Shitty customers = shitty business.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Great customers = Great business.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Final note: I quit the DirecTV job after four weeks. I was making good money for my age and I was the top salesman... but it was a massive time commitment.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I was working eight hours per day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Saturdays and Sundays we worked ten hours. Wednesdays were the only day off. On top of that I was driving for over two hours per day. Thatâs over sixty hours per week.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I wanted to make a living, but I also wanted to have a life. Plus, I had already learned just about everything I could from that type of selling environment.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After four weeks I had had enough. I decided to coach tennis where I was making $70 to $100 an hour. That way I could coach for ten to fifteen hours per week and spend the rest of my time getting good at copywriting.</div>

        <div class="story-excerpt">I have a client whoâs been making it rain online since I was in high school.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Tim Ferriss interviewed him a few years ago about how to make a million a month from info products.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Heâs probably run more split tests than Iâve had hot meals.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I was working on one of their long-running sales letters and I said âI donât like that line. Iâd get rid of it.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            They got rid of it. And guess what...<strong>22% lift. </strong><br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <strong>From ONE LINE.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That actually blew my mind a bit. I mean seriously, how could one line increase conversions by that much?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Well, Iâve actually deconstructed it and figured it out.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs a really small...yet MASSIVE mistake that a ton of people make in their sales process.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And I have to come clean and say I made this mistake in almost every video I made until about a year ago.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât even want to think about how much money that mistake cost me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Good news is I donât have to make it anymore since Iâm aware of it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Plus, I can go through my own funnels and clientâs funnels and get a quick lift just by changing this line.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So which line is it?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs the first line.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now, that may seem obvious to you...and it may not.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But the first line of anything you ever write or record can dictate whether or not it will work and how well it will work.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #8: The first line of any sales message is the most important. The first thing you say will dictate everything else that happens.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So letâs start at the beginning.<br>
            What was this line that we removed for a 22% lift?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It was along the lines of:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âMy name is Mike and Iâve been a Certified Nutrition Specialist and Certified Personal Trainer for 15 years.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>All we did is take that line out.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Once we tested that and got the 22% lift, we tested a new lead and got another 20% lift.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The new beginning was:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âHave you ever heard of your âPersonal Fat Threshold?â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You probably havenât. Itâs not something your doctor will tell you about...because most doctors donât even know what it is...â

        <div class="ultra-important-excerpt">
            <div class="ultra-callout"><span class="ultra-tag">ULTRA</span> IMPORTANT</div>Hereâs where people make the mistake.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <u>The first iteration is what I call <strong>âweâ copy.</strong><br>
            </u><br>
            Itâs all about who I (or we for a company) am FIRST. Then you get into why it matters to them (the prospect).<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            This is a mistake.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You want to start out with something that matters to them.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I personally like to start with questions for some of my sales letters.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>For my Double Your Sales Challenge the first line was:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âWhat would it be worth to you to double your sales on just ONE of your funnels?
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Or one of your clientâs funnels?â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That second line is key as well. Because it immediately opens up a whole new audience of freelancers, copywriters, agencies, and consultants.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Look, I donât edit a lot. Thatâs no secret to people who know me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But if thereâs one thing Iâll spend my time on, itâs the FIRST line.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs the rule of thumb for what to focus on for your first line:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âThe purpose of the first line is to get them to read the second line. The purpose of the second line is to get them to read the third line. The purpose of the third line...you get it.â (I didnât come up with this. I think I first heard it from Joe Sugarman.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="ultra-important-excerpt">
            <div class="ultra-callout"><span class="ultra-tag">ULTRA</span> IMPORTANT</div>So if youâre ever wondering what to write for the first line, just ask yourself a simple question:<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <strong>âDoes this first line make it almost impossible for someone to leave the page?â</strong><br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Here are some examples of first lines that Iâve written that have worked well:
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt" style="text-align:center;">âWhen I was 15 years old, 5 men stole my freedom.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âTime for a new twist on an old story youâve probably already heard.â <br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âTime for a story you probably wonât read.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âJoe didnât know his marriage was going to end that night.â
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And my personal favorite...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt" style="text-align:center;">âJohn didnât know he was gonna die that night.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Each of those is dripping with enough curiosity that you feel compelled to keep reading (or watching if itâs a video).</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâll probably notice a pattern here too.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>When I find something that works, I turn it into a template. </strong>(Then I take it one step further and sell my templates. You can see how I do that at <a href="http://https//persuasionhitman.com/templates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">persuasionhitman.com/templates</a>)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You should do the same.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Go look at sales pages or video sales letters or ads in different markets and see what type of first line they use. Then adapt it to your market. You donât have to be super creative for this to work. Just donât straight up steal other peopleâs stuff. Thatâs wrong and dumb.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I like to go to OTHER markets and see what theyâre doing. So many people find out whatâs working in their market and rip it off. Stop. Doing. That.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Ok, so hereâs a little homework for you...</div>

            The reason I bring up that book is because John referred to a copywriter as a âSalesman in Print.â (At least thatâs what I remember.) I loved the idea because it meant I didnât have to be present to make a sale.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>There was a really good piece of advice he had for salespeople:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Record your sales calls and get them transcribed. Add in the transitions and make it flow and...boom...you have a sales letter. Now you donât have to be present for every sale.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A few years ago I was writing a sales letter for skin care for older women.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Guess what I did.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I called my mum.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I said âwhy do you use skin care products? What are your issues with them? What have you already tried?â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>She responded with a painfully beautiful sentence...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âI just want to look in the mirror and feel pretty again.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Boom.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That literally became the first sentence of the sales letter.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>You donât have to be brilliant or creative to hit home runs. Just let your customer write your copy for you.</strong></div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When youâre talking to buyers itâs a little different.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">

            Here are some of the questions I like to ask buyers:
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Why did you buy?</li>
            <li>What was the moment you decided to buy?</li>
            <li>When did you decide I was the person you wanted to learn from? Or we were the company you wanted to buy from?</li>
            <li>Was their a specific piece of content or sales material that sold you?</li>
            <li>What feeling did you want from this product?</li>
            <li>What feelings did you have that drove you to buy the product?</li>
            <li>What similar products have you bought in the past, if any? What did you like about them or dislike?</li>
            <li>What result do/did you want to get from this product?</li>
        </ul>
        <div>This is a great place to start.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs also something you can do via email if youâre really resistant to the phone...or if you just want MORE data. I would recommend both.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I personally used simple âreply emailsâ to get data AND make sales at the same time. In fact, reply emails are how I took the LionHeart Workshop from literally nothing...to doing $90k in its third month from a tiny email list of 3,000 people. (You can learn in-depth about âreply emailsâ in the Double Your Sales Challenge.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs a quick email you can use for your buyers to get great insights and data:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âHey, just a quick question for you...<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            What made you buy X product? Iâd love to know so I can better serve you and our other customers. Just hit reply and let me know.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Your answer can be one sentence like âgreat priceâ or an entire novel if you feel like it.â
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Now letâs take this a step further. How do you use the information from these calls and emails to create a deep bond with your prospects?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This is a little more advanced, but since youâve made it this far I know youâre ready for it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #9: Use the same language your prospects use.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You focus on the LANGUAGE of your prospects. Identify the words, phrases, lingo, etc that your target demographic uses.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I swear to you this may seem like a little thing. Itâs NOT. This can make the difference between a struggling salesperson and the woman whoâs at the top of the leaderboard every week.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Let me give you a couple examples to really drill this home...</div>
        <ul>
            <li>If someone talks to me about tennis I can tell immediately if they actually understand the sport from just a couple of words. For example, if they call it a âtennis gameâ instead of a âtennis matchâ then theyâre pretty much clueless. At least too clueless for me to take anything they say seriously. If someone wanted to sell me something tennis related they could literally lose the sale just with that one misused phrase.</li>
            <li>Think of a parent whoâs trying to fit in with their teenage kids. Imagine a dorky white dad whoâs wearing cargo shorts, a baggy tee, a golf hat, and the worldâs whitest new balance speakers. He says to his 13 year old son: âYou stoked for the party tonight? I heard itâs gonna be lit fam. Make sure to hashtag it on the twittergram.â</li>
        </ul>
        <div>You INSTANTLY know that heâs a fake. A poser. A fraud. A wannabe. Heâs needy and itâs incongruent. You donât want to be âthat guyâ when youâre making a sale.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you want to be the best, then you need to use the same language as your prospect. This does NOT mean be incongruent or fake. (You saw how well that worked for Suburban Dad.) It means you need to at least understand the right terminology for your market.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This is why it can be incredibly powerful to create a list of âcustomer phrasesâ for your market. And a step deeper, âemotional trigger phrases.â I know most people wonât do that and thatâs ok. But I promise itâll make a difference if you do.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One of the best ways to create your list (other than getting on the phone) is to go read a bunch of Amazon reviews for your product or similar products. Go to sub Reddits about your topic. Find forums. Send surveys to your customers or email lists. Read Facebook comments on threads about your topic.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You want to go to where your prospect hangs out - whether thatâs online or offline.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The real power here is when you can repeat back to them the phrases that theyâre already hearing in their head.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt" style="text-align:center;">âI just want to look in the mirror and feel pretty again.â<br><br>âI just want to be able to play with my granddaughter without getting out of breath.â<br><br>âWhenever I see a pretty girl I think thereâs no way sheâd ever want to talk to me.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you can hit them with a script thatâs already in their head, the sale becomes effortless.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You can go as shallow or as deep as you want with this.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I have a guy friend who wrote a sales letter as a woman. The first woman who looked at it said âthis was clearly written by a guy. Itâs clearly incongruent and everyone will be able to tell.â After she said that, he did a ton of research like I explained above and BOOM... the language was so dialed in that the original woman who read it thought he had it rewritten by a woman.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The more research you do, the better youâll be.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The good news is you really only have to do this research from scratch when youâre entering a new market. Thatâs why I only write copy in a couple of niches if I do any freelancing. I donât wanna go through the whole research phase again. I know my markets...and I know which markets I donât know. You only have to do an incredible job with research once if you stay in the same space selling the same thing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât want to sugarcoat this though. The few people non- lazy people who do the real research are the ones who make the big bucks. Iâm naturally lazy, but I know how important this is so I hang up my lazy hat and get my hands dirty when Iâm doing something new. You should too.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="mini-lesson">Mini-Lesson: The more research you do, the more sales youâll make.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            (Exception: sometimes you already know enough and you need to just write the copy, pick up the phone, sell the thing, etc. Donât let research turn into a sneaky form of procrastination.)
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A final note about knowing your customer: When I started doing sales calls for my business, people often said to me âThatâs EXACTLY how I feel, I feel like youâre reading my journal (or my mind).â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That may sound creepy, but thatâs when you know youâve really struck a chord. And guess what? Every single person who said that became a buyer. THATâs the power of knowing your customer.</div>

        <div>Thereâs a great book I read a few years ago called âThe Click Moment.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs a really good read. I recommend it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One of the core concepts is that a lot of success is random and out of our control. But the way we can use that randomness to our advantage is to expose ourselves to a lot of different stimuli and situations.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">One of the best stories in the book is about Starbucks. Basically Howard Schultz was in Milan and he skipped his conference because he got lured in by the espresso bars.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            He was supposed to be attending an event about coffee supplies... but instead he found himself going from espresso bar to espresso bar. He tried a Latte and called it the âperfect drink.â He found out there were 1500 espresso bars just in Milan.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Thatâs when it hit him...no one in America knows about this. At the time, Starbucks was selling bags of coffee and high end coffee supplies. He realized that coffee was more about the community and the atmosphere. It was meant to be enjoyed with others.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            That was his big idea...his âclick momentâ...and it built a monster of a business.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            No one, including Howard, couldâve predicted what he learned on that trip.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And thatâs part of this whole process of deep diving into your customers. You never know what sentence theyâre going to say to you that will make it all âclick.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But thatâs not all...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>...thereâs another type of âclick moment.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This click moment is based on your content or your sales material.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs that moment where your prospect decides theyâre going to buy from you or your company.</div>

        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          <strong>Rule #10: Identify your âclick moment.â</strong>
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It may happen 2 minutes before they buy. It may happen 2 weeks before they buy...or even 2 months or longer before they buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>No matter what...there is always a click moment.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Discovering what that is for most of your buyers can be an absolute game changer. And I do NOT say that lightly.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Letâs take my 8020 Email Copy Course for example.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I assumed people bought because they realized I knew what I was doing since I had tested so much email copy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Turns out thatâs not the reason most people buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>There are two âclick momentsâ for that product.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="important-point-excerpt">On my webinars or trainings I write an email live on camera. They get to watch over my shoulder as I do it. I typically write these emails in 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People tell me âwhen I saw you write that email that quickly I KNEW I needed to learn from you.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To me itâs the most normal thing in the world. Itâs just me writing an email. But to them itâs one of the most amazing things theyâve ever seen because theyâre busy slaving over each email for 2 hours or more.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If I hadnât asked people when they decided to buy...Iâd have no idea.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I also only wrote emails live on camera some of the time. Now I know I have to do it every single time. Itâs also something I can build an entire marketing campaign around. Pretty big deal.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="important-point-excerpt">The second click moment is an email I send out every few months. I call it âThe Poseidon Story.â Itâs a story about my dog and what he and I went through right after I got him.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs one of the most emotional stories Iâve ever written. It has almost nothing to do with copywriting or marketing... and thereâs no link to buy anything in the email.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But that email gets more responses than anything else Iâve ever written. And itâs LONG. Thousands of words long.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Yet I get countless responses each time I send it that say âI read every single word. This made me cry. Iâm so grateful you shared this.â Or they write LONG 10 paragraph novels sharing their own stories.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs when you know youâve got gold...when people feel compelled to share their own stories with you. But weâll get deeper into the best type of sales stories at the end of the book.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason Iâm telling you about this âclick momentâ is because Iâve gotten emails from customers that say âI bought today, but you actually sold me 3 days ago when I read the story about your dog.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If I didnât ask people why they bought, I wouldnât know how important that story is to my sales process. (It was also extremely important to my life...and I had no intention of using it to sell when I wrote it.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This story is so integral to my life and brand that I use at the start of my email autoresponder sequences to build a bond with my audience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A couple months ago I went even further with it. I recorded a video of me telling the story at the Grand Canyon. I shared it on Facebook and people went crazy for it. We spent $187 on it in the first week and then stopped spending on it. At the time of this writing it has 2.4 million views. 59k likes. 31k shares. And 4.1k comments.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But hereâs the crazy part...Itâs 9 minutes long which almost anyone will say is too long for Facebook. Thatâs basically a 4 hour movie for Facebook. Yet an insane percentage of people watch all 9 minutes because theyâre so bought into the story. Of those 4,000+ comments almost all of them are LONG comments with pictures and stories about their own dog. Iâve gained thousands of followers from it...but way more importantly I get messages EVERY day from people who say how much it meant to them. People who ask if they can shake my hand if weâre ever in the same area. People who say they were on the edge of suicide and it saved their life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm not telling you all those stats to brag. (Thatâs hardly viral or impressive to many people.) Iâm telling you about that because that story is a click moment for my audience. Itâs the moment people decide âI wanna follow this guy.â Yes, I couldâve done a shorter 3 minute version that might have gotten tens of millions of views.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But think about someone who has gone through a deeply emotional story with me for 9 minutes. Itâs not just âsome cool videoâ they saw. Itâs something theyâll never forget. Iâd rather have a smaller following that hangs on my every word than a big following that âKindaâ likes me.</div>

        <div>Only a small percentage of your prospects will ever buy from you. Identify the moments that get them addicted to you and youâll have a loyal following you can profit from for the rest of your life. Donât forget that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And remember, telling your story isnât selfish. People are watching/listening/reading your story and thinking about themselves. Your story can change lives. You just have to find out which ones to share...which is exactly what weâre about to cover in one of the final chapters...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Before we get to that, hereâs some homework if youâre up for it:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Identify your âclick moments.â</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Reach out to your customers and ask what moment they decided to buy. Or what piece of content brought them into your world. Or what email shifted everything for them. Or what sentence you said on the phone.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You should be able to identify at least one âclick moment.â But there may be a few of them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Or your click moment may be when they decided to start consuming your content. Thatâs not a buying moment...but itâs a big one.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div class="story-excerpt">Todd Herman told me he asked his buyers how they found out about him and almost all of them said it was a video he did about âgrit.â <br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            This blew him away. He hadnât promoted that video in forever. Suddenly he realized that he was sitting on his most important piece of content. Thatâs invaluable insight. (Btw, Todd wrote a book called the Alter Ego Effect that I highly recommend you read. His work was part of the inspiration for the Second Self. Also Iâm one of the main characters in chapter 3 so check it out.)

            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>The point of sales is NOT to solve a problem. Thatâs the purpose of the product or service youâre selling.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>

        </div>
        <div>This single concept can radically change your sales.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Let me give you some examples.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">I have a world class copywriter friend who sold a product about how to get your ex back. The entire sales letter was designed around how to give them the exact result they wanted - getting back with their ex.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Yet the product itself was primarily designed to help people get over their ex. Yes, the strategies would help them get their ex back. But the main goal was actually to help them get over their ex so they could move on and enjoy their life again.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            This is a huge distinction that I want to hammer home. If he wrote a sales letter that said âhow to get over your exâ it would hardly sell. Why? Because these people didnât want to get over their ex, they wanted them back!<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The reality of human nature is that most people rarely know they need. But they know what they want. <br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <div class="mango-highlight">Your purpose as a salesperson is to meet them where they are and sell them what they WANT. Then provide them with the actual solution they NEED.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This does NOT mean Iâm giving you permission to bait and switch people.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If someone says âI want a Ferrariâ and you sell them a Ferrari but give them a Honda cuz thatâs all they need...that makes you an asshole. This concept does not apply in that situation.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">I used to teach dating bootcamps to men. In this situation it was incredibly important to sell them what they want and give them what they need.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            You know what dudes who struggle with women want? They want the perfect pick up line. They want to know some âmagical phraseâ thatâs going to make women want them. They want to know what to say and how to approach women.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The reality is there is no perfect line. Thereâs no âgameâ thatâs going to truly help them attract who they want.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            The harsh truth is that they have to change how they feel about themselves in order to change how other people feel about them. But that doesnât sell products. And if your product actually helps people then you have an ethical duty to do everything in your power to sell it - without lying of course.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            <div class="mango-highlight">You sell them the product about how to meet the woman of their dreams...and then you teach them how to actually like themselves so that women will like them too.</div>

        <div>I really hope this is hitting home for you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The type of people who REALLY need this concept are the people who say âmy product is so great people should want it. They NEED this. The world NEEDS this.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Guess what? No one gives a fuck about your product. They care about themselves. You have to demonstrate how and why this product will give them what they want.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs important to have a great product to build a long-term sustainable business. But it doesnât matter how life changing your product is if you canât sell it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Do NOT get stuck in the trap of thinking people need your product. Or that people are going to magically decide that what you have is exactly what they want.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You are the bridge between where they are and where they want to be. It doesnât matter if youâre selling self-help or a vacuum.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People donât want self-help. They want to feel better or relieve their pain. People donât want a vacuum. They want clean carpets. Even deeper than that, they want their friends to be impressed by their clean carpets.</div>

      </h3>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After looking at the data behind some of my best sales funnels and messages Iâve ever crafted, I noticed there was one thing that was more profitable than everything else.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It was a specific type of story.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When I looked deeper at these stories to uncover the theme, it became crystal clear.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>These stories were the ones that scared me the most to write. They were the stories that I wrote from a deeply emotional place.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Which led me to a profound (and highly profitable) realization:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>The stories you least want to tell, the stories you thought youâd never share, those are the ones you need to share with your audience or prospects. </strong>Which leads me to...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><strong>Rule #12: Tell the stories that scare you the most.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>See, connection happens around the rough edges.
            <div class="mango-highlight">People donât bond with perfection. They donât feel connected to people or stories they canât relate to. </div>
            At the core whatâs really going on when you tell a story from an emotional place, is a transference of feelings. Your energy can be felt by the consumer of the story.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I promise you this is not some sort of hippie-dippie explanation of energy. Itâs a tangible feeling.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Ever walked into a room and immediately felt the hair on the back of your neck stand up? Ever meet someone who just makes you smile immediately? Itâs a transfer of energy. Youâre feeling some degree of what theyâre feeling.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It doesnât matter if itâs the written word, video, phone call, or in-person, your energy is transferred to the consumer of the story on some level.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People can feel what you were feeling when you wrote the story, or made the video. They can feel your feelings in your voice over the phone or see it in your face in person.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I tell the stories that scare me the most.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs not because itâs easy, itâs because it works.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why theyâre the best type of story. The ones you donât want to tell. The ones that make you want to push your laptop across the table. The ones that make you FEEL something.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And that last sentence...thatâs where the magic happens.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The energy you put into the words you write will be felt by the reader. Again, I donât mean that in an esoteric woo- woo way. I mean they will feel your emotions pulling them through the page. Theyâll have visceral reactions in their own body.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People want to know youâre human. They want to connect. They want to identify with you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Because at the core of human nature is the desire to be understood. At an even deeper level, we all just want to be witnessed and approved of.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When you write the right stories you send a message to the reader that says âI see you. I understand you. And itâs all ok. I approve of you.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But you do it without saying any of those words.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You do it by sharing your story.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One story can be worth millions. You just have to find YOUR story...then have the courage to share it.</div>

          <em>-How to Rewrite the Stories We Tell Ourselves-</em>
        
        
      </h3></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Weâve talked a lot about stories. Now I want to finish this book by talking about the stories we tell ourselves.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Last year I went to Iceland for a Wim Hof event to do some cold exposure training.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>On the first day we:</div>
        <ul>
            <li list-style="circle">Did 30 minutes of intense breathing exercises.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Spent 20 minutes outside in freezing cold weather wearing only shorts. No shirt. No shoes.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Put our hands in 34 degree (Fahrenheit) water for 3 minutes straight. Twice.</li>
            <li list-style="circle">Then that night we submerged ourselves in 32 degree (Fahrenheit) water.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât say any of that to sound tough or cool. I went to Iceland for this exact experience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I say it because it can give you some good perspective on the stories we tell ourselves.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When you walk out into the cold and your feet start to freeze you think âI wanna go back inside.â The story youâre telling yourself is that life would be better inside.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But is that really true? I think life will be better knowing what youâre capable of. Knowing that you did something hard. Something that most people would give up on.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs amazing what weâre capable of when we stop telling ourselves bullshit stories. Stores that donât serve us.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The stories get more interesting when we put our hands in 34 degree water.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You see, we constantly have a story running in our head. That story says âour hands should be warm and we should be able to feel them.â Itâs not a story weâre aware of...until we canât feel our hands.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs at that point that our mind says âI want to be able to feel my hands. This hurts. Letâs stop.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But all thatâs really going on is you have an EXPECTATION and your REALITY is not matching up with that expectation.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs where suffering comes from. It happens when our expectations and reality donât match.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So whatâs the answer? Let go of the expectations. Change the story.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If your story becomes âIâm ok with not being able to feel my handsâ then the suffering stops.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight">See, pain is mandatory. Suffering is optional.</span></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>This world is full of pain. And pain = growth. Pain doesnât always have to be so damn painful. Pain just hurts. Itâs just a feeling.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It doesnât have to cripple you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One of the simplest ways to improve your life is to rewrite the stories that are controlling you right now. To go back to where the pain came from and correct it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You can change all sorts of stories you tell yourself. Stories like:<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âIâm a procrastinator.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âI have a hard time finishing things.â <br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âIâm worried Iâm gonna lose all my money.â âIâm not enough.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âI have to be perfect.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âIâm a terrible salesperson.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âNo matter what I do, itâll never be good enough.â<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            âIâm always going to be fat, poor, unhappy, etc.â
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Or whatever other story or stories you might be telling yourself that are holding you back right now.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What if I told you you could get rid of those stories? And that you could replace them with ones that serve you. You may think itâs too good to be true.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But you need to know something... You are not your past.</div>

        <div><strong>Rule #13: Donât let the stories you tell yourself define you.</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>There are plenty of people whoâve had some really bad stuff happen to them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That sucks. Thereâs no getting around it. Sometimes life can be a real asshole. But that doesnât mean you have to be a victim of that assholery.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Which is why I want to dive a little deeper into victimhood...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm a pretty lucky guy. Iâve only really had two bad things happen to me in my life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The first one was when I was held at knifepoint.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The other thing was getting diagnosed with Crohnâs disease.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I got diagnosed about 2 years ago. And unless youâre friends with me in real life or youâve had a meal with me, you probably wouldnât know.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât talk about it too much. But I think itâs time I start talking about it. So here we go.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>First off, Crohnâs ruins peopleâs lives. 99.9% of people with Crohnâs are on (intense) medications. 70% of them get part of their intestines surgically removed.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most of them live with some sort of chronic pain, constant diarrhea, other awful things, or all of the above.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When I first got diagnosed, the doctors literally gave me no information about it. They said âeat some bland foods for a few days.â Seriously?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thankfully one of my close friends has Crohnâs and he helped steer me in the right direction. (Not thankfully he has Crohnâs but you know what I mean.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I already followed a strict diet and knew that Gluten made me puke and other bad things when I had it. But I went stricter. I ate an AIP diet. Basically the strictest Paleo ever.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I lost 25 pounds that I didnât want to lose. I had diarrhea 8 times a day. I couldnât gain a pound. The pain wasnât constant but it was a good percentage of each day. It wasnât exactly pleasant.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But through the whole time I think there was (and still is) one thing that has changed my experience of Crohnâs.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It may sound dumb...but hereâs what I say to myself. (Imagine the voice of Denzel Washington in Training Day when he says âKing Kong ainât got shit on me!â)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âI do NOT have Crohnâs Disease. Crohnâs Disease has Ian Stanley Disease. And that shit has a 100% kill rate.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>See, just because you have a disease, doesnât mean you ARE the disease. It could just be part of a bigger story youâre telling yourself. Iâm not saying it doesnât exist. Iâm just saying you donât have to be a victim to your diagnosis. You are NOT your diagnosis.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You are you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The same can go for things like anxiety and depression. Or maybe youâre a victim to shitty parents. A rough childhood. Losing your family. Or maybe itâs even worse.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>And again, I donât mean to be insensitive or say that those things arenât real. (There are chemical and hormonal imbalances that can cause all sorts of problems.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What Iâm saying is canât choose your past. But YOU get to CHOOSE your future.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The results?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Well, Iâll give you a hint when it comes to my own story with Crohnâs. You donât have to suffer like everyone else. You can live differently.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But it all starts with a choice that you wonât be a victim to your circumstances.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You are not responsible for whatâs happened to you. But you are responsible for what youâre going to do.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I donât care if itâs a life threatening disease, or deciding youâre going to make enough money to live a life of freedom.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>No matter how big or small, you canât control the outcome of your actions. But you do get to control your actions. And you do get to control your attitude.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A final story about the stories we tell ourselves...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A couple years ago I went to something thatâs sometimes referred to as âmurder camp.â Iâm not allowed to say much about because we signed an NDA but I can tell you this...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You go through some intense training for the first day. The second day you run through something called the Simulator which essentially mimics a real-life situation where youâre getting attacked again and again. The idea is that you truly feel like youâre going to die.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>As it was leading up to my turn I started to realize something...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I wasnât scared of the event. I wasnât afraid of pain. I wasnât afraid of pushing myself or getting hurt. Iâve been through plenty of that.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What terrified me most was that I wouldnât live up to the story in my head. The story I told myself about who I think I am. The story Iâve told myself ever since the knife flashed in front of my eyes 13 years ago when I got mugged.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That story that defined me. The story that said Ian Stanley is a bad ass who has never given up in his life. The story that said Iâm capable of anything.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>What if that story wasnât true? Thatâs what I was truly wrestling with.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It wasnât the event. It wasnât the things that were supposed to scare me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It was the fact that Iâve fallen in love with a story Iâve told myself for years. And the pain of that story NOT being true is far beyond anything physical I could experience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But hereâs the reality that I finally understood....</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The story is just a story. It doesnât actually mean anything. Itâs something Iâve attached my identity to so that I can make sense of the world and feel safe.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs an illusion.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We all have stories we tell ourselves. When those stories are threatened we feel pain, or fear, or shame, or guilt, or anger.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs our job to let go of the stories.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So it wasnât about the physical event at all. It was the threat to my story.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My goal since then has been different than anything 15 year old Ian ever thought it would be:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To shed the stories. To surrender to each moment and realize that whether I achieve what I want to achieve or not, I am still enough.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>To decide that the external world does not get to dictate my reality. That my reality is my own to create.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We do not have to be the by product of the world around us. The world around us can be the by product of our own free will.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>In December of 2017 I started a book called The Surrender Experiment. Right around that time my girlfriend and I broke up. Or went on break. Whatever you want to call it. It wasnât the easiest thing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It was the type of thing that tends to cripple people for weeks or months.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But I was reading this book and decided to dive in 100%. I decided to conduct my own Surrender Experiment. The results have been beyond anything I ever could have dreamed of...which youâll understand more as you read this.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So what is Surrender?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>For most people it conjures up images of weakness. An army showing the white flag. Someone giving up. Arms raised in the air...full of defeat.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Or maybe...if youâre like me...it makes you think of the famous quote:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>âNever Give Up. Never Surrender.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>That statement worked when applied to war. But it couldnât be further from the truth when it comes to life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My motto has become:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
            âNever Give Up. Always Surrender.â So hereâs what Surrender means to me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It means surrendering to reality. Surrendering to what IS. It means accepting the world and this moment for what it is. Not what you want it to be.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It means letting go of your personal preferences. Would you prefer it wasnât raining? Surrender. Would you prefer you and your girlfriend didnât break up? Surrender. Would you prefer you were born in a different time or to different parents? Surrender.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          <strong>THIS MOMENT IS YOUR REALITY.</strong>
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâm sorry to yell but you need to hear it. Thereâs NOTHING you can do to change that this moment is happening right now.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But there are things you can do to change future moments. And how you feel about past moments.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Surrender is not weakness. Itâs not saying âwell this is just how things are. Guess Iâll just give up.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs saying âthis is just how things are. If I want my future moments to change then thatâs up to ME.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs also saying âthis is my current reality. Iâm going to accept it and make peace with it.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs empowering.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs a deep acceptance that you can only control what you can control. And you canât control much.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs deciding that life has much bigger plans for you than you do. Itâs taking the first step when you canât see the staircase.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs leaping into the abyss to see what it holds for you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs charging into the darkness to find the light.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Surrender is Trust. Itâs trusting that all things are exactly as theyâre meant to be.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Some people donât believe everything happens for a reason. I disagree with them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I believe everything happened for a reason. Not necessarily because itâs true. (Who am I to decide whatâs true anyways?)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I believe it because it happened. And thereâs nothing I, or anyone else, can ever do to change the past. We can only change our perception of it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div><span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight">In every moment we are faced with two choices. Resist. Or Surrender.</span></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Resistance is the source of all pain, fear, anger, guilt, and shame. That doesnât mean itâs not ok to feel those emotions. You MUST feel those emotions. You are human. Itâs part of the experience. But you can let go of their hold on you. You can surrender.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You have a set of models youâve created about life. Beliefs of how things SHOULD be.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Any time the world doesnât match up with your belief of how things should be, youâre resisting. Youâre creating your own pain.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The world, in this moment, is exactly how it is.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The best explanation of enlightenment Iâve ever heard is also the simplest.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âThings pretty much are what they are. Dealing with the world on that level is enlightenment.â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You know who said that? Rory Miller. Prison guard for 25 years. Riot control leader. Guy who was in over 300 hand to hand encounters.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>His job was to do violence.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Yet he lived in a state of deep surrender. (Iâve been lucky enough to spend time with him a few times and confirm that he lives in a way thatâs congruent with what he writes about.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Surrender is not weakness. Surrender is understanding that violence exists. Accepting that itâs a REALITY of human existence. And itâs never going to go away.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So he could surrender to fact that violent people will hurt those who canât protect themselves. Or he could surrender to the reality of the existence of violence and train to deal with it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Things arenât inherently good or bad. They just are.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs the labels we put on things that make them good or bad.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Violence is not inherently bad. Itâs just the most emphatic way of saying NO. Dead people canât hurt people.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most people are so attached to their labels that they create their own misery.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So what does any of this mean? Why am I telling you all of this in a book about persuasion? How can it affect your life?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The irony of my life is that I became obsessed with control. That obsession helped me to develop some amazing skills and change lives.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Yet our ability to actually control the world around us is limited.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why I donât watch the news. Itâs why I donât concern myself with the opinions of people Iâll never meet - or change based on the opinions of people close to me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So what can I control? What do I focus on?</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I can control my attitude. I can control my actions. I can control the way I treat the people around me. Does that mean Iâm perfect? Hell no. I make mistakes. I slip up.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But I focus on doing my best to improve the lives of those who are willing and ready to improve. I write books. I make videos. I run workshops. I smile a lot.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>My hope is that I can affect those around me so that they can affect those around them in a useful way.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hopefully this book has had some positive impact on your life and you can take what youâve learned to positively impact those around you.</div>

        </div>
        <div>Weâve been on quite the little journey together.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Weâve talked about surface level stuff like increasing your Average Order Value...and deep heavy shit like the stories you tell yourself.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâve taken a drive down memory lane with me while I reminisced about my youth as an adrenaline seeking 10 year old salesman. Youâve learned how Iâve been able to sell a lot of stuff in a relatively short amount of time.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâve laughed (hopefully). Youâve cried (maybe, but probably not). Youâve learned a lot (in my correct opinion.)</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>This is the rule that I expect people to pay the least attention to.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs easy to gloss over something that may not seem like it has that much to do with sales. But I really believe in this concept. Setting clear boundaries is my secret to working less and making more. Itâs why Iâve never overstepped my values or done anything shady to make a sale. Itâs an important first step towards building a life you enjoy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs not that hard to make a living. Itâs a lot harder to make a living and have a life. Boundaries are the key to having both.</div>

        <div>One more note: The first upsell is the most important. Focus on this above all else. Test your highest price product in this slot. Test your continuity. Test it all.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>But donât focus on your conversion rates. Focus on the actual dollar value itâs making for you.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Think about it this way.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If your first upsell is $100 and your second is $500, that first upsell has to convert 5x better than the second upsell for it to make sense. It may convert 10x better, you never know. But sometimes itâs best to throw that high priced item in that first slot to see what happens.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Focus on the first upsell above all else. Itâs a game changer.</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>Society conditions us in so many different ways that we can never be aware of all of them. But this is one that you have to let go of. You have to rewire your brain to sever this connection that so many people are attached to.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>The most common way to get paid is to trade time for money. Itâs easy. Itâs clean. Itâs measurable. Itâs convenient. But itâs complete and utter bollocks. (That means bullshit in American English.)<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            There are people whoâve made millions over the course of lifetimes. And people whoâve made billions in minutes. Time has no connection to money. Any connection it has is a construct weâve created as humans to make sense (and cents) of things. It helps us understand money, but it doesnât actually help us make more if it.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Time itself is a construct. Itâs convenient. Itâs not evil. Itâs not stupid. The concept of it will never go away. Yet you have to realize at your core that it is not real.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>We all experience time in different ways. For one person, driving a car 150mph for 60 seconds may make time feel like it disappears all together. For someone else it may feel like the longest 60 seconds of their life.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Those things we do in life that make time seemingly disappear, tend to be the most enjoyable moments of our life. If you can find ways to immerse yourself in those type of moments in your work, youâll likely make a lot more money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Think about it, when youâre in a state of deep flow, time ceases to exist. At least in the traditional sense. You arenât boxing your experience into neat little sections called minutes. You simply are. Youâre immersed.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>For me, Iâve started to take a sense of deep joy from the things that pay me for doing almost nothing at all.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Iâll make an introduction to a couple of friends who end up making a bunch of money together and theyâll offer me money for that. I take it. I have no shame about it.</div>

        <div>Money flows. Thatâs what it does. Thatâs its purpose. Itâs designed to move from one person to another. One business to another.</div>

        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Most people have a hard time raising their prices. Thatâs normal. Itâs ok. But you need to do your best to push yourself to raise your prices as often as you can if you offer a service. And when it comes to information products and physical products you need to TEST your prices. Whether itâs lower or higher, test.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">One company I was working with tested just about everything you could think of on a sales page. Headlines, copy, design, upsells, etc...but they never tested the price on their front end product. It was $47. The reason they didnât test it? It was a pain with the software.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            It doesnât matter how much of a pain it is, price should be one of the first things you test on an offer. With another client I took their $47 offer and changed it to $97. We assumed the conversion rate would go down but maybe itâd be worth it because of the extra money. Well, turns out the conversion rate stayed the same.<br>

                <li>Think about the stories you can tell to tap into those feelings at a deeper level.</li>
                <li>Construct a bridge to take them from what theyâre feeling to what they want to feel.</li>
                <li>Make them feel as many of the different emotions as you can throughout your sales message.</li>
                <li>Build tension and desire, then allow them to release that tension by buying what youâre selling.</li>

        <div>People are lazy. Most of them donât like math. They arenât gonna do it in their heads so you have to do it for them.</div>

        <div>Doing the math right is one of the best closing techniques you can ever employ.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>One of the simplest ways I do this is with higher ticket items I sell.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>For example, Iâll say </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âSo you pay $10,000 once and add $25,000 a month to your bottom line. Is that worth it for you?â</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>They almost always say <em>âYeah thatâs a no-brainer, letâs do it.â</em></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I thought everyone did this until I found out how uncommon it is. People think itâs a given that people understand that. Theyâre wrong.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>The purpose of that sentence is to get people to read the second sentence. In my opinion, itâs a strong first sentence. You want to know more. You want to know what the hell this guy is talking about. Thatâs not a common thing to think. It makes you curious. (At least I hope it did.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Do NOT waste your first sentence on flaccid messaging.</div>

Stuff by Lee Child, Vince Flynn, James Patterson, Tom Clancy, etc. Iâm not saying theyâre all amazing, but youâll notice that the first sentence, or at least the first paragraph pulls you in like a tractor beam. They drip in curiosity.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Go to a bookstore (like a real one in person) and write down the first line from a bunch of different books. Most people wonât do this, but the ones who do will become world class.</div>

        </div>
        <div>Be like Christian Bale or Daniel Day Lewis. Theyâre method actors who become completely immersed in their roles...so much so that they put their health in danger. You shouldnât go that far, but you should get obsessed with your customer and how they speak.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You wouldnât send an email in Chinese to someone who only speaks English would you? Well, thatâs what it can feel like to a prospect when you donât use their language.</div>

          Rule #10: Identify your âclick moment.â
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Every buyer has an exact moment when they decided to buy. Sometimes itâs multiple moments that linked up together to create their buying decision. A lot of the times the buyer may not even be aware of what pushed them over the edge.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why itâs your job to reach out to your buyers and find out what made them buy.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Identify those moments where it âclickedâ for them that it was the product or service for them. Ask them the right questions and the selling is almost done for you.</div>

      <h5>
        
        
          Rule #11: Sell them what they want. Give them what they need.
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>It blows my mind how much trouble people have with this one. I think itâs a two-part struggle for people.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>They either have some sort of moral/ethical dilemma with it, or they have trouble understanding it logically.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Letâs get rid of this moral/ethical dilemma first. If you have a product or service that truly helps people, it is your MORAL OBLIGATION to sell it to your prospects. You should sell as much of it to as many people as you can. Itâs your ethical duty to get the right people to buy it.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If you try to sell them what they need, you may be robbing your prospects of the opportunity to improve their lives.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>When I was teaching dating to guys, I HAD to sell what they wanted. What they needed was to learn how to love themselves and increase their self-worth. But those guys didnât know that. They thought they needed pick up lines, weird routines, and new clothes. Itâs my job as the sales person (and product owner in this case) to get them to BUY into my world by tapping into what they wanted so that I could then give them what they needed.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs an exercise you can do:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="important-point-excerpt">
            <div class="important-callout">IMPORTANT</div>Make two columns on a piece of paper. Label one Wants. Label the other Needs.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Write out everything they want in the wants column and everything they need in the needs column. Then focus on selling them what they want.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            Itâs simple but effective.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        </div>
    
      <h5>
        
        
          Rule #12: Tell the stories that scare you the most.
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>People who are feeling a lot of emotions tend to buy a lot of stuff. <span class="macaroni-and-cheese-highlight">The more you make them feel, the more likely they are to buy.</span> Weâve already gone over this in length.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The shortcut to getting to people to tap into their emotions is to tap into your own. The best way to do that is to tell the stories that scare you the most.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason we focus on the stories that scare you is because they tend to be emotionally charged. They may be hard to write. They may be hard to relive. Or maybe youâre just scared to share them because youâre afraid of what people will think.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Hereâs the thing about worrying about what others will think of your story...</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If itâs a bit embarrassing, or it was painful, or you think it makes you weird, thereâs an extremely high probability that someone else has experienced something similar. Or at least felt something similar.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="story-excerpt">My friend had a story about his bowel movements that he didnât want to share. He was ashamed of it. He didnât want to send that email out to his list. But one day he decided âfuck itâ letâs see what happens. Guess what? It was his highest- performing email ever. He got a shit ton (pun intended) of responses and sold a crap load (omg Ian stop it) of supplements.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            As embarrassing as it felt for him, almost everyone has an embarrassing bowel movement story. Not only did people identify with it and take action to buy from him, they also built a deeper bond with him because they shared a common experience.
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Embarrassing stories can be your ticket to lots of sales and long-term connection with your audience.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I learned the power of embarrassing stories when I started doing stand up comedy. (Yeah, Iâm a stand up comedian as well. Told you Iâve had an unusual life.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Writing stand up material can be hard. It takes creativity, an understanding of human behavior, typically a lot of practice, and a whole lot of willingness to tolerate fear and embarrassment. Of all the crazy adrenaline activities and violence training Iâve done, stand up is still the scariest thing to do for me.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The reason Iâm telling you this is because I found a little shortcut. See, we all have embarrassing stories from our past. Some are so embarrassing that we thought weâd never tell a single soul about them. Yet if weâre willing to embrace that shame and share our story, we typically have something very emotional on our hands.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>A lot of times the result of our embarrassment happens to be quite hilarious. Other times itâs deeply moving.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>After my first stand up set I realized I could tell my embarrassing stories on stage and didnât require all the hard work of sitting down and writing jokes. The stories were inherently entertaining.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So sit down and think about some of your embarrassing stories. Which ones could help you sell your product? Which ones scare you? See if any of them can help</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

      <h5>
        
        
          Rule #13: Donât let the stories you tell yourself define you.
        
        
      </h5>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Humans evolved telling stories. Itâs how we learn and connect. Itâs how we hand down important lessons to our children and future societies.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Stories keep humans alive. Before the written word it was the only way to pass on knowledge.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>If we didnât have stories, weâd be dead.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs why weâre so in love with them.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Especially the ones we tell ourselves.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Whether weâre aware of it or not, there are stories we tell ourselves that donât serve us.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>They may be things we learned from our childhood like:</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">âIâm stupid. Iâm always gonna be poor. Iâm useless. No one will ever love me.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            I have to be perfect all the time. I have to be the best at everything. If I donât win then that makes me a loser.<br>
            <div class="line-break">&nbsp</div>
            No one from my town ever amounts to anything.â And so on...
        </div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Everything in life is a double edged sword. Nothing is an absolute. Nothing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>Nothing exists solely as a good or bad thing.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You grew up poor? Maybe youâll always be poor...or maybe itâs the best motivator to get rich.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>You grew up rich? Maybe thatâll help you be successful... or maybe you never learned how to do stuff you donât want to do and youâll end up a lazy and on welfare.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâre naturally athletic? Maybe youâll be a pro athlete...or maybe you never learned how to practice because everything came easy so you end up wasting your talent.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Youâre not a natural salesperson? Maybe youâll struggle forever...or maybe thatâs the fuel you need to become world class.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.</div>

        </div>
        <div>Itâs our unique path that makes us who we are. But that doesnât mean we are our past.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div>We can change the things we want to change.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">

        <div><strong>A final mission for anyone who took the time to read this book (aka you):</strong></div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Sell someone free money.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thatâs not a joke. This is one of my favorite things to do with people. And itâs shockingly difficult for most people to accomplish.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div class="example-excerpt">I want you to take some cash - preferably a $20 bill. But if thatâs too rich for your blood, a $1, $5, or $10 bill will do. Or grab a $100 bill if you want a real challenge. (If youâre not in America you can use whatever currency makes the most sense.)</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>The more you try to give, the more people tend to resist.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Thereâs a reason for this, but I can only explain it once youâve tried this for yourself.</div>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>So hereâs the mission:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a monetary note to give to a stranger. Preferably an amount that makes you a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Put it in your pocket, purse, whatever, and give yourself 4 days to find the person who should get the money.</li>
            <li>Allow your intuition to guide you to the right person. When you find the person who should get the money, give it to them using whatever explanation necessary...except there are a couple of rules. -You canât say you just found it on the ground. -It canât be a tip for a server/waiter/barista/etc. -Itâs not to be a handout for a homeless person.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear, those rules exist not because those people donât deserve it, it just doesnât fit the parameters of youâre trying to do with this exercise.</li>
            <li>Send me an email to money@persuasionhitman. com with the subject line âmission completeâ once youâve completed the task and Iâll shoot you back an email with a deeper explanation of some of my beliefs about money that I think youâll enjoy. Your story can be one sentence or twenty paragraphs. Up to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="br"><br style="">
        </div>
        <div>Itâs time to go sell someone some free money.</div>
