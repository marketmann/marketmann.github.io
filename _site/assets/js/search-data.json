The Power of Just 16 Little Words... . (and how those words can change your future, forever) . Can a short sentence change the history of the world? . And more importantly, can those same words change your fate... your destiny... your future? . To answer, we simply have to go back to a steamy day in Houston, TX more than 50 years ago... . SETTING: RICE STADIUM, Houston, Texas, 81 degrees . DATE: September 12, 1962 . CHARACTERS: John F. Kennedy, Jr... and 40,000 packed fans (many of whom, children.) . In front of a filled stadium Kennedy muttered these now famous 10 words... . &quot;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade...&rdquo; . 10. Short. Words. . And America was changed, forever... . As you may remember from history class, America was losing the race to space badly at the time. The Soviets were dominating. . Kennedy knew he needed to persuade the nation with his desire to &quot;put a man on the moon.&rdquo; . So he (and his speechwriters, no doubt) went to work on his act of persuasion... eventually coming up with the 10 words you&rsquo;ve just read. . Now, although the sentence was short, the rhetoric packed in those 10 words whallowed the trajectory of the nation. . John Jordan, author of &quot;Kennedy&#39;s Romantic Moon and Its Rhetorical Legacy for Space Exploration&quot; explains the three techniques Kennedy used to move America to act... . &quot;[Kennedy&rsquo;s speech used] a characterization of space as a beckoning frontier; an articulation of time that locates the endeavor within a historical moment of urgency and plausibility; and a final, cumulative strategy that invites audience members to live up to their pioneering heritage by going to the Moon.&quot; . Just over seven years later, Apollo 11 touched down on the gray, sandy surface of the moon. Neil and Buzz took their famous walk outside and planted the American flag. . And now, think about how much space technology touches your life everyday... . From Google Earth imagery of your house... to the GPS you enjoy in your car... to listening to SIRIUS satellite radio... . Would it all have been possible without Kennedy&rsquo;s 10 words? . Now, back to you... and the reason you&rsquo;re reading this book... which surely ISN&rsquo;T for a history lesson... . To transition to your story, I need to take you to a wholly different, much colder setting... . SETTING: Agora Financial offices in Baltimore, MD . DATE: February 1st, 2019 . CHARACTERS: Me (Joe Schriefer) and the author of this book (Evaldo) . And this story starts with a question. Or, rather, a list of questions... . &quot;How do you do it?&rdquo;&nbsp;I asked Evaldo. . &quot;Do what?,&rdquo; he quipped back. . &quot;How does a Brazilian man... whose native language is Portuguese... crush every single American copywriter that I&rsquo;ve ever seen?&rdquo; . To put the question in context, at Agora Financial we eat, live and sleep copywriting. In my part in helping to run the business I&rsquo;ve personally worked with more than 100+ copywriters... . ... Many of which are the &quot;A-list&rdquo; copywriters you&rsquo;ve come to know... . And none of them... NONE of them... could hold a proverbial candle to the year that Evaldo has just had. . Just a decade before I met Evaldo he only knew a basic few English words -- like &quot;book,&rdquo; &quot;cat&rdquo;, and &quot;table.&rdquo; . Yet in 2018 alone he (somehow) managed to bring in more than 100,000 front end customers AND write more than $80,000,000 worth of backend sales copy. . And to put those numbers in perspective... . They were more than 6 times more revenue I&rsquo;d ever seen ANYONE produce. . Said a different way, 600% more than any &quot;A- list&rdquo; writer I&rsquo;d ever worked with. . And Evaldo wasn&rsquo;t even a native English speaker! . I had to know his &quot;secret...&rdquo; . &quot;C&rsquo;mon, Evaldo, you&rsquo;re doing something differently than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo; I started to ask again. &quot;Spill it... what&rsquo;s the secret.&rdquo; . &quot;It all comes down to 16 simple words...&rdquo; he said in his (still thick) accent. . As we spent the rest of the day together, he walked me through his secret &quot;16-word sales letter&trade;.&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s a strategy I&rsquo;d never seen before in any of the copywriting guru courses... . A totally brand new breakthrough that allows you to tap into your customer&rsquo;s core belief, persuade that customer, and influence action. . Just like JFK muttered 10 words that put a man on the moon, you, too, can use Evaldo&rsquo;s 16 words to alter your copywriting future... your financial future... forever. . Read this book. Memorize these 16 words. Use. Evaldo&rsquo;s system in your next sales letter. . Then, just weeks later... . Watch in amazement as these 16 words add dollars to your bank account. . Best of all, it&rsquo;s so simple to execute that ANYONE can do it... . ... Even a Brazilian man... who doesn&rsquo;t speak native English... Who invented a system that turned himself into America&rsquo;s #1 copywriter. . Sincerely, . Joe Schriefer . Publisher, Agora Financial . Introduction . &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (Britney Spears), &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; (Katy Perry), &quot;One More Night&quot; (Maroon 5), &quot;Shake It Off&quot; (Taylor Swift), &quot;Can&#39;t Feel My Face&quot; (The Weeknd), &quot;Can&#39;t Stop the Feeling!&quot; (Justin Timberlake). . What do all these songs have in common? Two things. First, they all hit #1 on the . Billboard Hot 100 list. Second, believe it or not, they were all written by the same man: Max Martin. This guy has his hands in countless blockbuster pop songs of the last two decades. With 22 number one singles in the U.S., he&rsquo;s catching up with John Lennon (26) and Paul McCartney (32) as the most successful songwriter in Billboard chart history. . What&rsquo;s even more interesting is that, unlike John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Max Martin writes songs for a diverse range of artists, from the Backstreet Boys to Rhianna to Bon Jovi. And English isn&rsquo;t his first language: he&rsquo;s Swedish. . Some of his lyrics don&rsquo;t even quite make sense. And yet, it seems everything he touches turns into a major hit. His songs just strike an emotional chord with people and make them want to sing along. . What do all his songs have in common? First, they have short unique intro, a kind of a pattern interrupt. When you listen to his songs, you&rsquo;ll recognize it right off the bat. . Max explains that he &quot;came from the DJ world.... [T]o keep people on the floor, they had to know what was the song right away.&rdquo; A great example of this is the opening to Britney Spears&#39;s &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; with its immediately recognizable &quot;DUN DUN DUN.&rdquo; . Second, all of Max&rsquo;s songs hit the chorus within a minute, and often much faster. Why? Because today&rsquo;s audience has a much shorter attention span than audiences of the past. Max&rsquo;s songs get to the point fast, before people have a chance to switch the station. . Third, his lyrics are written in very, very basic English. Most are well below a fourth-grade reading level. His songs also have simple harmonic structure, mainly 3 to 4 chords. . And finally, they develop slowly, introducing one new sound or instrument at a time. He doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm the listener with too much at the same time. And he uses those different elements to create tension and balance. . If you&rsquo;re a copywriter like myself or work in direct marketing, you can see some parallels between what Max does with music and some basic principles of copywriting. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot more to his formula for success. . After all, I&rsquo;m no musician. I can&rsquo;t play a single instrument. But my point is, this guy has definitely figured something out. As a copywriter, I&rsquo;m intrigued. Because at the end of the day, much like movies and songs, sales letters also try to touch people on an emotional level. . If Max Martin has figured out a formula for success, could there also be a secret formula for sales letters that would virtually guarantee success? That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;ve been trying to answer for the past few years. After years of studying copy that converts, reading books on persuasion techniques, and most important, writing many, many, many sales letters that were total failures... I think I finally found it. . Before finding this formula, I was selling an average of about $2-3 million a year. Nothing spectacular. I was an average copywriter who had a &quot;hit ratio&rdquo; of about 20%-40%. Meaning, for every five sales letter I wrote, only one or two would work. . That meant I spent most of my time writing bombs that made me no royalties. But I did gain something that&rsquo;s worth way more than a fat royalty check. Those bombs helped me find the right direction. They showed me what works. And what doesn&rsquo;t. . After so much trial and error, I developed a simple formula... one so simple that it can be explained in just 16 words. In theory, it made a lot of sense to me. But I had no idea if it would work. . When I first used it in early 2017 in a video sales letter I was working on, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. . What happened next blew me away.... . Chapter 1 . The 16-Word Sales Letter&trade; that Sold $120+ Million in Two Years . That VSL went live on July 2017. Within an hour, sales started to pour in. And they haven&rsquo;t stopped yet, as I write this in 2019. . So far, that single piece of copy that followed the formula has generated more than $30 million in sales. After that blockbuster, I was hooked. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be? . All I have to do is follow this 16-word method and I can sell millions? Count me in! I started using this formula in every single project I wrote. As a result, my copy has generated over $120 million in just two years, from several different offers, different products, and different ideas. The one constant was this formula. . My &quot;hit ratio&rdquo; went from 20-30% to 60%-80%. . Now, before you assume I&rsquo;m some sort of copy genius, you should know that when I was 21 years old, I knew only a few words in English, words like &quot;book,&rdquo; &quot;cat,&rdquo; &quot;dog,&rdquo; and &quot;table.&rdquo; No joke. A decade ago I didn&rsquo;t even know what copywriting was. When I started writing copy in 2013, I had zero training in direct marketing&mdash;or any kind of marketing, for that matter. . So if this works for me, I know it can work for anyone. . Yes, even if you&rsquo;re a complete newbie. How do I know? Because as soon as I started mentoring other copywriters and applying my method to their copy, many of them went from zero to multi-million-dollar sales, seemingly out of the blue. One guy (I&rsquo;ll call him Mike) wrote me to say: . &quot;Before I worked with Evaldo, I knew squat about copywriting. Nothing. I had made zero dollars writing persuasive copy. . &quot;Within five months, my very first sales letter generated over $5 million in sales. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I knew my life would never be the same. . &quot;The copywriting strategies and concepts Evaldo taught me have forever altered the direction of my life and career, and ensured my future prosperity as a professional copywriter.&rdquo; . Another guy, I&rsquo;ll call him Justin, says: &quot;Before I started working with Evaldo, I was just a 23-year old college dropout with no prospects and less than $200 to my name. . &quot;Two years later, and I&rsquo;m making 6-figures a year, working when and where I want. . &quot;While all the copywriting &lsquo;gurus&rsquo; are at seminars talking about hypothetical, theoretical bullshit... Evaldo is sitting in the corner with his laptop, writing tens of millions of dollars in winning copy every single year.&rdquo; . Brian (also an alias) also sent me a &quot;thank you&rdquo; note, saying: . &quot;It&rsquo;s crazy to think... this year I&rsquo;ll take home 10 times more money than I made last year. I paid off $30k in student loans in one lump sum payment.... Now I&rsquo;m looking for a new house to buy! . &quot;Working with Evaldo is the closest thing to guaranteeing a multi-million dollar promotion EVERY TIME you put a campaign together. . &quot;This might sound ridiculous... But if I had the choice of ANY mentor in the history of copywriting (Gary Halbert, Gene Schwartz, Gary Bencivenga)... I would choose Evaldo Albuquerque. The results speak for themselves... I&rsquo;ve got $20mm+ in sales with a little more than a year of copywriting experience.&rdquo; . Yeah, I know... Brian has lost his mind for comparing me to those copy legends. But holy shit... Isn&rsquo;t that amazing? . So What&rsquo;s the Secret 16-Word Sales Letter&trade;? . Here it is: . &quot;The secret to converting copy is to define the one belief, then answer these ten questions.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll make it even easier for you to remember. Just four words: One belief. Ten questions. . The one belief will not only help you judge the strength of your idea. It will also set the tone of your entire copy, the common thread that keeps everything together. . The ten questions will add a ton of emotional triggers to your copy. And since they&rsquo;re sequential, they will also help you organize your promo from lead all the way to the closing. . The beauty here is that these questions never change. Once you internalize them, writing a sales letter will become automatic for you. Follow this process, and staring at a blank page for hours not knowing what to write next will become a thing of the past. . You&rsquo;ll also never get lost in the middle of the project. I know that for newbie copywriters, that&rsquo;s probably one of the biggest challenges they face. I know because I&rsquo;ve been there. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the woods when you don&rsquo;t have a map pointing you in the right direction. . Imagine how much easier writing copy will become once you know exactly what to write, even before you type your first word. Your productivity will skyrocket. You know that means for you? . If you own a business, once you share this with your copywriters, you&rsquo;ll have no shortage of sales letters. This could help explode your business. If you&rsquo;re a copywriter like myself, it means more royalties! And more time to do whatever the heck you want! . I&rsquo;m telling you this because that&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me. I used to write one full package every two months, which is average. After implementing this method, I was writing one new sales letter a month. . That&rsquo;s right. My productivity doubled. Using this method, I&rsquo;ve written full packages in as little as two weeks... including a crypto offer that went on to bring in 100,000+ new paid names (before it &quot;broke the Internet&rdquo; and got banned on Google and other networks). . People around the office in Agora started asking me &quot;how the hell do you crank out so much copy?&rdquo; Some people thought I must be working 20 hours a day. But the truth is, I wasn&rsquo;t working harder. I was just working smarter. . So how does it work? . It all begins with the one belief. . Chapter 2 . Your Mission: Make the Reader Believe in the One Belief . Before the 1980s, military plans used to be extremely robust, including every single detail imaginable. What each unit will do. What equipment they&rsquo;ll use. How they&rsquo;ll replace ammunition. And so on. . There was just one problem. The plans often became useless a few minutes into battle. As Mike Tyson has said, &quot;Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth.&rdquo; . As you can imagine, a lot of unpredictable things happen in the battlefield. And when they do, everything you planned becomes useless. . After so many failed missions, the U.S. Army adapted its strategy and invented a concept called Commander&rsquo;s Intent (CI). It appears on top of every order specifying the desired end state of the operation (the goal). . Instead of being a play-by-play instruction manual, the CI provides only the desired destination. It gives everyone on the team the flexibility they need to react to unpredictable events. As Jocko Willink and . Leif Babin write in their excellent book Extreme Ownership, about Navy SEAL leadership: . &quot;While a simple statement, the Commander&rsquo;s Intent is actually the most important part of the brief. When understood by everyone involved in the execution of the plan, it guides each decision and action on the ground.&rdquo; . When you write a sales letter, you also must have a Commander&rsquo;s Intent. And that&rsquo;s exactly what &quot;the one belief&rdquo; is. It describes the ultimate goal of the sales letter. . When most people write copy, they don&rsquo;t have a mission. But how are you supposed to write copy that converts if you don&rsquo;t know the ultimate goal of the letter? How are you supposed to succeed if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish? . It&rsquo;s impossible. And it&rsquo;s a big reason why a lot of copywriters fail. It&rsquo;s a big reason why I&rsquo;ve failed many times. . With the one belief, you will know what your mission is. It&rsquo;s your North Star, guiding you all the way to a high-converting sales letter. . Officers arrive at the Commander&rsquo;s Intent by asking themselves the question &quot;What is the single most important thing we must do during the mission?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how we arrive at the one belief. . The single most important thing you can do when you write a sales letter is to make the reader believe that: . This new opportunity is the key to their desire and it&rsquo;s only attainable through my new mechanism. . That&rsquo;s your mission. Write it down. . I learned this concept from Russel Brunson, who said: &quot;If I can get someone to TRULY believe that the new opportunity is the key to what they want the most, and they can only get it through my vehicle, then they have no other options but to buy.&rdquo; . While Russel was talking about launching your business online, this concept can easily be applied to every single sales letter you write. It&rsquo;s a critical part of my formula. . The one belief will force you to find the core of your idea. It will force you to get rid of superfluous stuff and less important insights. As a result, you&rsquo;ll focus on the one idea that will drive your sales letter. . As you can see, you can break the one belief down into three main elements: the new opportunity, your prospect&rsquo;s desire, and the new mechanism. Let&rsquo;s dig deeper into each one. . The New Opportunity . Remember when I said the one belief will help you judge the strength of your idea? If you can&rsquo;t identify the new opportunity, then your idea isn&rsquo;t unique. And that means it&rsquo;s not even worth testing. . For example, &quot;eating healthy and exercising&rdquo; cannot be your new opportunity. Neither can &quot;investing in the stock market.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing unique about those ideas. . But here&rsquo;s the thing. If your idea is truly unique, then your prospect will have no idea they need it, right? That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not enough just to have something that&rsquo;s new. . In the sales letter, we also need to show why they need it. That&rsquo;s where their desires come in. They must believe that the new opportunity you&rsquo;re presenting is the key to their desire. . If they don&rsquo;t believe that, your new opportunity won&rsquo;t touch them on an emotional level. And it will be extremely hard for you to persuade your prospect. . Your Prospect&rsquo;s Desire . The main thing here is to remember that your new opportunity can be the key to their desire only if it provides benefits. It can be the key to their desire only if it will help your prospect feel more significant, respected, and valued. If it can help increase your prospect&rsquo;s mental, physical, social, emotional, sexual, or financial well-being. Or if it can decrease or eliminate the risk of events that will negatively impact your prospect&rsquo;s mental, physical, social, emotional, sexual, or financial well-being. . For the health niche, the desire could be to lose weight, lower your blood pressure, build muscle, etc. . For the biz op space, it could be to work from home, quit your job, etc. And for the financial space, where I operate, it could be safety in retirement or taking care of family. . The New Mechanism . Once your readers believe your new opportunity is the key to their desire, now they must believe you&rsquo;re the only one who can meet that need. You have to make them believe that ONLY your new mechanism can help them. . Having a new mechanism is key in today&rsquo;s competitive market environment. No matter what niche you operate in, chances are your prospects have seen everything. Remember the wise words of Eugene Schwartz: . &quot;If your market is at the stage where they&rsquo;ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won&rsquo;t work any longer. . What this market needs now is a new device... a new mechanism, a new way to make the old promise work. A fresh chance, a brand-new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before.&rdquo; . While the new opportunity reveals WHAT is unique about your solution, the new mechanism reveals HOW it works. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s the vehicle that deliver the new opportunity. It&rsquo;s the secret sauce that explains why your solution works. . In the financial niche, it could be the proprietary algorithm behind the strategy/trading system you&rsquo;re selling. . In the biz op space, it could be a mentorship program about a new type of online business. . In the health niche, it could be a unique combination of natural herbs in just one pill, which is very common in supplement offers. . Once you know your new opportunity, your customer&rsquo;s desire, and your new mechanism, you&rsquo;re ready to write down your one belief. . Here are a Few Examples of &quot;The One Belief&rdquo; . The one belief for P-90X: . Avoiding the plateau effect (new opportunity) is the key to building muscle (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the P90-X &quot;muscle confusion&rdquo; system (new mechanism). . The one belief for Jeff Walker&rsquo;s Product Launch Formula: . Warming up your prospects (new opportunity) is the key to successfully launching a new product online (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the Jeff Walker&rsquo;s Product Launch Formula (new mechanism). . The one belief for Proactive: . Attacking acne at every stage of the cycle (new opportunity) is the key to keeping your skin clear and healthy-looking (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Proactiv&rsquo;s Combination Therapy&reg; (new mechanism). . The one belief for Invisalign: . Aligning your teeth without ugly braces (new opportunity) is the key to getting the smile you want without disrupting your life (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the Invisalign proprietary technology (new mechanism). . The one belief for Subway (before Jared got arrested for child pornography): . Eating healthy fast food (new opportunity) is the key to losing weight (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through a diet based on Subway sandwiches (new mechanism). . The one belief for water pitcher Turapur: . Drinking ionized water (new opportunity) is the key to feeling young and energetic (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Turapur Pitcher&rsquo;s unique filtering system (new mechanism). . The one belief for Febreze: . Adding a pleasant smell at the end of your cleaning routine (new opportunity) is the key to keeping your home looking fresh and clean (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Febreze&rsquo;s OdorClear technology (new mechanism.) . The one belief for three different financial offers I wrote: . Getting in the trade before the news is published (new opportunity) is the key to making easy money every week (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the patent-pending Weekly Paycheck Indicator (new mechanism). . Trading penny stocks on Friday (new opportunity) is the key to making easy money every weekend (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Tim Sykes&rsquo;s proprietary news screen system (new mechanism). . Investing in private companies before they go public (new opportunity) is the key to making the biggest gains in the stock market (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the secret IPO account I uncovered (new mechanism). . And here&rsquo;s the one belief for my copy method: . Following a copy system that provides clarity, purpose, and structure (new opportunity) is the key to writing converting copy in no time (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the 16-word sales letter&trade; (new mechanism). . I could go on and on. But the truth of the matter is you could write the one belief for every single successful marketing campaign throughout history. . So what&rsquo;s the one belief for the project you&rsquo;re working on? . Once you write that down, you can move on to the ten sequential questions. They&rsquo;ll structure the promo for you, making your job way easier. . Chapter 3 . Injecting Dopamine into Your Prospect&rsquo;s Brain with Question #1 . He was a very quiet kid. He hardly spoke at all until he was three years old. In fact, his parents worried there was something wrong with him. . When he was five years old, his parents gave him a magnetic compass. And that changed everything. . He was fascinated by the fact that no matter which way he turned the compass, the needle always pointed the same direction. That new toy made him wonder about magnetic fields, which got him interested in physics. . That&rsquo;s how his lifetime journey of exploration started. Many years later, he wrote about the compass, saying: &quot;That experience made a deep and lasting impression on me. Something deeper had to be hidden behind things.&rdquo; . The name of the kid? Albert Einstein. Most of us are not geniuses like he was. But we all have that same capacity to be curious about something new. We love novelty. . And that&rsquo;s why the first question you must answer is this: . Question #1: How is this different from everything else I&rsquo;ve seen? . You must begin by explaining what the new opportunity is. As I mentioned in the last chapter, if your idea is not unique, it&rsquo;s useless. . Why? Because it will not active dopamine pathways in your prospect&rsquo;s brains. Without the release of dopamine, your customer will just ignore your message. . Cognitive neuroscientists Nico Bunzeck and Emrah D&uuml;zel used MRI images to study how the brain reacts to novelty. They found that there&rsquo;s a region of our midbrain called the substantia nigra or ventral segmental area that &quot;lights up&rdquo; when we see new stuff. . This &quot;novelty center&rdquo; of our brain is activated only when we come across something completely new. If it&rsquo;s something familiar, it stays dormant. . Here&rsquo;s how Bunzeck and D&uuml;zel explain it: . &quot;When we see something new, we see it has a potential for rewarding us in some way. This potential that lies in new things motivates us to explore our environment for rewards. The brain learns that the stimulus, once familiar, has no reward associated with it and so it loses its potential. . &quot;For this reason, only completely new objects activate the midbrain area and increase our levels of dopamine.&rdquo; . Our Brains are Wired for Novelty . If you think about it, that makes perfect sense from an evolutionary point of view. It was exploring new things that led humans to spread around the world. It&rsquo;s how we were able to adapt to all sorts of different environments. . That happened because we evolved from acting on raw instinct alone to identifying new things and learning about them. The fact that our brains release dopamine when we come across novelty probably gave us a great evolutionary advantage. . My buddy Oren Klaff talks about this in his great book Pitch Anything. He says: &quot;Attention will be given when information novelty is high and will drift away when information novelty is low.&rdquo; . He goes on to explain how humans survived in the African Savanna by detecting change: . &quot;The only way to survive from one day to the next is detecting change, because trees were not threatening, grass was not threatening, clouds were not threatening unless they moved. . &quot;Things that moved were threatening to our survival and we dedicated most of the 60% to 80% of our brain matter to detecting change. So if you don&rsquo;t characterize things in terms of change, the physical nature of our brain isn&rsquo;t attracted to it.&rdquo; . Here&#39;s the bottom line. Only novelty will release the right dose of dopamine that will get your customer into &quot;exploring&rdquo; mode&mdash;that will get them excited enough to keep reading a sales letter to find out more about that &quot;new&rdquo; thing. . That&rsquo;s how our brains are wired. Nobody can change that. If you ignore that fact, you&rsquo;ll never succeed in copy. . That&rsquo;s why your USP should always be in your headline and at the beginning of your sales letter. The new opportunity needs to feel like a breakthrough. It needs to feel like you just figured something out, and you&rsquo;re revealing what you discovered to the reader. . It could be a new cure, a new way of losing weight, a new way of making money, a new business model, etc. . In the financial niche, I&rsquo;ve written about a new law, a new loophole, a new threat, a new prediction, a new discovery, a new conspiracy, a new political scandal, a new trading system, etc. . Here&rsquo;s how I started the first sales letter I wrote using this method (the one that has sold more than $30 mil): . &quot;Hi, I&rsquo;m Alan Knuckman. . I&rsquo;ll introduce myself fully in just a moment. . But right now I want you to look at this piece of paper I&rsquo;m holding in my hand. . It&rsquo;s patent application # D0365193. . It was filed with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the invention of a powerful NEW market indicator... . The ONLY indicator in the world that can tip you off about impending big market news... . BEFORE the news becomes public.&rdquo; . Notice how I begin the letter by explaining why this is different from everything else they&rsquo;ve seen in the past. It has to be truly unique. Once you answer that question, your prospect&rsquo;s brain will be filled with dopamine. . Now you can move on to the next question.... . Chapter 4 . The Man Who Helped Ending World War I with Toilet Paper . At the end of 1914, the British came up with a new plan to defeat Germany: starve the German people into submission through a blockade strategy. . By 1917, only Sweden and a handful of other minor sources on the European continent were selling goods to Germany. . As a result, German soldiers at the front lines weren&rsquo;t getting the food, clothing, and equipment they needed. Hundreds of thousands of German soldiers didn&rsquo;t have boots, socks, or jackets. . That&rsquo;s when the Allies employed Harry Reichenbach, at that time the greatest American advertiser in history. His mission was to figure out a way to persuade German soldiers to surrender. . How do you persuade someone to become a prisoner of war? . After interviewing hundreds of German soldiers in prison camps, Reichenbach made a list of what their biggest desires were. He then wrote a short sales letter based on those big &quot;pain points.&rdquo; . Their direct mail strategy was to drop 45 million of those letters over Germany&rsquo;s lines. The result? German soldiers started surrendering in masses. So much so that it became a capital offense to pick up any pieces of paper on the ground. . Here&rsquo;s what that sales letter offered: . If they surrendered, all German prisoners would be given officer rank. As &quot;prisoners with officer rank,&rdquo; every day they would get bread and meat to eat, cigarettes to smoke, a comb, and 24 sheets of toilet paper (German soldiers had none in the trenches). . This letter worked because it immediately answered the question &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s our next question in the process. . Question #2: What&rsquo;s in it for me? . My two boys never seem to listen to me when I try telling them what to do. If you have kids, I&rsquo;m sure you can relate to that. But there&rsquo;s one little trick that never seem to fail. . If I frame my request with &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for them,&rdquo; they will listen to me. Something as simple as &quot;go finish your homework because as soon as you&rsquo;re done, we can go to the park and play soccer&rdquo; always works. . In the classic book How to Win Friends and Influence People, pretty much all of Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s secrets are about focusing on the other person. Want to make people like you? Become genuinely interested in them and talk in terms of their interests. . Use their name because to that person it&rsquo;s the sweetest and most important sound in any language. . Encourage them to talk about themselves. Make them feel important. . Do any of these influence secrets mention yourself? No. It&rsquo;s all about the other person. And your sales letter should be, too, especially at the beginning. That&rsquo;s why the most important word in any sales letter is &quot;You.&rdquo; . Dale Carnegie talks explicitly about how we&rsquo;re all interested in what we want. For that reason, the only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want. . It seems like such an obvious statement. But I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many sales letters I&rsquo;ve read that don&rsquo;t answer that question within seconds. They go on and on talking about other stuff, and by the time they answer &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;, the reader has given up reading the letter a long time ago. . Never forget: people don&rsquo;t have to read your shit. . It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re sitting at home just waiting for you to send them your offer. It&rsquo;s the opposite. . You&rsquo;re most likely disrupting their day. A lot of people are probably reading your stuff on their phone. And that trend will only accelerate in the coming years. . For that reason, they&rsquo;re looking for a reason NOT to read your letter or watch your VSL. If you don&rsquo;t answer this question within seconds, you&rsquo;re giving them that reason. They&rsquo;ll leave your page and go back to whatever they were doing before. . So put yourself in your customer&rsquo;s shoes and ask yourself &quot;what promise can I make here at the beginning of my letter that will get my customer salivating?&rdquo; . The big promise must be tied to your customer&rsquo;s key desires. . In the health space, it could be &quot;lose up to 20 pounds a month eating nothing but donuts and pizza.&rdquo; . In the biz op space it could be &quot;make $10,000 a month online without having to build a website, hire a copywriter, or even develop a product.&rdquo; . And here&rsquo;s a section of one of my sales letters with the big promise: . &quot;I call it the &quot;weekly paycheck indicator&rdquo; because it gives you the chance to collect a BIG Paycheck of $10,200 or more... Every. Single. Week.&rdquo; . Make that big promise in the first page of your letter. Because that will probably be the only chance you&rsquo;ll have to make an emotional impact. . We&rsquo;ve all heard about the study showing that people today have attention spans shorter than a goldfish&rsquo;s and that we lose focus after eight seconds. I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that number is. But the undeniable truth is that our attention span or patience for irrelevant details is lower than ever. . That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re bombarded every day with so much information that we must ignore most of it and focus only on what matters to us. And we tend to do that very, very quickly. . And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to answer the question very quickly. In my sales letters, I like to answer both questions #1 and #2 in the first page. . Once you tell your customer how your idea is unique and the big promise it can deliver, you&rsquo;ve piqued their interest. . Now you just have to prove you&rsquo;re not full of shit. . And that bring us to the next question.... . Chapter 5 . In a World Full of Bullshit, Proof is King . . Check out this ad for a 1995 Pontiac found on Craigslist. &quot;Never in your life has a car made you so appealing to the opposite sex.&rdquo; WOW. The landscape is so competitive these days that the only way you can grab someone&rsquo;s attention is by having a ridiculous promise like this one. . For example, in the competitive financial niche, the promises have become more and more ridiculous in the last few years. Doubling your money in one year used to be a good promise. . Now you have to promise doubling your money every day to stand out. Everything needs to be bigger, faster, easier... or you&rsquo;ll have no chance of competing with all the other aggressive promises out there. . Eugene Schwartz talks about this trend of one-upmanship in Breakthrough Advertising: . &quot;If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new mechanism announcement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem: overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits.&rdquo; . The problem with this race is that eventually we all hit a point where our promises are unbelievable. And that&rsquo;s why, if you&rsquo;re operating in a competitive market&mdash;and these days everyone is&mdash;you must follow the first two questions with some proof that supports your one belief. That&rsquo;s why the third question in our method is... . Question #3: How do I know this is real? . If you&rsquo;ve done your job right on the previous two questions, your prospect will be pretty skeptical at this point. If you don&rsquo;t show some proof that you can deliver on your promise, they might leave your page. They&rsquo;ll want to believe you because you&rsquo;ve made such a good promise. But they&rsquo;ll be skeptical anyway. . So you&rsquo;ll want to show some initial proof, such as historical charts, testimonials, third party quotes, etc. I&rsquo;m not going to get into the different types of proofs. There are plenty of other copywriting courses and books that talk about them. . Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important: whatever proof you end up using, you should wrap it up in an ABT structure. . What&rsquo;s an ABT structure? It&rsquo;s a simple story- telling format. . A lot of copywriters show proof and more proof and more proof, but they never create a story around those proof elements. Therefore, their sales letters become boring to read and fail to convert prospects into customers. . And there you have it. I just used the ABT structure, which stands for: . &quot;And&rdquo; | &quot;But&rdquo; | &quot;Therefore.&rdquo; | . In the book Houston, We Have a Narrative: Why Science Needs Story, author Randy Olson talks about how this ABT idea came from Trey Parker, co- creator of South Park. . In a documentary about the show, Parker has explained how he edits the scripts: &quot;I sort of always call it the rule of replacing &quot;and&rdquo; with either &quot;but&rdquo; or &quot;therefore&rdquo;... this happens, THEREFORE this happens, BUT this happens.&rdquo; . Isn&rsquo;t that brilliant? So simple, and so brilliant. . If you think about it, these three little words are the basic building blocks of any narrative. . &quot;And&rdquo; helps set up the background and give momentum to the story. &quot;But&rdquo; creates conflict, adding the tension any good story needs. And &quot;therefore&rdquo; gives the story a conclusion. . No wonder Hollywood screenwriters often follow that format when writing their logline maker, a short description of the concept. . Here&rsquo;s an example of a logline: A young man meets a crazy scientist and travels to the past in a time machine and meets his future parents. But he accidently distracts his mother from noticing and falling in love with his father. Therefore, he is forced to bring them together or he will cease to exist. . Notice that whatever follows after &quot;but&rdquo; is what really makes the story good. It&rsquo;s all about the tension. . This ABT format is effective because we are hardwired for storytelling. Just like our brains are wired to pay attention to new things, they&rsquo;re also wired to receive information in the ABT format. . A Copy Lesson from Rokia . In 2004, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University conducted a study to see what sorts of messaging compelled people to donate to a charity called Save the Children. . Half the study participants were given the story of Rokia, a little girl in Mali growing up in extreme poverty. She often goes days without food, and her family can&rsquo;t afford basic needs such as healthcare and education. . The other half of the participants were given a letter with all the facts and statistics on poverty in . Africa. Those who saw Rokia&rsquo;s story donated an average of $2.38. Those who saw the facts donated an average of $1.14. . But here&rsquo;s the interesting part. They ran the study again, but this time they gave one group both, the story and the facts. They expected that having all the information would boost donations. . But they were wrong. The people in that group donated an average of $1.43, still lower than the story alone. Why did that happen? . As Chip and Dan Heath explain in Made to Stick, Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die: &quot;The researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. . When people think analytically, they&#39;re less like to think emotionally.&rdquo; . Isn&rsquo;t that fascinating? Give people only facts, and they&rsquo;ll think analytically. . If you&rsquo;re writing a sales letter, that&rsquo;s the last thing you want. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important when you answer question #3 to use storytelling. . This ABT story format will get your reader to act emotionally, which is exactly what you want. . For example, in the financial niche you can turn even a boring chart with an indicator into an ABT format story with something like this: . &quot;The company had &lsquo;sell&rsquo; ratings... and&nbsp;earnings were declining.... Most people thought the company was going bankrupt.... No wonder shares were tanking, as you can see in the chart. . But then out of the blue my indicator flashed a buy signal, indicating shares were about to explode higher. At first nothing happened. I thought the indicator had failed. . But as soon as the market opened the next day, boom, shares exploded higher. So (therefore) had you placed a simple trade, you could have made a quick $9,500 that day.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s another example from another sales letter I wrote. Notice two important things. First, I&rsquo;m revealing some proof this is a real opportunity right on the first page, without revealing what the secret is. . Second, notice how I wrapped all the third- party quotes in an ABT format, which helped add some tension to the lead. . &quot;There&rsquo;s a lot of money at stake.... . As Forbes says, those who know how to take advantage of this provision &lsquo;may be on course for a multimillion-dollar tax break.&rsquo; . Ed Kleinbard, a former chief of staff of Congress&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Taxation, called this provision a &lsquo;complete giveaway.&rsquo; . And Bloomberg called it &lsquo;a multimillion- dollar windfall.&rsquo; . I call this opportunity &lsquo;Congressional Checks&rsquo;... . Because while 99.9% of everyday Americans are in the dark... . A handful of congressmen have already been collecting this easy cash. . The media is NOT reporting on this shocking scandal... . But I&rsquo;ll show you the truth in the next two minutes... . I&rsquo;ll even show you the documents they filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives... . Documents that PROVE they&rsquo;re collecting Congressional Checks of $115,000... $350,000... and even $2 million. . In fact, the International Business Times&nbsp;reviewed the most recent personal financial disclosure records of 44 lawmakers in the House and Senate. . And they&rsquo;ve confirmed congressmen have collected up to &lsquo;$16 million of annual income from those [Congressional Checks].&rsquo; . Does that seem fair to you? . While these politicians are collecting millions of dollars... . Most hardworking taxpayers like you don&rsquo;t even know about this little-known tax provision... . And they&rsquo;re missing out on what CNBC called &lsquo;a tax windfall&rsquo;... . Simply because this provision was buried in more than 500 pages of new tax rules.&rdquo; . If you&rsquo;re writing sales letters in the health space, instead of just citing scientific results, try to tell the story of the scientific discovery. . Here&rsquo;s an example from a successful health promotion written by Paul Amos, one of the best in the business: . &quot;In the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Warburg&rsquo;s experiments on cellular respiration... the way our cells use oxygen for energy... revealed something ASTONISHING. . In order to survive, cancer cells function in a way completely unlike&nbsp;that of regular cells. . They actually use a different cellular &lsquo;fuel&rsquo; than healthy cells normally use... . And if you simply &lsquo;shut off&rsquo; this fuel supply, cancer cells die. . But&nbsp;because regular cells don&rsquo;t have to use this &lsquo;fuel&rsquo;... they aren&rsquo;t affected at all. . The cancer cells die... almost immediately... and regular cells continue to stay healthy.&rdquo; . Can you see how this is way more effective than just citing a boring scientific paper? A narrative is always much more engaging than simply listing data, facts, and findings. . Here&rsquo;s a different way of thinking about this. Imagine you&rsquo;re talking to your prospect through a two-way radio. Your prospect is always on the . storytelling channel. If you&rsquo;re just citing facts, he won&rsquo;t get your message. You must be on the same channel. . Remember, your mission is to make the reader believe in the one belief. So the entire purpose of presenting proof in an ABT format is to help make your customer believe. Once you have some proof, you can move to the next question... . And that&rsquo;s where the magic really happens! . Chapter 6 . It&rsquo;s Time to Reveal the REAL Problem with Question #4 . Imagine trying to sell a product in the healthy diet space with the following copy: . &quot;If you&rsquo;re struggling to lose weight, it&rsquo;s probably because your diet is based on bagels, donuts, and pizza... and you never go to the gym.&rdquo; . Or imagine trying to sell a financial newsletter with this: . &quot;If you haven&rsquo;t saved enough for retirement, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re bad with money and didn&rsquo;t start saving early enough.&rdquo; . Or this one in the biz op space: . &quot;If you haven&rsquo;t launched your own online business, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re afraid of failing and not really the entrepreneur type.&rdquo; . Think any of these pieces of copy would have any chance of success? Hell no. That&rsquo;s not what people want to hear. . In general, people don&rsquo;t want to take responsibility for their failures. If you want to sell more, you need to justify their failures. . As Blair Warren wrote in The One Sentence Persuasion Course (my favorite copywriting book of all time): . &quot;While millions cheer Dr. Phil as he tells people to accept responsibility for their mistakes, millions more are looking for someone to take the responsibility off their shoulders. To tell them that they are not responsible for their lot in life. . &quot;And while accepting responsibility is essential for gaining control of one&rsquo;s own life, assuring others they are not responsible is essential for gaining influence over theirs.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s why the next question you must answer is... . Question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? . The purpose of this question is to justify your prospect failure by revealing the REAL PROBLEM. . When your prospects hit the sales page, many of them have already tried numerous similar products. . In the financial niche, maybe they&rsquo;ve tried several different investment strategies. . In the health niche, maybe they&rsquo;ve tried multiple weight loss products or plans. . Most of those probably didn&rsquo;t work for them. Maybe they&rsquo;ve lost money with other financial newsletters. Or maybe they&rsquo;ve tried a supplement or a workout plan and didn&rsquo;t lose any weight. . Whatever the situation, it&rsquo;s important to realize they&rsquo;ve probably tried something similar in the past. . We need to justify their failure by showing them the REAL reason why those strategies or products they&rsquo;ve tried in the past have not worked. . And here&rsquo;s where the simplicity of this copy method comes in. In order to find the real problem, all you need to do is reverse-engineer your answer to question #1. . I know this may sound confusing. Let me walk you through a real example using one of my sales letters. . This particular promo was selling a financial indicator that could help you get in a trade before market-moving news was published. The answer to question #1 (How is this unique?) for that sales letter was this: . It&rsquo;s the only indicator in the world that helps you get in the trade BEFORE the news is published. . Now, here&rsquo;s question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? . Answer: The real problem is that you&rsquo;re getting in the trade AFTER the news is published. By the time you get in it&rsquo;s already too late and the big gains have already been made. . See how simple this can be? It&rsquo;s simple, but very powerful. You&rsquo;re telling your customers the reason why they failed in the past is that all the solutions they tried never addressed the REAL problem. But now there&rsquo;s finally a NEW OPPORTUNITY, a new solution that addresses the real problem. . It&rsquo;s All About Giving Your Prospect Hope . Your prospects will think this could finally be what they&rsquo;ve been looking for. This won&rsquo;t fail like everything else they&rsquo;ve tried in the past. . You&rsquo;re essentially giving them hope. And isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re all really selling? . That&rsquo;s why I said before that this is where the magic happens. Without hope, your prospect will not buy. And the good news is that you can use this in any niche. . In fact, this is very common in the health space, where you&rsquo;ll see things like &quot;if you&rsquo;re working out and eating healthy, but you&rsquo;re still struggling to lose weight... it&rsquo;s not your fault. It&rsquo;s because your testosterone levels are low/ your thyroid isn&rsquo;t working/ you have bad bacteria in your gut, [insert the real problem here]....&rdquo; . You&rsquo;re revealing the real problem, a problem that can be solved only by your new mechanism. Of course, all this needs to be based on solid logic and backed up by facts. . Here&rsquo;s how I did it in that financial offer I mentioned before: . &quot;If you&rsquo;ve lost money with other indicators or trading systems in the past... it&rsquo;s NOT your fault. . That&rsquo;s because all other systems on earth that I&rsquo;m aware of are based on price data. . They only trigger a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; signal when the price changes... AFTER the big moves. . By the time you get in, it&rsquo;s already too late. . The breakthrough indicator you&rsquo;re about to see is totally different.... . It&rsquo;s a brand new way of making money. . It&rsquo;s all about getting AHEAD of everyone else... . And collecting a BIG paycheck when the information finally becomes public. . That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s protected by U.S. Patent Application # D0365193.&rdquo; . See how I took the blame of their failures off their shoulders and put it onto the old opportunities they tried? . That&rsquo;s how you plant the seeds of hope in your prospects&rsquo; minds. You&rsquo;re starting to tell them, indirectly, that they&rsquo;ve failed because they didn&rsquo;t have what you&rsquo;re offering. . And FINALLY you&rsquo;re giving them the opportunity to replace what&rsquo;s not working with something better: your new mechanism. . At this point your prospects will begin to believe that your new mechanism is the only thing that can help them achieve what they desire (a key part of the one belief). . You&rsquo;ve justified your prospects&rsquo; failures and given them hope. Now we&rsquo;re going to inject even more emotion into your sales letter by leveraging your prospects&rsquo; tribal instincts. . Chapter 7 . It&rsquo;s Time to Play the &quot;Us vs.Them&rdquo; Card with Question #5 . &quot;The end of Earth is near. You need to leave the planet now by boarding a spaceship that&rsquo;s trailing the Hale-Bopp Comet. But in order to enter that spaceship, you must abandon your human body. . All you need to do is eat this apple sauce mixed with lethal doses of phenobarbital. But don&rsquo;t worry. An unidentified flying object (UFO) will take your soul to another level of existence above human.&rdquo; . What would you do if I told you that? Probably put me in a straitjacket, right? . But in 1997, 38 people believed every word of that and followed those directions, in a mass suicide by the Heaven&#39;s Gate cult. . As a copywriter, I find this very interesting. I&rsquo;m just trying to persuade people to give me their credit card number. And here you have a cult leader who convinced 38 people that committing suicide would enable them to enter a spaceship flying in the wake of a comet. . Don&rsquo;t you want to know his persuasive secrets? . Well, one of the secrets of this cult (and every cult) is that cult leaders make their members feel like they&rsquo;re part of a special group. They isolate members from friends and family by convincing them that those outside the cult just don&rsquo;t get it. . That&rsquo;s why Scientology (yes, it&rsquo;s a cult!) advocates something they call &quot;disconnection&rdquo; as key to their members&rsquo; spiritual growth. What is disconnection? It&rsquo;s basically cutting all ties to anyone who criticizes scientology, including family and friends. . But this type of group dynamic doesn&rsquo;t happen only in cults. Our brains are wired to be tribal. According to psychological studies, any group of humans will sort themselves into us/them groups within seconds, and for almost any reason. . One study has shown that a 50-millisecond exposure to the face of someone of another race is enough to activate the amygdala. Another study has shown that fans at a soccer match are more likely to aid an injured spectator if he&rsquo;s wearing the home team jersey. . My favorite is a study showing how this happens at the subconscious level, proving that &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; happens automatically. . This study involved morning commuters at a train station in a predominantly white neighborhood. They filled out questionnaires about their political views. Then at half the stations, a pair of Mexicans began to appear each morning chatting quietly in Spanish before boarding the train. . After two weeks, commuters filled out a second questionnaire. The presence of the Mexicans speaking . Spanish made people more supportive of decreasing LEGAL immigration from Mexico and making English the official language. Fascinating, right? . If you think about it from the point of view of evolution, it makes a lot of sense. Our caveman ancestors survived only by being part of a group. The group provided comfort and protection against rival groups and the challenging environment. . Nobody is immune to this need to be part of a group. . There are many ways to make people feel like they&rsquo;re part of a group. But having a common enemy is one of the most powerful ways. . That&rsquo;s why the &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; card is so powerful. We&rsquo;ve seen its power throughout history in some of the most memorable conflicts. . Conquistadors vs. Natives in the 16th century. . Christians vs. Muslims during the Crusades. . American Colonies vs. the British Empire during the American Revolution. . North vs. South during the American Civil War. Nazi Germans vs. Jews before and during WWII. . Capitalism vs. socialism during the Cold War. . Jihadists vs. &quot;Infidels&rdquo; in acts of terrorism that continue through today. . Back in 2001, I personally experienced this &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; mentality. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, America came together. The nation was united as one. Stores ran out of flags, millions donated blood, thousands enlisted. . At the time, I was an international student trying to learn English in Nebraska. The day after the attack, I was in one my classes when a discussion about immigration began. One of the students proclaimed: &quot;Why do we even allow these international students here? We should just kick them out.&rdquo; . At that time, I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend why anyone would say something dumb like that, especially a college student. But now I know he was just putting me in the &quot;them&rdquo; bucket. If I wasn&rsquo;t an American, I must have been one of &quot;them.&rdquo; . That comment wasn&rsquo;t coming from his frontal cortex. It was coming from his reptilian brain. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced us vs. them too. We all have. We see it in our day-to-day lives... your favorite team vs. the other teams, Democrats vs. Republicans, dog lovers vs. cat lovers, etc. . Science shows that having a common enemy releases oxytocin, increasing the sense of belonging. And guess what? If you make your prospects feel like part of a group, they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to buy your product. No wonder some of the most successful ads set someone or something up as a common enemy. . Just look at what most critics rank as one of the best ads of all time, the iconic 1984 ad for Apple&rsquo;s first Macintosh. In that ad, PC users are portrayed as gray, mindless drones blindly taking direction from a Big Brother-like character. . Then enters a young, fit, and attractive woman (representing Apple) who is heroic enough to smash the giant screen. Or how about the more recent ads featured the PC guy (wearing a suit and looking like a nerd) and the &quot;Mac,&rdquo; looking cool and competent? . That&rsquo;s how Apple created an enemy, the PC and its users. And they built that common enemy into much of their marketing. No wonder Apple has created an obsessive brand loyalty. . The bottom line is that having a common enemy will do wonders for your sales letter. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the next step in the process. . In the previous question, we revealed the real reason why your prospect has failed so far. Now it&rsquo;s time to blame someone or something for that. And we do that by answering the following question... . Question #5: Who/What is to Blame? . In order to find an effective enemy, you must understand your prospect. Instead of trying to create an enemy out of the blue, you must leverage existing beliefs. . For example, most financial newsletter buyers are conservatives who distrust the media and Wall Street and, of course, despise Democrats and liberals. For that reason, Obama, Hillary, Democrats, Wall Street bankers, and the biased media have all been effectively used as a common enemy. . In the anti-aging supplement niche, a lot of the prospects are older people who already believe prescription costs are out of control. Naturally, it&rsquo;s common to set up greedy pharmaceutical companies as the enemy. . Here&rsquo;s how I set up the rigged game on Wall Street as the common enemy in one of my sales letters: . &quot;Remember that famous line from the movie Wall Street... . When trader Gordon Gecko said... &lsquo;You&rsquo;re either on the inside or the outside.&rsquo; . Well, everyday investors like you and me have always been &lsquo;on the outside&rsquo;... . I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed this too, right? . Only insiders with access to special information were able to profit from those BIG one-day moves. . The little guy was simply left out of those big gains. . That rigged-game ends today....&rdquo; . And here&rsquo;s how I set up Democrats as the common enemy in another letter: . &quot;While Democrats and the corrupt liberal media are busy trying to destroy our country... . The Republican Congress has passed a groundbreaking new law that could benefit millions of REAL Americans like you. . You won&rsquo;t hear this from the disgraced mainstream media... . But a few everyday folks like you are already collecting extra income thanks to this new tax provision... . And collecting what I call &lsquo;Republican Checks.&rsquo; . Just look what happened with Kevin Larry, from Chicago. . He&rsquo;s set to collect a massive check for $44,577 this month. . Imagine if that happened to you.... . That&rsquo;s 34 times MORE money than the average monthly Social Security benefit. . No wonder Kevin has retired comfortably... . And now, instead of worrying about money, he says: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to pursue my personal interests full time.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Once you inject more emotion into your copy by attacking a common enemy, it&rsquo;s time to give them a strong reason to act right now. . Let&rsquo;s take a page from Hitler&rsquo;s book. . Chapter 8 . The One Sentence that Killed as Many as 21 Million People . &quot;Either the German people annihilate the Jews or the Jews will enslave them.&rdquo; Adolf Hitler . This one sentence killed millions of people. Yes, Hitler was a monster. He was also a master persuader. Did you ever stop to think how he convinced an entire nation to slaughter as many as 21 million people during his brutal 12-year Third Reich? . He applied several persuasion techniques in his speeches, like the one you see above. This powerful technique is known as the &quot;either-or&rdquo; fallacy. It&rsquo;s a sentence that drastically raises the stakes by creating a false dilemma in the mind of the audience. . By using that technique, Hitler made Germans believe they had no other option. They had to kill Jews. There was no compromise. . As a result, that sentence created an incredible sense of urgency among Germans. They had to act. . If this technique can make 70 million rational people engage in horrible atrocities, imagine what it could do your sales letter. . That&rsquo;s why the next question in the process is designed to create a false dilemma in the mind of your prospect with the &quot;either-or&rdquo; technique. . Here&rsquo;s the question... . Question #6: Why Now? . Studies show that whenever you try to persuade someone, you&rsquo;ll face four levels of resistance from your prospect. . The first one is reactance. That happens when your prospect feels like you&rsquo;re trying to limit their freedom to choose or act. Nobody likes losing their freedom. That&rsquo;s why high-pressure sales techniques often backfire. . And it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s often a bad idea to mention your product in the lead of your sales letter. Because if your prospects get even a whiff that you&rsquo;re trying to sell something, there&rsquo;s a high chance they&rsquo;ll close that page. . Just think about it... how do you feel when a salesperson rings your doorbell, and the moment you open the door they ask you: &quot;Would you like to buy...?&rdquo; Before they finish the sentence, you already want to slam the door in their face, right? That&rsquo;s reactance. . The second level of resistance is distrust. And that means your prospect will be skeptical of any claims you make. We&rsquo;ve already discussed how to overcome that with question #3. . As you&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter, Question #7 will also help destroy this persuasion barrier. . The third level is scrutiny. Your prospect will need to see proof. We all know that people buy on emotion and justify their emotional decision with logic. That&rsquo;s scrutiny. As you&rsquo;ll see later in this book, Question #8 is designed to break that barrier. . Finally, another face of resistance is inertia. You can make an incredible promise with tons of proof. But that&rsquo;s still not enough to make your prospect buy. That&rsquo;s because of inertia. Staying put is a lot easier than acting on something. We simply tend to resist change. . And that&rsquo;s where &quot;why now?&rdquo; comes in. . We need to start planting the seeds in your prospect&rsquo;s head that he&rsquo;s facing an &quot;either-or&rdquo; situation. Either you act now, or you&rsquo;ll miss out on this incredible opportunity. Either you act now, or you could lose everything. . The key here is to raise the stakes. Just having a date as a deadline is not enough. You need to trigger FOMO in your prospect. . You can start doing that in the lead, and throughout the promo, especially in the offer section. After teasing an urgent event on October 26 in one of my sales letters, here&rsquo;s how I revealed the details and raised the stakes: . &quot;In fact, I want you to mark October 26 on your calendar... . Because this single event is about to catapult cryptocurrencies into the third and most explosive stage of the boom. . I am certain that Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin. . They have no choice. And this will be the tipping point that will create massive generational wealth unlike we&rsquo;ve ever seen before. . Given the company&#39;s history of staying ahead of its retail rivals... . Amazon could make the announcement as early as October 26, at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call. . Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW. . Once they make this announcement, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. . We&rsquo;ll see a buying frenzy like never before. . It&#39;ll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best Buy. . Only those who get in early will get a good deal. . Most people will be left out. . That&rsquo;s why I urge you to get in right now... . Get ahead of the crowd... . Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies straight up.&rdquo; . See how I used the &quot;either-or&rdquo; technique to create massive urgency? Either you get in now, ahead of this big event, or you won&rsquo;t make any money. . For your next project, think about how you can use this lesson from Hitler to destroy inertia and get your prospect to act. . We&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground so far, so let&rsquo;s recap a bit. At this point, your prospects have been presented with a new opportunity. You&rsquo;ve shown evidence that this is real. You&rsquo;ve justified your prospects&rsquo; failure and established a common enemy. And you&rsquo;ve teased why they must act now. . But remember, distrust is one of the psychological barriers. Now it&rsquo;s time to show them why they should trust you. . Chapter 9 . How to Make Your Prospect Know, Trust, and Like You . . Secretary: &quot;Pan American airlines, can I help you?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Yes ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;d like to speak with someone in the purchasing department.&rdquo; . Secretary: &quot;One moment please&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;How can I help you?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;My name is John Black. I&rsquo;m a co-pilot with the company, based out of San Francisco. I&rsquo;ve been with the company seven years and I&rsquo;ve never had something like this come up before.&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Well, we flew in yesterday and we&rsquo;re going out today. Yesterday, I sent my uniform to my hotel to have it dry cleaned. Now the hotel and the cleaner said they can&rsquo;t find it. And I have to flight in 4 hours.&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;Don&rsquo;t you have a spare uniform?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Certainly, back home in San Francisco, but I&rsquo;d never get it in time for my flight&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;Hold on.&quot; . A few minutes later... . Clerk: &quot;My supervisor says you need to go down to the Well-Built Uniform Company on 5th Avenue. They&rsquo;re our supplier. I&rsquo;ll call them and let them know you&rsquo;re on the way.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s how Frank Abagnale was able to get a Pan Am uniform, even though he couldn&rsquo;t fly a kite, let alone an airplane. . If you&rsquo;ve read the book or watched the movie Catch Me if You Can, you know the story. Pan Am estimates that between the ages of 16 and 18, Frank flew more than 1 million miles for free, boarded more than 250 commercial airlines and traveled to 26 countries around the world. He never once stepped onboard a Pan Am aircraft. . Instead, he abused the professional courtesy of other airlines to provide free transport for competing airline pilots if they had to move to another city at short notice. He only pulled this off because of that uniform. It gave him instant authority, just like white lab coats give doctors authority. It made people trust that he was a pilot with the airline. . And that&rsquo;s why authority is one of the key elements of persuasion, as you probably already know from Robert Cialdini&rsquo;s classic book. . And that&rsquo;s why the next question in the process is this... . Question #7: Why should I trust you? . This will be the credibility section of your sales letter. There are three main &quot;storylines&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found that work best to establish authority and make your prospect trust and like you. . The first and most powerful one is the &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; storyline. Then there are the Robin Hood and the expert storylines. . Let&rsquo;s take a look at each one. . The &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; Storyline . The goal here is to show your prospect that you (the guru, editor, etc.) went through the same challenges your prospect is facing right now. That at some point everything seemed lost. But then you discovered your new mechanism, and it changed everything. It helped you overcome all the challenges and achieve the same things your prospect desires. . This is powerful because you&rsquo;re indirectly talking about your prospect&rsquo;s deepest desires through your own story. You&rsquo;re painting the picture of how their life could be. But you&rsquo;re doing it in a very indirect way that will trigger no resistance from your prospect. . By telling your journey, your reader will think &quot;OMG, this guy is just like me. Finally, someone who gets it. That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going through right now. And he already achieved what I want.&rdquo; How can your prospect not trust that? . Here&rsquo;s how I did that in one of my sales letters that offered a penny stock advisory service. . I knew most of my prospects were frustrated with slow-moving stocks and not making much money with those &quot;safe&rdquo; stocks. I also knew most of them came from middle-class families. To make this even more powerful, I also added a testimonial/case study towards the end to show that anybody can do this. . Here&rsquo;s the copy: . &quot;You see, when I started investing... . I traded expensive, blue chip stocks because that&rsquo;s what everyone told me you had to do to get rich in the long run. . But those stocks move way too slow. My portfolio didn&rsquo;t move an inch for months at a time. . So I started trading penny stocks.... . And I started making 20%, 40%, 50% or more in profits... in a matter of days. . I also didn&rsquo;t start with a lot of money. . I grew up as a middle-class kid in a small rural town in Connecticut. . I wasn&rsquo;t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. . So penny stocks were perfect for someone like me... who wasn&rsquo;t rich yet. . But WANTED to get rich. . That&rsquo;s the beauty of penny stocks.... . You can start with very little money because they trade for pennies on the dollar.... . And because they&rsquo;re so explosive, you can make a fortune fast. . Look what happened to Tim Gritanni.... . When he started following my strategy a few years ago.... . He was selling insurance for State Farm... and he only had $1,500 to his name. . Today he&rsquo;s a multimillionaire.&rdquo; . The Robin Hood Storyline . As you know, the folkloric hero Robin Hood is a noble outlaw in Sherwood Forest who fights the oppressive evil of King John by robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. In this storyline, you will be &quot;stealing&rdquo; a secret from the rich and giving it to the reader. . This works even better if you accidently stumbled into a secret &quot;they didn&rsquo;t want you to know.&rdquo; And now for the first time ever you&rsquo;re blowing the whistle to level the playing field. . Here&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve used in one of my sales letters: . &quot;I&rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life trading derivatives on Wall Street. . As a 22-year old kid, I was already trading $100 million accounts.... . After that, the stakes only got higher. . At one point, I was personally making millions of dollars per year... . Going on annual ski trip to Switzerland, where I stayed at billionaire Richard Branson&#39;s chalet... . Attending lavish events, like the Grand Prix in Monaco... even the Kill Bill premiere in Cannes. . If you&rsquo;ve watched the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, you get the idea. . But no matter how much money I made... . I wasn&rsquo;t happy working on Wall Street. . Helping the rich getting richer and watching bankers screw the little guy wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling. . So after years of seeing the rotten machine from the inside... . I had finally had enough... . And decided to leave everything behind. . But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important... . When I left Wall Street I took an income secret with me... . One that I&rsquo;ve never revealed to anyone until today....&rdquo; . The Expert Storyline . If you can&rsquo;t use &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; or Robin Hood storylines, then your next best option is to position your main character as a guru by talking about his expertise. That includes books, TV appearances, experience, or any accomplishments that proves expertise in the field. . Here&rsquo;s an example from one of my sales letters: . &quot;I started my trading career in 1991, when I joined the Chicago Board of Trade right out of college. . And I&rsquo;ve spent the last 25 years on the trading floor... . Working through the ranks... from being a runner, phone clerk and broker... . All the way up to becoming a professional trader... . And a member of the Chicago Board of Trade... . Where I traded my own account on the floor... . And competed with the world&rsquo;s best traders. . You might have seen me on Bloomberg, CNBC, Fox Business, and other major financial news... . Where I&rsquo;m frequently invited to share my views on the market.&rdquo; . These storylines are not mutually exclusive. You can mix and match them when appropriate to make the story even more powerful. Once your prospect knows, trusts, and likes you, by this point they should be emotionally sold. . I know I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground so far. But on average I answer all these first seven question in the first 1/3 of the sales letter. Once the emotional sale is done, you&rsquo;re going to help your prospects justify their decision with solid logic. . It&rsquo;s time to show them how your new mechanism actually works. . Chapter 10 . How to Make Your Prospect Nod his Head and Think &quot;Yeah, that Makes Sense.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s a real conversation between a farmer and a doctor back in the 1920s: . Farmer: &quot;Doc, is there anything you can do for...you know... sexual weakness?&rdquo; . Doctor: &quot;Sorry, but there&rsquo;s nothing to be done for impotence.&rdquo; . Farmer, after noticing a male goat mounting a female goat through the window: &quot;It&rsquo;s too bad I don&rsquo;t have billy goat nuts. Say, Doc! Why don&rsquo;t you just put some goat nuts in me? Graft &lsquo;em on, like the way I graft Pound Sweet on an apple stray!&rdquo; . Doctor: &quot;Are you serious?&rdquo; . Farmer: &quot;Well, Doc, they can&rsquo;t be worse than the nuts I got. Just give it a try, and if it don&rsquo;t work, I sure as heck won&rsquo;t tell nobody.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s how one of the most bizarre stories in quackery began. If you&rsquo;ve read the great book from Dan Kennedy, Make Them Believe, you know the Brinkley story. . According to Dr. John Brinkley, that farmer&rsquo;s wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy nine months after the goat testicle transplant. The boy was named Billy (after the goat). . Goat testicle transplant. Talk about a brand- new mechanism. This worked because farmers (Dr. Brinkley&rsquo;s primary prospects) already believed goats were sexual dynamos. It was an accepted fact. . Heck, to this date, many people still believe that. It&rsquo;s why eating penises and testicles from donkeys, goats, and bulls is popular in certain parts of Asia. . Without that existing belief, Dr. Brinkley would probably have never pulled this off. Even though there was no scientific proof that his method worked, whenever he explained the mechanism, his prospects went &quot;yeah, that makes sense.&rdquo; . He channeled an existing belief (goats are sexual dynamos) to support what would otherwise be a ridiculous claim. . And that&rsquo;s your goal in this next step of the copy. You have to answer this next question in a way that will make your prospects nod their heads. . Here&rsquo;s the question... . Question #8: How does it work? . It&rsquo;s time to reveal how your new mechanism actually works. If you can do that by exploring an existing belief (like Dr. Brinkley did), it will make your copy stronger. . Now, we&rsquo;re not farmers back in the 1920s. Your prospects are a lot smarter now. Aside from exploring an existing belief, you better be able to explain your mechanism in a very logical way... in a way that will make you reader think &quot;oh yeah, that makes total sense.&rdquo; . Your prospect needs to understand exactly how your new mechanism gives him the end result you&rsquo;re promising. The key here is to remember that this proof and the explanation of your mechanism are also copy. As such, they cannot be boring. . That&rsquo;s a mistake I see many writers making. &nbsp;Remember, if you wrap the explanation of the mechanism in an ABT storytelling frame, your copy will be much easier for the reader to consume. . Here&rsquo;s how I answered that question in one of my sales letters that talked about a new tax law that would trigger repatriation of money. . That repatriation was my new mechanism. And I called it the &quot;cash for patriots program.&rdquo; My prospects were conservatives who already believed Trump was trying to do everything he could to &quot;make America great again.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s the copy: . &quot;There are literally trillions of dollars at stake. . I&rsquo;m talking about $27,718 on average for every American taxpayer. . In order to take advantage of this opportunity, it&rsquo;s important that you first understand where all this money is coming from. . The first thing you should know is that it doesn&rsquo;t come from the U.S. government. . Even though this is a government program, the money comes from the private sector. . The Trump administration is simply creating the conditions to unleash $2.6 trillion into the hands of everyday Americans. . You see, because the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s reserve currency... . Other countries around the world also use our currency. . For that reason, there are trillions of dollars circulating outside the U.S. . And the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has identified a stash of $2.6 trillion... mostly hiding in Ireland. . Trump&rsquo;s plan is designed to bring some of the cash back home. . In a recent speech to the Detroit Economic Club he said his administration will &lsquo;bring back trillions of dollars that is now parked overseas.&rsquo; . He believes that&rsquo;s money that belongs to American patriots. . It&rsquo;s part of his &lsquo;America comes first&rsquo; philosophy. . Why leave all the cash outside the U.S. if it can come home and help our citizens? . It&rsquo;s hard to argue with that argument. . In fact, BOTH Democrats and Republicans agree it&rsquo;s a good idea. . As Bloomberg says, &lsquo;[the cash for patriots program] may be one of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Notice how I explored an already existing belief. But I also added extra proof with the quotes from Trump himself and Bloomberg, a credible source. There&rsquo;s no way in hell my prospect will read this and think &quot;this makes no sense.&rdquo; . Once you show your prospect how your new mechanism works, they&rsquo;re ready to buy. They&rsquo;re pre- sold. . At this point, you&rsquo;ve proven that your new opportunity is the key to what they desire and it&rsquo;s only attainable through your new mechanism. . Now all you need to do is make a no-brainer offer. . Chapter 11 . From Flipping Burgers to Becoming the Richest Man Alive... All Thanks to a No- Brainer Offer . His first job was working at McDonald&rsquo;s in the summer, while also helping out his grandfather on his South Texas ranch. . After developing a no-brainer offer, this kid from Albuquerque, New Mexico, went from flipping burgers to becoming richer than Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. . It all started in his garage in 1994, when he read that the web had grown 2,300% in one year. He then made a list of 20 possible products to sell online. At the top of the list? Books. . Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. . Using scale and thin margins to offer unbeatable prices, Amazon seems to be taking over the world. Combine competitive prices with its shopping experience (1-Click checkout and fast doorstep delivery), and you got a no-brainer offer. . Who doesn&rsquo;t want to buy quality products for less money and receive them as fast as possible? With all the value they offer, you&rsquo;d have to be a moron NOT to shop on amazon.com. The key word here is &quot;value.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s where the next question of the process comes in. It&rsquo;s time to make an offer. But not just any offer. . You must answer the following question with a no-brainer offer... . Question #9: How can I get started? . Your goal here is to put together an offer so good (product/service, price, bonuses, guarantee) that will take your copy to a whole other level. In fact, if you can get your offer right, your copy doesn&rsquo;t even have to be top-notch. . As the saying goes, &quot;the product is mightier than the pen.&rdquo; So how can you make a no-brainer offer? . By creating a huge GAP between the value and the price. In order to accomplish that, you can either offer a ton of value or cut the price or do a combo of both. . Many businesses make the mistake of cutting their prices, and they end up making their products look &quot;cheap&rdquo; (&quot;with such a low price, this can&rsquo;t be good&rdquo;). They eventually price themselves out of existence. . Have you ever bought anything that was both the best in the industry and also the cheapest? No! You get what you pay for. And that&rsquo;s how your prospect thinks too. So lowering the price reduces the perceived value of your product and can actually reduce sales. . That&rsquo;s why the best option is to focus on increasing the value of your proposition. Lowering the price is for losers. Don&rsquo;t do it. . You can create the perception of value by comparing it with a higher-price product that could provide a similar solution. . For example, a hedge fund that provides a similar strategy would charge you $100,000. That way, you&rsquo;re anchoring the high price, creating the illusion that your offer is a really good deal. . You can also use scarcity (limiting the number of units available) to increase the perceived value and create urgency. . But the best way to add value to your offer is by adding bonus gifts. And I&rsquo;m not talking about just any bonuses that you slap together without giving it much thought. . Master online marketer Todd Brown talks about the importance of putting together what he calls S.I.N. Offers &mdash; superior, irresistible, and no-brainer. Here&rsquo;s how Todd explains the importance of bonuses: . &quot;The right way to construct your offer is to create your premiums specifically for the offer. Premiums should be so good and so valuable... They should demonstrate such exciting, compelling benefits... That your prospects would happily pay money for them!&rdquo; . Todd says the way you begin the construction of these premiums is by asking yourself... . &quot;What premiums would perfectly complement my main product and add enormous value to the offer?&rdquo; . Adding a few good bonuses to your offer will drive your value proposition through the roof. And it will allow you to use the value stack technique from Russell Brunson. What&rsquo;s the value stack? . You basically show the value (not the price) of each item you&rsquo;re offering and add them all up. The goal is to show a huge value that will make your final price offer look like a total give away. . For example, when you see that you&rsquo;re getting $23,450 worth of products for only $1,999, it&rsquo;s an offer that&rsquo;s really hard to pass up. . Once you offer a ton of value, then you want to eliminate the risk for your prospect with a money- back guarantee or other type of risk reversal (&quot;it will cost you nothing if you&rsquo;re not happy&rdquo;). . Here&rsquo;s a basic template for an offer that I like to use in my sales letters: . Reveal the special report (the main offer) . Introduce subscription service (you get the report when you join the service) . What others are saying (testimonials for the service) . False Close (Anchor a high price) . Extra Bonuses (Show how each bonus has value) . Value Stack (Show total value) . Final price (Cut the value and reveal final price) . Guarantee (Risk reversal) . Assuming you did everything right up to this point, all you have to do now is finish strong and avoid a big mistake I see a lot of people making in the closing. . Are you making that mistake? Check out the next chapter for the answer. . Chapter 12 . It&rsquo;s Time to Close with the Powerful Push-Pull Technique . Here&rsquo;s advice from a famous pickup artist on how to seduce &quot;a legit 10&rdquo; at a bar: . &quot;Let&rsquo;s say she has long nails which are most likely fake. Now why do 10s dress so FINE if they don&rsquo;t want the attention? Sometimes they LOVE the feeling of control. . They are in a club with friends and they want to be the leader of the circle (social hierarchy in primates) and so she gets all the attention. . The guys come and buy drinks for them and she gets off on knocking the guys down. It&rsquo;s all in a day&rsquo;s play. . Ok, so she is wearing fake nails to look even BETTER! Most guys will say, &quot;Wow you are so beautiful!&rdquo; . BORING, typical and in her mind by now, TRUE. . Imagine now, a guy comes along and says &quot;Nice nails. Are they real?&rdquo; . She will have to concede, &quot;No, acrylic.&rdquo; . And he says (like he didn&rsquo;t notice it was a put down), &quot;Oh. (Pause) well I guess they still LOOK good.&rdquo; . Then he turns his back to her.&rdquo; . This comes straight from Mystery, the famous pick-up artist featured in the book The Game. Have you ever come across as &quot;too needy&rdquo; when approaching a girl? &nbsp;I know I have. . And in those cases, my failure rate was 100%. Nobody likes a needy person. . As my buddy Oren Klaff likes to say, &quot;people want what they can&rsquo;t have, they chase what moves away from them, and they only value that which they pay for.&rdquo; . The same way you can turn a hot woman off by being too needy, you can turn your prospect off if you sound too desperate for the sale. . And that&rsquo;s exactly a mistake many copywriters make at the closing. . They&rsquo;re so desperate for those royalties... so desperate to close the sale... so desperate to finally have that blockbuster hit they&rsquo;ve been dreaming about... that it shows in the copy. . They&rsquo;re basically begging the prospect to buy. And that&rsquo;s the last thing you want to do in the offer section. . So what should you do? You should take a page from the pickup artist playbook and alternate between . attraction and disinterest signals in a push-pull fashion. . First, you&rsquo;re going to push your prospect away by making them feel they&rsquo;re in control. It&rsquo;s their decision. They have options. Maybe this is not even right for them. . Then pull them back in by reminding them of what&rsquo;s at stake. Paint the picture of what they have to lose if they don&rsquo;t act. . It&rsquo;s time to answer the last question of the process... . Question #10: What do I have to lose? . Remember, we started this whole process with the one belief. By now, your prospect either believes it or you have no chance of selling. So remind him how your new opportunity is the key to what he desires and that it&rsquo;s only attainable through your new mechanism. . Then, raise the pain levels by painting the picture of how his life will remain the same if he doesn&rsquo;t act. Whatever problem he has will not be solved. The key here is not to be needy and to let your prospect decide for himself. . Here&rsquo;s how I closed one of my letters: . &quot;Look, you&rsquo;ve seen how you could have made weekend profits of $8,780, $9,100 or even $15,820... All by using my simple weekend strategy. .

With a performance guarantee that fully covers the price of your subscription. . Now it&rsquo;s time for a decision. . The Way I See It You Have Three Options... . Option #1: Do absolutely nothing and stay exactly where you are right now. . If you already have enough to retire and you&rsquo;re not worried about running out of money during your golden years... . Then maybe you don&rsquo;t need this weekend strategy. . But if you&rsquo;d like to make some extra income on the weekends, that leaves you with two other options... . Option #2: Do it yourself. . You can try to keep track of all the millions of financial news and blog posts that are published every day... . Then try to analyze all the 1,887 stocks that are currently trading below $5... .

I&rsquo;ll put my proven news filtering system to work for you. . I&rsquo;ll do the legwork and send you my research and video alerts. . All you need to do is read my research and place the trade on a Friday if you decide to invest... . Go enjoy your weekend... . Then come back on Monday to collect your profits. . Of these three options, ask yourself... What&rsquo;s Going to Be Easier for You? . You see, there are two types of people in this world... . Those who only dream about achieving their financial goals without ever taking any action to make it happen... . And those who are ready to take action when the opportunity presents itself. . Most people will tell you they want to retire rich. . But we both know very few actually make it happen. . It&rsquo;s a natural law of financial wealth.... . The classic tale of the willful and the wishful. . Most people will keep dreaming... . While the few who are actually serious about their financial future will take action. . Since you&rsquo;ve watched my entire presentation this far, I think you&rsquo;re one of the few special ones... . One of the 250 people I&rsquo;m looking for. .

Only you can decide.&rdquo; . Notice how I only presented the options, without trying to convince the prospect which one he should choose. I&rsquo;ve created the illusion that he&rsquo;s in control. . Then I painted the picture that nothing would change in his life if he didn&rsquo;t act. But I did that without being needy. Instead, I created the impression that I couldn&rsquo;t care less what he decides to do. . That&rsquo;s how you want to finish the letter. Remember, people chase what moves away from them. . Chapter 13 . Putting it All Together . We&rsquo;ve reached the end of the road. Even though it seems we covered a lot, this is a very simple process. It&rsquo;s designed to get you thinking before you write a single piece of copy. . In fact, when I mentor writers in my team, I highly encourage them to write down the one belief for the promo idea... and try to answer at least the first seven question with just a couple of lines. . I do that myself with every single promotion I write. And I&rsquo;ve found that very helpful. It&rsquo;s a way to map out the entire promotion in 5-10 minutes. . Then all you need to do is research and start writing on the appropriate sections. . Remember the 16-word sales letter&trade; that helped me sell $120 million+ in the last two years... . &quot;The secret to converting copy is to define the one belief, then answer these ten questions.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s the one belief... . This new opportunity is the key to their desire and it&rsquo;s attainable only through my new mechanism. . Here are the ten questions... . Question #1: How is this different from everything else I&rsquo;ve seen? | Question #2: What&rsquo;s in it for me? | Question #3: How do I know this is real? | Question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? | Question #5: Who/What is to blame? | Question #6: Why now? | Question #7: Why should I trust you? | Question #8: How does it work? | Question #9: How can I get started? | Question #10: What do I have to lose? | . Here&rsquo;s what to do next... . As you know, writing copy is a very complex process. The market is always evolving... new techniques emerge... the environment change. . There&rsquo;s always something new to learn... . Which is why what I&rsquo;ve showed you here is just the tip of the iceberg. . If you&rsquo;d like to stay on top of your game... .

With dozens of digital currencies exploding as high as 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%... . Historians will call today’s cryptocurrency market the biggest BOOM ever! . And if you’re missing out… . You could be cheating yourself out of the only chance you’ll EVER have… . To turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune… in a matter of months. . And it couldn’t be easier. . Even if you know nothing about cryptocurrencies… . All you have to do is follow my simple, 3-step script you see below. . Because every single BOOM throughout history has followed this script. . The stock market boom in the roaring ’20s… . The tech boom in the 1990s… . The housing boom in the 2000s… . And now the booming cryptocurrency market is following this exact same 3-step script. . Using this roadmap, I already made an investment that returned a total profit of $1.8 million… . From one single cryptocurrency trade! . And before you guess, it was not Bitcoin… the “granddaddy” of all cryptocurrencies. . You see, Bitcoin gained a lot of publicity after it turned many regular folks into millionaires. . As The Economist magazine says... . “Anyone clever or lucky enough to have bought $1,000 of Bitcoins in July 2010, when the price stood at $0.05, would now have a stash worth $46 million.” . The thing is… . The fast money in Bitcoin has already been made. . It was easy to make a quick fortune when Bitcoin was trading for pennies. . But now that the digital currency is trading around $4,000… . It will be harder for you to make millions from Bitcoin going forward. . But if you missed the Bitcoin boom, don’t worry… . Because this year hundreds of smaller cryptocurrencies have popped up. . And unlike the “expensive” Bitcoin… . Many of These Lesser-Known Digital Currencies Are Trading for Pennies! . In fact, I recently bought another cryptocurrency for just 52 cents! . And it’s already up 800%... in just three weeks! . Many other cryptos are trading for pocket change. . That means you could get started with a single $100 bill… . And if you follow my proven 3-step script… . You could cash out with a retirement fortune just a few months from now… . Just like what happened with early Bitcoin investors. . I know that’s a huge claim… . But this kind of get-rich-quick opportunity is ALREADY happening. . Look what happened with Verge, a new cryptocurrency that improved upon Bitcoin’s privacy technology. . Most people have never heard of it… . But had you invested a single $100 bill earlier this year… . You could have cashed out with $57,236… . In a little more than two months. . Isn’t that incredible? . In my entire 30+ year career on Wall Street… . I’ve never seen any other investment that could make as much as 572 times your money… in just a couple of months. . And Verge is not the only cryptocurrency that’s booming. . Look what happened with DigiByte, a digital currency designed to protect its users against cyber threats. . Just a few months ago, you could have bought it for pennies! . And had you put in $100 earlier this year… . It would have ballooned to as much as $30,628. . Again, this explosion happened in a matter of months. . And you can make even more money if you’re a little more ambitious. . The more you put in… the higher your gains. . In the case of DigiByte, for example… . You could have turned a $2,000 investment into a $612,578 retirement fortune. . Most people can’t make that kind of money in their lifetime. . And yet, you could have done it in just a couple of months earlier this year. . Amazing, right? . Something similar happened with another cryptocurrency called Nexus… . Had you invested $100 when it was trading for pennies… . You could have walked away with $66,666! . Invest a little more, say, $2,000… . And you’d be looking at an incredible payout of more than $1.3 million. . Imagine… . You, a certified millionaire in a matter of months… from one single trade. . Do you see now why historians will call this the biggest financial boom ever? . And here’s the thing… . As incredible as these gains are… . That’s just a small taste of what’s coming in the next 12 months. . How do I know that? . Because so far cryptocurrencies are following a script that has been proven over, over and over again… . Throughout every single financial boom in history. . And according to this script… . We’re on the Verge of a Massive Buying Frenzy… Starting With a Single Event on January 31 . Even though one of my investments already returned $1.8 million from a single cryptocurrency trade… . I expect to make much more in the coming months… . Especially after January 31. . That’s when a single event is set to send cryptocurrencies into an epic parabolic move. . I’ll give you more details in just a moment. . But what you need to know right now is that I’m not just making some sort of far-fetched guess. . This is all part of my 3-step script I’ve been telling you about. . And while most people don’t know how to use this simple roadmap… . Every single boom in history has followed this script… . With no exception! . Simply put, if you follow this script… . You’ll have a chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune in the coming months… . All while minimizing your risk. . That’s the good news. . Now, here’s the bad news… . Like every single boom in history, this cryptocurrency bonanza won’t last forever. . In fact, it could be all over by next year. . And when it’s over, you’ll NEVER see a get-rich-quick opportunity like this again… . Not in your lifetime. . What does that mean for you? . It means today you have a very small window of opportunity to act… . One that’s closing with each passing day. In fact… . Every Day You Wait, Someone Else is Growing Rich from Cryptocurrencies . Just take a look at the recent gains from some of these digital currencies… . These are NOT annual gains. . These are NOT monthly gains. . These are gains that happened in a 24-hour period! . Some of these cryptocurrencies are jumping 28%... 49%... and even 90%... . In a SINGLE DAY! . Look at your retirement statement right now… . I have no idea what you’re doing with your money… . But I guarantee you’re NOT making these types of daily gains. . These gains are unheard of! . It’s why historians will call this the biggest BOOM ever! . And if you miss it… . I guarantee you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. . That’s why I’m writing this urgent message… . To show you how to use my proven 3-step script… . The same script that helped my team of venture capitalists pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months. . But Before I Give You All the Details I Should Probably Introduce Myself . Hi, I’m James Altucher. . If my name sounds familiar, maybe you’ve read one of my 18 books, including best-sellers The Power of No and Choose Yourself… . Maybe you’ve read some of my articles published in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The New York Observer… . Or listened to my podcast “The James Altucher Show,” which has more than 20 million downloads. . If you look me up online, you’ll see that the popular website Wikipedia describes me as… . “A hedge fund manager, entrepreneur, best-selling author, venture capitalist and podcaster who has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies.” . I guess they forgot to mention I’m also a computer nerd. . I wrote my first computer program in 1982 on an Apple II+… . And I’ve been a coder and hacker for the past 35 years! . I’m telling you this because when it comes to cryptocurrencies… . That’s a BIG deal. . You see, these digital currencies are created by computer programmers. . That means you can only fully understand them if you can read the code behind each currency. . And that’s my bread and butter. . I even know many of the computer geeks who are actually developing these currencies. . And thanks to my nerdy background, I’ve been neck deep in cryptocurrencies since 2013. . In fact, that same year I created what was probably the first Bitcoin online “store”… . Where I presold my book Choose Yourself exclusively on Bitcoin. . At the time, CNBC even invited me to talk about it on live TV. . The anchor was totally skeptical of Bitcoin. . He insinuated I didn’t really care about cryptocurrencies… and was just pulling a marketing stunt. . You can see my shocking response in the 30-second clip below… . . . . . . . . . | | . While I was telling everyone Bitcoin would succeed… . The mainstream media was saying the exact opposite. . A contributor for Business Insider called Bitcoin “something strange.” And they questioned “why anyone would think it’s useful.” . A CNN op-ed said it was “a big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators”… and “a bubble that could soon pop.” . And Slate published an article with the headline “Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme — the internet’s favorite currency will collapse.” . So if you missed the Bitcoin boom, it’s not your fault. . The mainstream media simply “brainwashed” most Americans into thinking Bitcoin was a scam. . Well, had you ignored the clueless mainstream media… . And listened to what I said on CNBC instead… . You would be up 3,710% today. . That’s more than 38 times your money in the last four years… . Enough to turn a small retirement account of 10 grand into a $381,044 retirement fortune! . I’m telling you this because I want you to realize that the mainstream media is clueless when it comes to new technologies. . Case in point… . Let Me Show You One More Example Where I Was Actually Mocked on Live TV . In 2007, shortly after Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion… . I went on CNBC and predicted the company would be worth at least $100 billion. . They thought I was crazy. And I was actually mocked on live TV. . You can see the short 30-second clip below. (It&#39;s quite entertaining.) . . . . . . . . . | | . Today, Facebook is worth more than $400 billion… . And had you bought shares 5 years ago, you’d be up 870%! . A few years after I made my Facebook prediction, CNBC published this headline… admitting I was right! . Bottom line… . Don’t expect the mainstream media to show you how to make a fortune from new tech trends, including digital currencies. . Because they’re always late to the party. . Without my 3-step script, they’re totally lost. . Not to mention that there’s a lot of misinformation out of there… . Some of my followers are getting scammed into investing in the wrong cryptocurrencies. . That’s why I’ve made it my mission to reveal the TRUTH about making money in this booming market. . It’s time for me to set the record straight. . So please pay close attention… . Because in the next few minutes, I will show you how to use the same script my team of venture capitalists used to bank $1.8 million in a matter of months. . I’ll show you what I’m doing with my own money… my family’s fortune… the money I plan to leave to my kids and grandkids. . Then you can decide for yourself if this is right for you. . But the truth is… . Dozens of Cryptocurrencies Are Exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and Even 81,465%... in a Matter of Months . Take a look… . The few people who understand what’s going on are already making a life-changing fortune. . People like Alan A., a 47-year-old San Franciscan. . Less than a year ago, he bought three digital currencies…. Ether, Golem and Gnosis. . Within six months, he turned his $8,500 initial investment into $7.5 million! . That’s a return of 88,000%... in a matter of months! . Incredible, right? . Sean I. from New York scored big wins in cryptocurrencies like Game, Litecoin, Ripple and Dogecoin. . And he was able to turn his initial stake of $15,000 into a $3 million fortune… . In less than two years. . After becoming a crypto millionaire, he said: . “Anybody right now with half a mind and at least four fingers can click some buttons and get in on this inevitable exponential rise in crypto and make an INSANE amount of money.” . As amazing as these gains are… . That’s just the beginning… . A small taste of what’s coming. . Because on January 31, there’s a single event taking place at precisely 4 p.m. . And it could trigger a mad rush into cryptocurrencies. . If you take a position right now… . In the right cryptos (I’ll show you which ones)… . You could turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune in the next 12 months. . And don’t worry if you’ve never invested in cryptocurrencies before… . Even if you have no clue what a digital currency is… . You could still walk away with a life-changing fortune… . Because I’ve put together an exclusive beginner’s guide package just for you. . And I’d Like to Send You This Cryptocurrency Package… FREE of Charge . It includes my brand-new book called Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies (not available on Amazon or anywhere else)… . And… . A never-before-released 6-video series Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies, where I’ll walk you step by step through the entire process. . As far as I know, there’s nothing like this out there. . I could probably charge hundreds of dollars for this package. . But for reasons that will become clear soon, I want you to have it for FREE. . I’ll show you how to claim it in just a moment. . First, let me show you how this cryptocurrency script works… . Getting Rich from Cryptocurrencies Could be as Easy as 1-2-3 . The boom in cryptocurrencies is following the same script that has played out over, over and over again. . You see, every boom follows a sequence of three stages… . First, only early enthusiasts are courageous enough to invest in the new trend. . That’s stage 1. . Then, institutional investors (the so-called “smart money”) jump in. . That’s stage 2. . Finally, the public joins the party, triggering a massive explosion in price. . That’s stage 3. . If you know how to use this roadmap, you could make an absolute fortune. . And to help you understand how this 1-2-3 sequence works… . Let me show you what happened during the 1990s boom in tech stocks. . In the mid-1990s, most people didn’t even know what the internet was. . In 1994, the morning show NBC&#39;s Today had a segment where one of the anchors asked, “What is the internet, anyway?” . While most people were dismissing the technology as a fad... . Early adopters like myself were heavily investing in it. . In 1995, I correctly predicted every company would need a website. So I started my first internet company to help big corporations get online. . That’s how I ended up building the first websites for American Express, HBO, Sony and Disney, among others. . That was stage 1 of the boom! . Only when Netscape went public in late 1995 did people outside Silicon Valley start taking the internet seriously. . That’s when institutional investors started joining the party… . With pension funds and venture capitalists making a fortune when companies like Yahoo and Amazon went public. . The additional flow of money from the “smart money” helped pushed tech stocks even higher. . That was stage 2 of the boom. . But the public was still not participating. . In June 1998, for example, mainstream economist Paul Krugman predicted the internet’s impact on the economy would be no greater than the fax machine. . It wasn’t until 1999 that the masses finally started to invest heavily in tech stocks… . With more people jumping into the market… . Tech stocks jumped even higher… . Attracting more and more people wanting to get a piece of the action. . And that was the third and most explosive stage of the boom… . With the Nasdaq soaring more than 85% in 1999 alone. . I’m telling you this because my research shows that cryptocurrencies are following this exact same script… . First, early enthusiasts… . Then, institutional investors… . And finally the public. . So keep this sequence in mind… . Because in just a moment, I’ll show you how you can use this simple script to turn $100 into a retirement fortune… in the next 12 months. . There’s no need to risk your hard-earned money trying to guess when these currencies will move… . Because Every Single Boom in History Has Followed this Script . The so-called roaring ’20s followed this same roadmap… . First, only early enthusiasts invested in the new technologies of the time, such as radio, the car and easy access to electric power. . Then in 1924 institutional investors jumped in… . Finally, in the late 1920s the news started reporting stories of overnight fortunes. . And regular folks started to wonder: Why not me? . They started borrowing money just to buy stocks. The result? . Stocks went straight up. In 1928 alone, the stock market doubled. . And it’s not just stock booms that follow this 3-step script, either. The US housing boom also followed this roadmap… . Take a look… . The biggest jump in housing prices happened from 2003 to 2006… . When we entered stage 3 of the boom… and flipping houses became a national obsession. . And it’s not just here in the US. . Something similar happened during the historic boom in Japanese stocks… . With the masses pushing stocks straight up during stage 3… in the 1980s. . This script is so reliable that it goes back centuries… . Just look what happened with shares of the South Sea Company in 1720… . And with the boom in tulip bulbs in Holland during the early 1600s. . Isn’t that incredible? . No matter what asset class… . No matter the geographic location… . And no matter what year the boom happened... . Every single boom throughout history has followed the same script. . It works 100% of the time. . And in each one of those booms, people who knew how to use this script walked away with a fortune. . Those who didn’t... lost all their money . I’m Telling You All This Because This Script Is Playing Out Again RIGHT NOW in the Booming Cryptocurrency Market! . So where are we now in this digital currency boom? . Let me you walk you through the three stages, using Bitcoin as an example… . When Bitcoin “went public” in 2010, very few people understood the opportunity. . Much like the internet in 1994, most people dismissed it as a useless technology. . Only early enthusiasts invested in Bitcoin… . People like Brian Z., from San Francisco. . Back in 2010 he bought about 20,000 Bitcoins… . When the digital currency was trading for just over 15 cents. . Well, that initial investment of $3,000 is now worth as astounding $85.9 million! . He now spends his days traveling the world in ultra-luxurious style… staying exclusively in 5-star suites. He says: . “I have everything I’ve ever dreamed of. I fly all over the world visiting friends, I do whatever I want with my time and I never have to worry about money for the rest of my life.” . Imagine if that happened to you! . That could be your reality a few months from now… . But only if you invest in the right smaller cryptocurrencies… the ones that are still cheap. . Because the truth is… the big money in Bitcoin has already been made by early enthusiasts. . That was stage 1 of the boom. . We’ve moved into stage 2 around 2014... . When institutional investors, aka “the smart money,” started investing in Bitcoin. . Let me show you how… . The Smart Money is Going All In . What started in 2014 has only intensified this year. . You see, the “smart money” is not just looking at Bitcoin anymore. . With hundreds of cryptocurrencies exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%... . They’re now investing in these smaller, lesser-known digital currencies. . Forbes even published the following headline recently… . And went on to say: . “Given how many new crypto millionaires have been minted… old hands in finance who&nbsp;want in on this new world of value are launching funds.” . Aside from these 15 new hedge funds… . There are 70 more in the pipeline! . Once all these 70 funds get set up, billions in new capital will flow into these cryptocurrencies… . Helping push them even higher. . Ronni Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, explains this gold rush: . “The floodgates are opening. I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars.” . And get this… . Fidelity, which has $6.2 trillion in assets under management, has just partnered with Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange. . Imagine what will happen if some of those trillions start moving into cryptos! . Simply put, institutional investors are jumping in with both feet. This is all part of stage 2 of my script. . And to Prove My Point, Here’s an “Inside Scoop”… . Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital are two of the most highly respected venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. . That’s because they tend to see major technology trends before anyone else. . They’ve made billions by investing very early in social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. . Simply put, when these guys invest in something new, you should pay close attention. . Well, Forbes has just reported that they’re “secretly” investing in a cryptocurrency fund called MetaStable. . And I knew that way before the media reported on it. How? . Because I’m good friends with one of the founders of the fund. . You see, in the last 30 years I’ve built connections that go from the head of Google X (Google’s experimental laboratory)… . To Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook… . To billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and “Shark Tank” TV show star. . I’m also connected with just about every big hedge fund manager in Manhattan… . And every major venture capital firm on both the East Coast and in Silicon Valley. . I can see behind the scenes that the “smart money” is now getting heavily involved in cryptocurrencies. . My billionaire friend Mark Cuban is investing in it... Google is in it… and so is billionaire Richard Branson. . With All This Money Flowing In, It’s No Wonder Many Cryptocurrencies are Exploding this Year . Remember when I said you could turn $100 into a retirement fortune? . Look what happened with a little-known cryptocurrency called NEM. . It has jumped as high as 291,142% in the last couple of years. . That’s enough to turn a single $100 bill into $291,242. . That’s more than three times what the average retiree has in their retirement account. . Amazing, right? . Imagine adding almost $300,000 to your nest egg… . Starting with just $100… in just a couple of years! . That’s the power of these smaller cryptocurrencies. . Or look what happened with another digital currency called Ethereum… . Had you put in just $500… . It would have ballooned into a retirement fortune of as much as $407,822… in just a couple of years. . And if you invested a little more, you could’ve literally walked away with millions. . For example, a $5,000 investment in another cryptocurrency called SibCoin… . Could have paid you a $2.8 million fortune… in a matter of months. . Isn’t that incredible? . No wonder the “smart money” wants a piece of the pie. . Look, I recently had lunch with several hedge fund managers and other “Wall Streeters” in New York… . And they were all asking me about cryptocurrencies. . They want to know how to get involved… . Because they know we’ll NEVER see a boom like this again. . But While the “Smart Money” is Going All In… Everyday Folks Are Totally in the Dark . If you don’t know anything about cryptocurrencies, don’t worry. . You are NOT alone. . Despite the massive investments from “the smart money”… . Despite all the newly minted millionaires… . And despite this exploding market… . Most people don’t even know what a cryptocurrency is. . To this date, less than one in ten thousand people has invested in Bitcoin. . Just ask your friends, spouse and neighbors what they think of Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero. . I bet they’ll have no clue what you’re talking about. . That’s because the masses are NOT participating in this boom. . Not yet! . Professor Panos M., Chair of the Department of Economics at Long Island University in New York, agrees with me. . He said we’re still missing “a broad participation beyond the ‘pioneers’ and the ‘early adopters.’” . And that’s the key to my 3-step script. . Remember, the biggest gains in any bull market throughout history only happen when the public joins the trend. . It’s the masses that will push cryptocurrencies to the moon. . And That’s Exactly What’s Set to Happen on January 31 . You see, with cryptocurrencies minting new millionaires seemly everyday… . This epic boom is starting to grab some headlines. . Take a look… . With cryptocurrencies gaining publicity… . The masses will NOT remain on the sideline for much longer. . In fact, I want you to mark January 31 on your calendar… . Because this Single Event is About to Catapult Cryptocurrencies into the Third and Most Explosive Stage of the Boom . Simply put, this event will trigger a buying frenzy… . And help mint a new round of crypto millionaires. . You see, big tech companies like Microsoft and Overstockare already accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. . But what would happen if the world’s largest online retailer started doing the same? . We’re about to find out… . Because with the popularity of Bitcoin exploding… . With people like Bill Gates saying cryptocurrencies are “the future of money”… . And with big economies like Japan legalizing Bitcoin as a form of payment… . I am certain that Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin. . They have no choice. And this will be the tipping point that will create massive generational wealth unlike we’ve ever seen before. . Of course only Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos knows for sure the exact date this will happen… . But given the company&#39;s history of staying ahead of its retail rivals… . Amazon could make the announcement as early as January 31, 2019 at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call. . Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW. . You see, eBay, Amazon’s biggest competitor, has already expressed interest in accepting Bitcoin payment. . And according to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Amazon will soon have no choice but to start accepting Bitcoins. He said: . “They have to follow suit. I’ll be stunned if they don’t, because they can’t just cede that part of the market to us, if we’re the only main, large retail site taking Bitcoin.” . Look, Amazon Web Services has already been working with Digital Currency Group, one of the biggest investors in the cryptocurrency technology. . And Amazon executive Scott Mullins has confirmed it… . Amazon is “working with financial institutions and [crypto experts] to spur innovation and facilitate frictionless experimentation.” . According to my research, they could make the announcement by January 31. . Once that happens, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. . We’ll see a buying frenzy like never before. . It&#39;ll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best Buy. . Only those who get in early will get a good deal. . Most people will be left out. . That’s why I urge you to get in right now… . Get ahead of the crowd… . Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies straight up. . Like I showed you today, every boom follows this 3-step script… . First, only early adopters bought Bitcoin. . Then, the smart money started joining the party. . And now we’re about to enter the third and most explosive stage of the boom in cryptocurrencies. . If you get in before January 31… . You will have a rare chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune. . After that date, this window of opportunity will be slammed shut forever. . You’ll never see an opportunity like this again… not in your lifetime. . But DO NOT Rush to Buy Every Cryptocurrency Out There! . You see, right now there are 840 cryptocurrencies available. . And if you blindly buy any of those… . There’s a 95% chance you’ll lose all your money. . That’s because 95% of them are worthless… and will eventually go to zero. . Here’s the truth you won’t hear anywhere else… . Many of these digital currencies don’t have the technology necessary to make them a viable form of money… . Some can be printed willy-nilly… . Others can be easily hacked… . And others are simply a scam. . How do I know that? . Because aside from being a computer coder myself… . I know other computer hackers who have looked into the codes of these currencies. . For example, one of my contacts analyzed the cryptocurrency The DAO… and discovered it was very susceptible to hacking. . I stayed away from that specific digital currency. . Sure enough, it was hacked… and investors lost millions. . Look, I’ll be the first to concede that most of these tiny cryptocurrencies are risky speculations… . But if you’re avoiding ALL cryptocurrencies, well… . You’re costing yourself tens of thousands... even millions of dollars! . Because the truth is… . Cryptocurrencies Are Here to Stay! . They’re doing to money what the internet did to mail. . It’s the future of money. . Saying cryptocurrencies are going away, it’s like saying the internet is going away. . It’s not going to happen. . But you’ll only make money if you buy the RIGHT cryptocurrencies! . Remember what happened during the 1990s tech boom? . A lot of people made a fortune during the boom. . I personally made $15 million in 1998 alone. . And those who invested in enduring companies like Amazon, Google and eBay got very, very rich. . At the same time, scores of foolish day traders and IPO junkies got crushed… . Because they invested in the wrong tech companies… . Companies that were worthless garbage. . That history is repeating itself right now in the cryptocurrency space. . Only a handful of these digital currencies can really help you make money… . And I want to show you which ones. . Everything You Need to Know is Inside this FREE Package . To help you get started, I’d like to send you this FREE package… . Which includes my brand-new book and an exclusive 6-video series Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies. . This package is NOT available on Amazon or anywhere else. . But I’ve reserved a free unit for you today. . Inside the book Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies, you’ll discover… . ***The #1 cryptocurrency to buy right now. (No, it’s not Bitcoin.) . It’s already up 3,432% this year alone. . But that’s just the beginning. With Fortune 500 companies, like JP Morgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft, investing in this currency… the potential here is really explosive. . Even better… it’s trading for a fraction of Bitcoin’s price. . But it won’t remain cheap for long. See the details on page 37. . ***The #1 mistake cryptocurrency investors are making right now. . This could be the most important part of the book. . Because a lot of people who are making this mistake will get wiped out. But you will NOT be one of them. (See page 43.) . ***The computer geek secret to make sure your crypto account will NEVER be hacked. . Hint: You can do this even if you know nothing about computers. See page 25. . ***The 3-step screening process my team of venture capitalists used to pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months. . With these 3 simple steps, you’ll be able to tell which cryptocurrencies are legit… and which ones are a scam. . If a currency does not check all these 3 boxes, forget about it. (Page 50.) . ***How to invest in the booming cryptocurrency industry directly from your retirement account. . With this secret, you will not need to fill out extra paperwork… or open an account with a digital currency broker. . You can even use your IRA. Simply follow my instructions on page 61. . And much, much more… . You’ll find everything you need to get started inside this FREE book… . From the philosophy behind digital currencies… to opening an account… to finding the right currencies to buy. . And don’t worry, investing in cryptocurrencies is so easy a kid can do it… . Just look at Erik F., a 12-year-old kid from Idaho. . He started with a small investment of $1,000 in Bitcoin… . And was able to turn that into a $1.2 million fortune. . If he can do it, anyone can! . And to make your life even easier… . This Package Also Includes A Never-Before-Released 6-Video Series Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies . You see, rather than just leaving you with a book… . I wanted to walk you step by step through the entire process... on camera. . So here’s what I did… . I used my contacts in New York to select four people who knew nothing about cryptocurrencies. . I put them in a room with me… and got the cameras rolling. . These are everyday folks just like you… . People who want to make a fortune from cryptocurrencies… . But don’t know how to get started. . I wanted to prove to you that anyone can do this. . I’ve recorded everything and I’d like to send you this 6-video masterclass for FREE. . I’ll personally “hold your hand” and teach you everything I know about how to make money from cryptos. . In a moment, I’ll show you how you can access everything. . First, you might be wondering why I’d go through all this work… . Why not just keep this information to myself and make a fortune? . To answer that, let me tell you a very personal story that explains everything… . How My Bank Account Balance Went from $15 Million to Just $143 . As I mentioned, I’m already profiting from cryptocurrencies… . And my team of venture capitalists even banked $1.8 million recently. . But life has not always been this “easy” for me. . You see, a few years ago I lost my entire life savings. . Back in 1998, I made $15 million when I sold my first company, called Reset. . But I was young and stupid. . And within three and a half years, I went from millionaire to having just $143 left in my bank account. . Let me tell you… . It’s not a good feeling when you have no clue how you’ll pay your mortgage… or your children’s education. . I was so broke and depressed that suicide crossed my mind. . I thought maybe my two little girls would be better off with the $4 million payout from my life insurance policy. . But then I recovered… got my act straight… and launched new, successful businesses. . And here I am… . Today I’m doing everything I can to make sure my kids and grandkids will NEVER go through the financial nightmare I went through. . And I don’t want YOU to go through that either. . Today you have a once-in-a-generation chance to secure a comfortable retirement… once and for all. . I sincerely believe those who take the right steps today could make a killing from cryptocurrencies. . A year from now, you could be traveling around the world… . Spending time in your new luxury home in the south of France… . Or simply drinking a cocktail with your loved ones in some exotic beach… . With the peace of mind that only comes when you KNOW you’ll never have to worry about money again. . I’m talking about making enough to fund your entire retirement… . And still leave money for your kids and grandkids. . You Can Get Started Today with this FREE Cryptocurrency Package. Here’s How to Claim It .

First, I’d like to make this deal even sweeter by adding three special gifts for you… . Bonus Report #1: The 48X Back-Door Way to the Cryptocurrency Market . During the famous California gold rush, those who mined gold made a fortune. . But they were not the only ones. . Those who provided the miners with picks, shovels and other equipment needed for gold mining also walked away with fortunes. . The same thing will happen with the crypto rush. . I found a handful of public companies that are involved in the sector. . And you could easily beat the market with them… and make 5, 10 and even 20 times your money in the coming years. . For example, take my cryptocurrency stock #1… . This company produces the chips that are essential for the cryptocurrency industry to function. . No wonder the stock has already jumped 771% in the last couple of years… . In a time when the stock market went up just 16%! . That means you could have made 48 times MORE money than the overall market… just in the last couple of years. . And that’s just from one stock. . I’ve identified two other opportunities… one in the retail space… and one in the cybersecurity space. . And inside this report you’ll get all the details on all three stocks… .

I tend to hear about investment ideas BEFORE they become popular. . And that’s how you make BIG money… by getting in before the crowd. . This is exactly how I’ve made some great gains in recent years, including… . 6,000% on an early investment in Buddy Media (a social media platform now owned by Salesforce)... . 2,600% on an early investment in Ticketfly (a competitor to Ticketmaster, which lets you purchase tickets to events online)... . 1,200% in a little-known cloud computing firm... . But that’s the past… . Looking ahead, I’m now focusing on the seven newest and most important big trends in America today. . And for each trend, I’ve already identified the best way to play it in the stock market. .

With dozens of digital currencies exploding as high as 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%... . Historians will call today’s cryptocurrency market the biggest BOOM ever! . And if you’re missing out… . You could be cheating yourself out of the only chance you’ll EVER have… . To turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune… in a matter of months. . And it couldn’t be easier. . Even if you know nothing about cryptocurrencies… . All you have to do is follow my simple, 3-step script you see below. . Because every single BOOM throughout history has followed this script. . The stock market boom in the roaring ’20s… . The tech boom in the 1990s… . The housing boom in the 2000s… . And now the booming cryptocurrency market is following this exact same 3-step script. . Using this roadmap, I already made an investment that returned a total profit of $1.8 million… . From one single cryptocurrency trade! . And before you guess, it was not Bitcoin… the “granddaddy” of all cryptocurrencies. . You see, Bitcoin gained a lot of publicity after it turned many regular folks into millionaires. . As The Economist magazine says... . “Anyone clever or lucky enough to have bought $1,000 of Bitcoins in July 2010, when the price stood at $0.05, would now have a stash worth $46 million.” . The thing is… . The fast money in Bitcoin has already been made. . It was easy to make a quick fortune when Bitcoin was trading for pennies. . But now that the digital currency is trading around $4,000… . It will be harder for you to make millions from Bitcoin going forward. . But if you missed the Bitcoin boom, don’t worry… . Because this year hundreds of smaller cryptocurrencies have popped up. . And unlike the “expensive” Bitcoin… . Many of These Lesser-Known Digital Currencies Are Trading for Pennies! . In fact, I recently bought another cryptocurrency for just 52 cents! . And it’s already up 800%... in just three weeks! . Many other cryptos are trading for pocket change. . That means you could get started with a single $100 bill… . And if you follow my proven 3-step script… . You could cash out with a retirement fortune just a few months from now… . Just like what happened with early Bitcoin investors. . I know that’s a huge claim… . But this kind of get-rich-quick opportunity is ALREADY happening. . Look what happened with Verge, a new cryptocurrency that improved upon Bitcoin’s privacy technology. . Most people have never heard of it… . But had you invested a single $100 bill earlier this year… . You could have cashed out with $57,236… . In a little more than two months. . Isn’t that incredible? . In my entire 30+ year career on Wall Street… . I’ve never seen any other investment that could make as much as 572 times your money… in just a couple of months. . And Verge is not the only cryptocurrency that’s booming. . Look what happened with DigiByte, a digital currency designed to protect its users against cyber threats. . Just a few months ago, you could have bought it for pennies! . And had you put in $100 earlier this year… . It would have ballooned to as much as $30,628. . Again, this explosion happened in a matter of months. . And you can make even more money if you’re a little more ambitious. . The more you put in… the higher your gains. . In the case of DigiByte, for example… . You could have turned a $2,000 investment into a $612,578 retirement fortune. . Most people can’t make that kind of money in their lifetime. . And yet, you could have done it in just a couple of months earlier this year. . Amazing, right? . Something similar happened with another cryptocurrency called Nexus… . Had you invested $100 when it was trading for pennies… . You could have walked away with $66,666! . Invest a little more, say, $2,000… . And you’d be looking at an incredible payout of more than $1.3 million. . Imagine… . You, a certified millionaire in a matter of months… from one single trade. . Do you see now why historians will call this the biggest financial boom ever? . And here’s the thing… . As incredible as these gains are… . That’s just a small taste of what’s coming in the next 12 months. . How do I know that? . Because so far cryptocurrencies are following a script that has been proven over, over and over again… . Throughout every single financial boom in history. . And according to this script… . We’re on the Verge of a Massive Buying Frenzy… Starting With a Single Event on January 31 . Even though one of my investments already returned $1.8 million from a single cryptocurrency trade… . I expect to make much more in the coming months… . Especially after January 31. . That’s when a single event is set to send cryptocurrencies into an epic parabolic move. . I’ll give you more details in just a moment. . But what you need to know right now is that I’m not just making some sort of far-fetched guess. . This is all part of my 3-step script I’ve been telling you about. . And while most people don’t know how to use this simple roadmap… . Every single boom in history has followed this script… . With no exception! . Simply put, if you follow this script… . You’ll have a chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune in the coming months… . All while minimizing your risk. . That’s the good news. . Now, here’s the bad news… . Like every single boom in history, this cryptocurrency bonanza won’t last forever. . In fact, it could be all over by next year. . And when it’s over, you’ll NEVER see a get-rich-quick opportunity like this again… . Not in your lifetime. . What does that mean for you? . It means today you have a very small window of opportunity to act… . One that’s closing with each passing day. In fact… . Every Day You Wait, Someone Else is Growing Rich from Cryptocurrencies . Just take a look at the recent gains from some of these digital currencies… . These are NOT annual gains. . These are NOT monthly gains. . These are gains that happened in a 24-hour period! . Some of these cryptocurrencies are jumping 28%... 49%... and even 90%... . In a SINGLE DAY! . Look at your retirement statement right now… . I have no idea what you’re doing with your money… . But I guarantee you’re NOT making these types of daily gains. . These gains are unheard of! . It’s why historians will call this the biggest BOOM ever! . And if you miss it… . I guarantee you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. . That’s why I’m writing this urgent message… . To show you how to use my proven 3-step script… . The same script that helped my team of venture capitalists pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months. . But Before I Give You All the Details I Should Probably Introduce Myself . Hi, I’m James Altucher. . If my name sounds familiar, maybe you’ve read one of my 18 books, including best-sellers The Power of No and Choose Yourself… . Maybe you’ve read some of my articles published in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The New York Observer… . Or listened to my podcast “The James Altucher Show,” which has more than 20 million downloads. . If you look me up online, you’ll see that the popular website Wikipedia describes me as… . “A hedge fund manager, entrepreneur, best-selling author, venture capitalist and podcaster who has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies.” . I guess they forgot to mention I’m also a computer nerd. . I wrote my first computer program in 1982 on an Apple II+… . And I’ve been a coder and hacker for the past 35 years! . I’m telling you this because when it comes to cryptocurrencies… . That’s a BIG deal. . You see, these digital currencies are created by computer programmers. . That means you can only fully understand them if you can read the code behind each currency. . And that’s my bread and butter. . I even know many of the computer geeks who are actually developing these currencies. . And thanks to my nerdy background, I’ve been neck deep in cryptocurrencies since 2013. . In fact, that same year I created what was probably the first Bitcoin online “store”… . Where I presold my book Choose Yourself exclusively on Bitcoin. . At the time, CNBC even invited me to talk about it on live TV. . The anchor was totally skeptical of Bitcoin. . He insinuated I didn’t really care about cryptocurrencies… and was just pulling a marketing stunt. . You can see my shocking response in the 30-second clip below… . While I was telling everyone Bitcoin would succeed… . The mainstream media was saying the exact opposite. . A contributor for Business Insider called Bitcoin “something strange.” And they questioned “why anyone would think it’s useful.” . A CNN op-ed said it was “a big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators”… and “a bubble that could soon pop.” . And Slate published an article with the headline “Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme — the internet’s favorite currency will collapse.” . So if you missed the Bitcoin boom, it’s not your fault. . The mainstream media simply “brainwashed” most Americans into thinking Bitcoin was a scam. . Well, had you ignored the clueless mainstream media… . And listened to what I said on CNBC instead… . You would be up 3,710% today. . That’s more than 38 times your money in the last four years… . Enough to turn a small retirement account of 10 grand into a $381,044 retirement fortune! . I’m telling you this because I want you to realize that the mainstream media is clueless when it comes to new technologies. . Case in point… . Let Me Show You One More Example Where I Was Actually Mocked on Live TV . In 2007, shortly after Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion… . I went on CNBC and predicted the company would be worth at least $100 billion. . They thought I was crazy. And I was actually mocked on live TV. . You can see the short 30-second clip below. (It&#39;s quite entertaining.) . Today, Facebook is worth more than $400 billion… . And had you bought shares 5 years ago, you’d be up 870%! . A few years after I made my Facebook prediction, CNBC published this headline… admitting I was right! . Bottom line… . Don’t expect the mainstream media to show you how to make a fortune from new tech trends, including digital currencies. . Because they’re always late to the party. . Without my 3-step script, they’re totally lost. . Not to mention that there’s a lot of misinformation out of there… . Some of my followers are getting scammed into investing in the wrong cryptocurrencies. . That’s why I’ve made it my mission to reveal the TRUTH about making money in this booming market. . It’s time for me to set the record straight. . So please pay close attention… . Because in the next few minutes, I will show you how to use the same script my team of venture capitalists used to bank $1.8 million in a matter of months. . I’ll show you what I’m doing with my own money… my family’s fortune… the money I plan to leave to my kids and grandkids. . Then you can decide for yourself if this is right for you. . But the truth is… . Dozens of Cryptocurrencies Are Exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and Even 81,465%... in a Matter of Months . Take a look… . The few people who understand what’s going on are already making a life-changing fortune. . People like Alan A., a 47-year-old San Franciscan. . Less than a year ago, he bought three digital currencies…. Ether, Golem and Gnosis. . Within six months, he turned his $8,500 initial investment into $7.5 million! . That’s a return of 88,000%... in a matter of months! . Incredible, right? . Sean I. from New York scored big wins in cryptocurrencies like Game, Litecoin, Ripple and Dogecoin. . And he was able to turn his initial stake of $15,000 into a $3 million fortune… . In less than two years. . After becoming a crypto millionaire, he said: . “Anybody right now with half a mind and at least four fingers can click some buttons and get in on this inevitable exponential rise in crypto and make an INSANE amount of money.” . As amazing as these gains are… . That’s just the beginning… . A small taste of what’s coming. . Because on January 31, there’s a single event taking place at precisely 4 p.m. . And it could trigger a mad rush into cryptocurrencies. . If you take a position right now… . In the right cryptos (I’ll show you which ones)… . You could turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune in the next 12 months. . And don’t worry if you’ve never invested in cryptocurrencies before… . Even if you have no clue what a digital currency is… . You could still walk away with a life-changing fortune… . Because I’ve put together an exclusive beginner’s guide package just for you. . And I’d Like to Send You This Cryptocurrency Package… FREE of Charge . It includes my brand-new book called Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies (not available on Amazon or anywhere else)… . And… . A never-before-released 6-video series Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies, where I’ll walk you step by step through the entire process. . As far as I know, there’s nothing like this out there. . I could probably charge hundreds of dollars for this package. . But for reasons that will become clear soon, I want you to have it for FREE. . I’ll show you how to claim it in just a moment. . First, let me show you how this cryptocurrency script works… . Getting Rich from Cryptocurrencies Could be as Easy as 1-2-3 . The boom in cryptocurrencies is following the same script that has played out over, over and over again. . You see, every boom follows a sequence of three stages… . First, only early enthusiasts are courageous enough to invest in the new trend. . That’s stage 1. . Then, institutional investors (the so-called “smart money”) jump in. . That’s stage 2. . Finally, the public joins the party, triggering a massive explosion in price. . That’s stage 3. . If you know how to use this roadmap, you could make an absolute fortune. . And to help you understand how this 1-2-3 sequence works… . Let me show you what happened during the 1990s boom in tech stocks. . In the mid-1990s, most people didn’t even know what the internet was. . In 1994, the morning show NBC&#39;s Today had a segment where one of the anchors asked, “What is the internet, anyway?” . While most people were dismissing the technology as a fad... . Early adopters like myself were heavily investing in it. . In 1995, I correctly predicted every company would need a website. So I started my first internet company to help big corporations get online. . That’s how I ended up building the first websites for American Express, HBO, Sony and Disney, among others. . That was stage 1 of the boom! . Only when Netscape went public in late 1995 did people outside Silicon Valley start taking the internet seriously. . That’s when institutional investors started joining the party… . With pension funds and venture capitalists making a fortune when companies like Yahoo and Amazon went public. . The additional flow of money from the “smart money” helped pushed tech stocks even higher. . That was stage 2 of the boom. . But the public was still not participating. . In June 1998, for example, mainstream economist Paul Krugman predicted the internet’s impact on the economy would be no greater than the fax machine. . It wasn’t until 1999 that the masses finally started to invest heavily in tech stocks… . With more people jumping into the market… . Tech stocks jumped even higher… . Attracting more and more people wanting to get a piece of the action. . And that was the third and most explosive stage of the boom… . With the Nasdaq soaring more than 85% in 1999 alone. . I’m telling you this because my research shows that cryptocurrencies are following this exact same script… . First, early enthusiasts… . Then, institutional investors… . And finally the public. . So keep this sequence in mind… . Because in just a moment, I’ll show you how you can use this simple script to turn $100 into a retirement fortune… in the next 12 months. . There’s no need to risk your hard-earned money trying to guess when these currencies will move… . Because Every Single Boom in History Has Followed this Script . The so-called roaring ’20s followed this same roadmap… . First, only early enthusiasts invested in the new technologies of the time, such as radio, the car and easy access to electric power. . Then in 1924 institutional investors jumped in… . Finally, in the late 1920s the news started reporting stories of overnight fortunes. . And regular folks started to wonder: Why not me? . They started borrowing money just to buy stocks. The result? . Stocks went straight up. In 1928 alone, the stock market doubled. . And it’s not just stock booms that follow this 3-step script, either. The US housing boom also followed this roadmap… . Take a look… . The biggest jump in housing prices happened from 2003 to 2006… . When we entered stage 3 of the boom… and flipping houses became a national obsession. . And it’s not just here in the US. . Something similar happened during the historic boom in Japanese stocks… . With the masses pushing stocks straight up during stage 3… in the 1980s. . This script is so reliable that it goes back centuries… . Just look what happened with shares of the South Sea Company in 1720… . And with the boom in tulip bulbs in Holland during the early 1600s. . Isn’t that incredible? . No matter what asset class… . No matter the geographic location… . And no matter what year the boom happened... . Every single boom throughout history has followed the same script. . It works 100% of the time. . And in each one of those booms, people who knew how to use this script walked away with a fortune. . Those who didn’t... lost all their money . I’m Telling You All This Because This Script Is Playing Out Again RIGHT NOW in the Booming Cryptocurrency Market! . So where are we now in this digital currency boom? . Let me you walk you through the three stages, using Bitcoin as an example… . When Bitcoin “went public” in 2010, very few people understood the opportunity. . Much like the internet in 1994, most people dismissed it as a useless technology. . Only early enthusiasts invested in Bitcoin… . People like Brian Z., from San Francisco. . Back in 2010 he bought about 20,000 Bitcoins… . When the digital currency was trading for just over 15 cents. . Well, that initial investment of $3,000 is now worth as astounding $85.9 million! . He now spends his days traveling the world in ultra-luxurious style… staying exclusively in 5-star suites. He says: . “I have everything I’ve ever dreamed of. I fly all over the world visiting friends, I do whatever I want with my time and I never have to worry about money for the rest of my life.” . Imagine if that happened to you! . That could be your reality a few months from now… . But only if you invest in the right smaller cryptocurrencies… the ones that are still cheap. . Because the truth is… the big money in Bitcoin has already been made by early enthusiasts. . That was stage 1 of the boom. . We’ve moved into stage 2 around 2014... . When institutional investors, aka “the smart money,” started investing in Bitcoin. . Let me show you how… . The Smart Money is Going All In . What started in 2014 has only intensified this year. . You see, the “smart money” is not just looking at Bitcoin anymore. . With hundreds of cryptocurrencies exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%... . They’re now investing in these smaller, lesser-known digital currencies. . Forbes even published the following headline recently… . And went on to say: . “Given how many new crypto millionaires have been minted… old hands in finance who&nbsp;want in on this new world of value are launching funds.” . Aside from these 15 new hedge funds… . There are 70 more in the pipeline! . Once all these 70 funds get set up, billions in new capital will flow into these cryptocurrencies… . Helping push them even higher. . Ronni Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, explains this gold rush: . “The floodgates are opening. I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars.” . And get this… . Fidelity, which has $6.2 trillion in assets under management, has just partnered with Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange. . Imagine what will happen if some of those trillions start moving into cryptos! . Simply put, institutional investors are jumping in with both feet. This is all part of stage 2 of my script. . And to Prove My Point, Here’s an “Inside Scoop”… . Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital are two of the most highly respected venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. . That’s because they tend to see major technology trends before anyone else. . They’ve made billions by investing very early in social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. . Simply put, when these guys invest in something new, you should pay close attention. . Well, Forbes has just reported that they’re “secretly” investing in a cryptocurrency fund called MetaStable. . And I knew that way before the media reported on it. How? . Because I’m good friends with one of the founders of the fund. . You see, in the last 30 years I’ve built connections that go from the head of Google X (Google’s experimental laboratory)… . To Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook… . To billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and “Shark Tank” TV show star. . I’m also connected with just about every big hedge fund manager in Manhattan… . And every major venture capital firm on both the East Coast and in Silicon Valley. . I can see behind the scenes that the “smart money” is now getting heavily involved in cryptocurrencies. . My billionaire friend Mark Cuban is investing in it... Google is in it… and so is billionaire Richard Branson. . With All This Money Flowing In, It’s No Wonder Many Cryptocurrencies are Exploding this Year . Remember when I said you could turn $100 into a retirement fortune? . Look what happened with a little-known cryptocurrency called NEM. . It has jumped as high as 291,142% in the last couple of years. . That’s enough to turn a single $100 bill into $291,242. . That’s more than three times what the average retiree has in their retirement account. . Amazing, right? . Imagine adding almost $300,000 to your nest egg… . Starting with just $100… in just a couple of years! . That’s the power of these smaller cryptocurrencies. . Or look what happened with another digital currency called Ethereum… . Had you put in just $500… . It would have ballooned into a retirement fortune of as much as $407,822… in just a couple of years. . And if you invested a little more, you could’ve literally walked away with millions. . For example, a $5,000 investment in another cryptocurrency called SibCoin… . Could have paid you a $2.8 million fortune… in a matter of months. . Isn’t that incredible? . No wonder the “smart money” wants a piece of the pie. . Look, I recently had lunch with several hedge fund managers and other “Wall Streeters” in New York… . And they were all asking me about cryptocurrencies. . They want to know how to get involved… . Because they know we’ll NEVER see a boom like this again. . But While the “Smart Money” is Going All In… Everyday Folks Are Totally in the Dark . If you don’t know anything about cryptocurrencies, don’t worry. . You are NOT alone. . Despite the massive investments from “the smart money”… . Despite all the newly minted millionaires… . And despite this exploding market… . Most people don’t even know what a cryptocurrency is. . To this date, less than one in ten thousand people has invested in Bitcoin. . Just ask your friends, spouse and neighbors what they think of Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero. . I bet they’ll have no clue what you’re talking about. . That’s because the masses are NOT participating in this boom. . Not yet! . Professor Panos M., Chair of the Department of Economics at Long Island University in New York, agrees with me. . He said we’re still missing “a broad participation beyond the ‘pioneers’ and the ‘early adopters.’” . And that’s the key to my 3-step script. . Remember, the biggest gains in any bull market throughout history only happen when the public joins the trend. . It’s the masses that will push cryptocurrencies to the moon. . And That’s Exactly What’s Set to Happen on January 31 . You see, with cryptocurrencies minting new millionaires seemly everyday… . This epic boom is starting to grab some headlines. . Take a look… . With cryptocurrencies gaining publicity… . The masses will NOT remain on the sideline for much longer. . In fact, I want you to mark January 31 on your calendar… . Because this Single Event is About to Catapult Cryptocurrencies into the Third and Most Explosive Stage of the Boom . Simply put, this event will trigger a buying frenzy… . And help mint a new round of crypto millionaires. . You see, big tech companies like Microsoft and Overstockare already accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. . But what would happen if the world’s largest online retailer started doing the same? . We’re about to find out… . Because with the popularity of Bitcoin exploding… . With people like Bill Gates saying cryptocurrencies are “the future of money”… . And with big economies like Japan legalizing Bitcoin as a form of payment… . I am certain that Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin. . They have no choice. And this will be the tipping point that will create massive generational wealth unlike we’ve ever seen before. . Of course only Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos knows for sure the exact date this will happen… . But given the company&#39;s history of staying ahead of its retail rivals… . Amazon could make the announcement as early as January 31, 2019 at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call. . Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW. . You see, eBay, Amazon’s biggest competitor, has already expressed interest in accepting Bitcoin payment. . And according to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Amazon will soon have no choice but to start accepting Bitcoins. He said: . “They have to follow suit. I’ll be stunned if they don’t, because they can’t just cede that part of the market to us, if we’re the only main, large retail site taking Bitcoin.” . Look, Amazon Web Services has already been working with Digital Currency Group, one of the biggest investors in the cryptocurrency technology. . And Amazon executive Scott Mullins has confirmed it… . Amazon is “working with financial institutions and [crypto experts] to spur innovation and facilitate frictionless experimentation.” . According to my research, they could make the announcement by January 31. . Once that happens, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. . We’ll see a buying frenzy like never before. . It&#39;ll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best Buy. . Only those who get in early will get a good deal. . Most people will be left out. . That’s why I urge you to get in right now… . Get ahead of the crowd… . Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies straight up. . Like I showed you today, every boom follows this 3-step script… . First, only early adopters bought Bitcoin. . Then, the smart money started joining the party. . And now we’re about to enter the third and most explosive stage of the boom in cryptocurrencies. . If you get in before January 31… . You will have a rare chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune. . After that date, this window of opportunity will be slammed shut forever. . You’ll never see an opportunity like this again… not in your lifetime. . But DO NOT Rush to Buy Every Cryptocurrency Out There! . You see, right now there are 840 cryptocurrencies available. . And if you blindly buy any of those… . There’s a 95% chance you’ll lose all your money. . That’s because 95% of them are worthless… and will eventually go to zero. . Here’s the truth you won’t hear anywhere else… . Many of these digital currencies don’t have the technology necessary to make them a viable form of money… . Some can be printed willy-nilly… . Others can be easily hacked… . And others are simply a scam. . How do I know that? . Because aside from being a computer coder myself… . I know other computer hackers who have looked into the codes of these currencies. . For example, one of my contacts analyzed the cryptocurrency The DAO… and discovered it was very susceptible to hacking. . I stayed away from that specific digital currency. . Sure enough, it was hacked… and investors lost millions. . Look, I’ll be the first to concede that most of these tiny cryptocurrencies are risky speculations… . But if you’re avoiding ALL cryptocurrencies, well… . You’re costing yourself tens of thousands... even millions of dollars! . Because the truth is… . Cryptocurrencies Are Here to Stay! . They’re doing to money what the internet did to mail. . It’s the future of money. . Saying cryptocurrencies are going away, it’s like saying the internet is going away. . It’s not going to happen. . But you’ll only make money if you buy the RIGHT cryptocurrencies! . Remember what happened during the 1990s tech boom? . A lot of people made a fortune during the boom. . I personally made $15 million in 1998 alone. . And those who invested in enduring companies like Amazon, Google and eBay got very, very rich. . At the same time, scores of foolish day traders and IPO junkies got crushed… . Because they invested in the wrong tech companies… . Companies that were worthless garbage. . That history is repeating itself right now in the cryptocurrency space. . Only a handful of these digital currencies can really help you make money… . And I want to show you which ones. . Everything You Need to Know is Inside this FREE Package . To help you get started, I’d like to send you this FREE package… .

As I mentioned, I’m already profiting from cryptocurrencies… . And my team of venture capitalists even banked $1.8 million recently. . But life has not always been this “easy” for me. . You see, a few years ago I lost my entire life savings. . Back in 1998, I made $15 million when I sold my first company, called Reset. . But I was young and stupid. . And within three and a half years, I went from millionaire to having just $143 left in my bank account. . Let me tell you… . It’s not a good feeling when you have no clue how you’ll pay your mortgage… or your children’s education. . I was so broke and depressed that suicide crossed my mind. .

    "title": "Agency Ad",
    "content": "Bencivenga - Ad-Agency - IOWAN - W01 . Advertisment . Announcing a direct response advertising agency that will guarantee to outpull your best ad. . If you are a direct response advertiser, here is a no-risk offer from Calas, Powell, Rosenthal &amp; Block... . We’ll guarantee to outpull your best ad by at least 10% in a split run test. . If we don’t pull at least 10% more responses, you won’t owe us a penny for any work we’ve done—creative or production. We’ll even refund half your media expense, to cover our half of the test. . If we do beat your best ad by at least 10%, you simply pay us an agreed upon creative fee. Should the test results be impressive—and we both wish to enter into a full-service agency agreement—this creative fee will be refunded to you. . In effect, we offer you a risk-free trial of our advertising pulling power. Our work will cost you absolutely nothing—no creative, production or media costs—unless we beat your best ad by at least 10%. . Are There Any Catches? . There are two: . 1. You must be willing to let us create advertising we think will sell. Except for your legal and factual approval, we’d retain creative freedom. Naturally, if an ad isn’t ours—if the copy has been rewritten or the layout redesigned—we can’t guarantee it’s success. . 2. You must need better advertising. If we think your present advertising is excellent, we’ll tell you. We don&#39;t presume to be the only direct response agency that can turn out superlative work. . But if you’re among the vast majority of advertisers who’s ads aren’t living up to their product’s full potential, we’re confident we can help you. And perhaps you’d like to know more about us. . Who Is CPR&amp;B? . CPR&amp;B is a full-service direct response agency in New Rochell, N.Y. We specialize in creating advertising that sells. In the past four years, CPR&amp;B has quietly grown to become one of the ten largest direct response agencies in America. We’ve doubled in size each of the past three years. We’ve now expanded our staff again and can offer guaranteed results to more advertisers. . How Can We Guarantee Results? . We’re willing and able to guarantee results because of our total approach to direct response. To be sure, few of the ideas in this approach are original with us, but the total combination seems to be—and makes for unusually powerful advertising. Here are the key points: . 1. Advertising Is Salesmanship: Our whole creative approach is built on this fundamental premise. Every word, every picture in our advertisements must justify itself in sales. . Of course, most agencies in direct response fully agree with the idea that advertising must sell. But we don’t believe most of them live by it as religiously as we, and would shrink from the thought of guaranteeing their work. . 2. Building on a Strong Product: We believe that great advertising starts with a first class product. Rosser Reeves, former Chairman of Ted Bates, summed it up nicely when he said, “A gifted product is mightier than a gifted pen.” . Once we take on a client with such a product, we research it for weeks. We take it apart and examine it from all angles. We visit the factory or place of business and talk with those who make it. We interview it’s users. We take it home and use it ourselves. . Then we compare it with the competition—until we’ve found it’s unique customer advantage. Once we have this, we build the entire campaign around it, and demonstrate logically, factually, dramatically, why it’s the best product to fill a specific consumer need. . We’ve verified time and again in sales results that a strong product and good advertising are an almost unbeatable combination. . 3. Top Copywriters: We hire the best writers we can find. Our newest, for example, placed first in a field of 53 applicants. Some were well known. Eighteen took our rigorous copy test. . We now have five writers— supported by three full-time researchers—and we’re looking to hire more. We aim to be the Number 1 copy team in direct response. . 4. Copywriter Commission System: Because copywriters are . salesmen, we reward them with commissions. The more their ads sell, the more money they can make, with no limit. If you think this motivates copywriters to work hard and create the best ad they can for you—you’re absolutely right! . 5. A Principal on Your Account: &nbsp;During and after the initial test period, an agency principal will supervise all work on your account, and have day-to-day responsibility for anything done for you. You gain the experience of—and have immediate access to—one of our key people at all times. . 6. Bringing It All Together: Bringing this all together is an esprit de corps that makes work a joy at CPR&amp;B. You’ll find our copywriters working until 7, 8, and 9 o’clock, night after night, brainstorming and trying to smash someone else’s control ad to smithereens.&nbsp; . What we have is a group of people trying to break direct response wide open—and the creative excitement is exhilarating. The president of a major competitor, himself a famous copywriter, confided to us, “I’d join you for the fun of it all—if I were 25 years younger.” . How Have Our Clients Done? . We wish we could say we hit a home run every time, but of course we can’t. But by and large, our clients have done quite well. For example: . A Financial Newsletter: Within two years after our advertising began, their subscription list increased 490%. We prepared a series of renewal letters and their renewal ratio increased 260%. They went from near bankruptcy to become a prosperous 6-figure company. . A Private School for Problem Adolescents: Our first ad went through an agonizing 23 drafts before we let it out of the shop. The copywriter was almost in tears. But once it ran, it turned back an astounding 320% monthly profit to our client. . A Calculator Distributor: Our first ad failed so poorly, we never got a second chance. But we, not our client, took the loss in accordance with our risk-free agreement. . An Economic Bi-Weekly :&nbsp;Our first ad topped all previous ads they . created during 8 years. Our next ad topped that. A sales letter, which cost less than $2,000 to produce, netted better than $71,000 in profits after all fulfillment costs. . A Local Bookstore:&nbsp; We did a “quickie” self-mailer for these friends who tell us they’ve never again had even half the store traffic or sales. . A Guard Service (supplier of uniformed guards): Our first ad for leads outpulled their basic control ad by better than 7 to 1. On a small test budget, we generated more leads than they could effectively handle. . A Commodity Dealer: Our advertising helped play a part in their “cinderella” success story. Four years ago, when we began doing their advertising, their annual sales were $7 million. Sales have since more than doubled every year. Last year, their share of market was probably above 50% and their sales surpassed $400 million. . A Financial Advisory Service: This is a new client, and our advertising is still in early stages. In their two most frequently used media, our advertising has brought in subscribers at 40% below their former average cost. Tests in other media show we may have opened up two entirely new markets. . What Should You Do If You’re Interested? . If you’re interested in us and our unique offer, send us a proof of your bst ad, or sample of your top direct mail package, plus any background literature you may have. We’ll look it over and let you know shortly if we feel we can beat it by at least 10%. On the average, we feel we can beat about 19 out of every 20 advertisements currently in direct response. This may sound brash—but we back up our confidence with our own money. The best part about our “guaranteed results” offer is that you don’t risk a cent. . To take us up on our offer, and for more information, write to: .

How to write a headline that stops your intended audience cold. . Most of your letters... and&nbsp;all&nbsp;of your newspaper and magazine ads... will have a headline. . If you do what most lazy writers do, you&#39;ll slap one together at the last minute, after you&#39;ve written everything else. . And this will&nbsp;murder&nbsp;your ad. . Flip through the nearest magazine. Look at the ads. You&#39;ll see a few with headlines that seem clear enough. Some may even induce you to read the body copy. . But most of them will just float right by your eyes, like seagulls on the horizon. . Your headline is the single most important piece of copy you will write. Savvy copywriters often spend... . 90% Of Their Time Crafting&nbsp;Just&nbsp;The Headline! . Why? Because your headline must do two jobs, and do them&nbsp;quickly.

My clients have found that personalizing letters can increase response by as much as 30%. Even if the personalization only occurs in the salutation (“Dear Bob McDaniels:”). .

If not, they&#39;ll read all about it in the special report. . Trigger words are the&nbsp;next best thing&nbsp;to the sound of your own name.&nbsp;They are shorthand, and very direct, descriptions of the very thing you are interested in. If you&#39;re a rabid bowler, you&#39;ll perk up to the words “Hey, Bowlers!” . If you&#39;re hot to find a new house, you&#39;ll respond to the trigger words “house hunting” and “real estate secrets your broker is hiding from you”. . If your business is hemorrhaging money, you&#39;ll likely respond to the words “cash flow secrets”, “instant flood of new customers” and “Chapter Eleven”. . If you suspect your spouse is cheating on you, you might respond to the words “divorce” and “how to screw your husband or wife out of custody”. . Readers&nbsp;depend&nbsp;on headlines to cut through the clutter and nonsense... and alert them to the articles (and ads)&nbsp;they really want to focus on. The magazine they&#39;re reading has 268 pages of copy in it, and most of it is advertising with no bearing on their lives whatsoever. .

MORE Why Would You Dare HIDE Your Message Behind A Goofy Headline? . Well, if you&#39;re smart, you won&#39;t. Even though that is exactly what MOST advertisers do. Here&#39;s a little test:&nbsp;Have someone open a magazine - any magazine at all – and read&nbsp;aloud&nbsp;only the headlines of the first twelve ads he sees. Try to guess what product is being touted. . Heck... try to guess what part of the business world they&#39;re in. You&#39;ll see car ads with headlines that talk about jet airliners... credit card company ads that talk about backpacking... and cellular phone manufacturers that talk about living in Paris. . I just picked up recent copies of Maxim, the New Yorker, and Playboy. (Shows you where my interests lie.) Here&#39;s a full page ad showing a crumpled napkin with the word “coffee” scribbled on it, the word “50 cents” crossed out, and “$4.95” written under it. They&#39;re selling Johnny Walker scotch. No trace of a bottle or label to be found. If you can&#39;t read the 5-point line of copy at the bottom, you&#39;d never figure out who paid for the ad. . Here&#39;s a full-page photo of a guy asleep, lying sideways with a blanket and pillow. The headline is “It&#39;s true, you can sleep your way to the top.” Lots of empty . space. In small copy at the bottom, you learn this is an ad for British Airways. Apparently they now offer flat beds in business class. Very clever way to NOT alert your potential customers. . And here&#39;s a full page grainy outdoor shot, with a pony-tailed dude looking out over a darkening valley. Headline: “Let someone else climb the corporate ladder.” Care to guess what the product is? . Chewing tobacco. . One more. Back cover ad, the most expensive real estate in the magazine. Fuzzy, light-colored background you can&#39;t make out. Here&#39;s the copy: “Pate. Pillows. Are GEESE great or what?” . I am not making this up. It&#39;s an ad for&nbsp;Hyatt hotels. These ads are not written by salesmen. And they are not written with the customerin mind. . Nope. They are written to please other dumb-ass corporate copywriters and designers and - worst of all - the client. Most copywriters think if they get the client to like the ad, they&#39;ve been successful. . Horseshit. In fact, I&#39;ve discovered that, frequently, it&#39;s the Kiss Of Death if the client likes the ad. I don&#39;t&nbsp;want&nbsp;the client to like the ad.

Imagine that your headline has “gotten you in the door”. Your opening paragraph is then how you get your prospect to “sit down” and settle in for one of the most fascinating rides of his life. . The easiest technique to use to do that - and it&#39;s one I employ frequently – is the... . MORE “If... Then” Introduction. . It&#39;s very simple. Here&#39;s a couple of examples: “If you&#39;ve always dreamed of a super-effective diet that&#39;s so easy, it works automatically even when you&nbsp;constantly cheat... then this will be the most exciting letter you ever read.” . “If you&#39;d like to get a brand new Porsche 911, for&nbsp;half&nbsp;of what everyone else has to pay (legally)... then you&#39;re going to freak over what I have to share with you here.” . “If you&#39;d love to start firing tennis serves at over 110 miles an hour, with the accuracy of a guided missile… then this will be the most life-changing message you have ever read.” . And so on. Even veteran writers sometimes stumble and mumble when trying to write a killer opening paragraph. This technique gets the job done with absolute minimum fuss. . Another technique is to...&nbsp; . MORE Simply State Your Case. . It sounds straightforward enough, but it&#39;s pure&nbsp;genius&nbsp;in its simplicity: “My name is Dr. O&#39;Malley, and I have just written a book that shows how you can instantly increase the intensity and duration of your orgasms. Here is what I&#39;ve discovered...” . “I am one of fourteen people who have discovered an easy, legal and no-hassle way to get into Cubs games absolutely free. Here is how you can be number fifteen...” . “With your permission - and with strict precautions for your privacy - I want to send you a copy of a vicious hand-to-hand training video that was smuggled out of the . Navy SEALS elite bootcamp...” You get the&nbsp;idea. | These techniques are examples of “reason why” copy. We call it that because, literally, you give your reader a&nbsp;reason&nbsp;to believe every statement you make. . A specific, plausible and compelling reason. . Using this simple technique guarantees that you do not fall into the trap&nbsp;most&nbsp;ad writers fall into. Which is to be unclear and vague. Basically, most ad writers&nbsp; . MORE Brag Without Backing It Up. . Huge mistake. Huge. You tell your reader you&#39;ve got the best product in the universe, and what does he do? He yawns. . But if tell him you have 985,425 current customers worldwide, and outsold your nearest competitor by 46% over the last six years... well, that will perk him up. . Don&#39;t even try telling him you made “a million dollars” last year using your fabulous new idea. -Instead, reprint a letter from your accountant verifying your last bank statement, where you deposited $1,121,347.87. Heck, get a&nbsp;notary public&nbsp;to put her stamp on the thing. . Being specific means...&nbsp; . MORE You Know&nbsp;What You&#39;re Talking About. . And that&#39;s what gives your customer the confidence to buy from you. . You are “credentializing” yourself as a knowledgeable expert... who is about to share everything you know with your customers. You have a reason - and a&nbsp;damn good one, too - behind everything you state. . There&#39;s a reason why you&#39;re writing to him. . There&#39;s a reason why your product is something he will definitely want. There&#39;s a reason why it costs what it does. . And there&#39;s a reason why he has to act right now, or miss out. . Tell him why you&#39;re telling him what you&#39;re telling him! Do as a salesman would when speaking face-to-face with a half-sold customer. Give the poor reader... . MORE A Reason To Buy From You, Right Now. . Explain yourself, Bucko. “I&#39;m writing to you today because I know you are interested in growing roses.” . “I got your name from a mutual friend, who said you&#39;d want to know about this amazing opportunity right away.” . “You recently responded to an ad we ran in USA Today, with this headline...” . “I am writing to everyone who lives in Sleepy Hollow, because something urgent has come up that directly affects&nbsp;your&nbsp;property value...” . And then tell your story, as simply and clearly as you can. One of my favorite ways to do this is by using this phrase to start the second, or at the very latest, the third paragraph: . MORE “Here&#39;s What It&#39;s All About:” . In fact, that simple phrase can be used, with only slight modifications, throughout your copy. It essentially takes the place of the QUESTION your prospect would most naturally ask you at that point... if she was sitting in front of you. But she&#39;s not. So you answer the question that&#39;s in her&nbsp;head, at every juncture: . “Here&#39;s why so many women are using this product:” . “Here is how those Swiss scientists came up with the formula:” “Here&#39;s what this product will do for you:” . “Here is why you don&#39;t risk a penny.” . And... one of the most important explanations in your pitch... . MORE “Here&#39;s How To Order:” . But don&#39;t you dare do that until you have loaded your reader down with more excellent reasons to buy than he can fit into his thinking process. . Mark Twain once said: “There are two reasons a man buys anything. The reason he can tell his wife... and the&nbsp;real&nbsp;reason.” . Take that to heart. You must satisfy the reluctance in your customer&#39;s&nbsp;soul... in his . heart... in his&nbsp;brain... in his&nbsp;bank account... . And In The Minds Of His Friends, Lovers, Neighbors And Spouse. . Don&#39;t just tell him it&#39;s a bargain.&nbsp;Show&nbsp;him, in a way he can easily repeat to convince his wife. . Don&#39;t mumble about excellent engineering. Give him the specs, in a memorable story that will leave his buddies breathless. . Don&#39;t be vague about why you&#39;re in the business. Tell your story, in a way anyone can identify with. . And&nbsp;keep&nbsp;telling your story... but always bring it back to your customer. Tell her why this purchase makes sense. Why it will help her get what she most desires. Why it&#39;s exactly what she&#39;s been waiting for her entire life. . Do you honestly have inside information, or a hot tip, or a way to deliver a better deal than anyone else can get? . Tell me about it. . Do you have an uncle in the Mafia who, just before going off to San Quentin, revealed to you a perfectly legal way to lower your income tax by investing in Euro dollars? . Or, has the taxman surprised you with a bill you can&#39;t pay, and that means you must sell your entire inventory of widgets at fire sale prices? . Or, on a cold drizzling day last March, did a stranger come up to you on the golf course and reveal a simple adjustment to your swing that caused you to suddenly start launching 300-yard howitzer shots off every tee? . Okay. That sounds good. But why should I believe you? Tell me. Is it because you&#39;re a respected oral surgeon in Des Moines, with a reputation like gold? . Or, is your business well-known on the West Coast, with a 25-year track record of honesty and breaking new ground on exciting stuff? . Or, are you just a regular Schmoe who stumbled onto a good thing, and decided to share your good fortune with a few lucky souls... but you insist on treating every . customer the way you wish&nbsp;you&nbsp;were treated - and seldom are - by being outrageously generous and trusting and taking on&nbsp;all&nbsp;the risk yourself? . Okay. Starting to sound pretty tempting. But how can I be sure this will work as advertised?&nbsp;Tell&nbsp;me: “Here&#39;s a short list of satisfied customers, including the Los Angeles Chief of Police, the Duke of Buckingham, and six well-known businessmen in your home town.” . Keep pouring it on. “Here&#39;s why so many professionals and savvy people already are customers.” . “Here&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided on this price, and why it&#39;s a great deal.” “Here&#39;s why you can feel confident you aren&#39;t risking a penny.” . “Here&#39;s how fast you can expect to get exciting results, and here are examples of those results.” . “Here&#39;s how to order, and here&#39;s when to expect your stuff to arrive.” Here&#39;s the story. . Here&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. . One last thought:&nbsp;Always stay one step ahead of your reader. Remember... he&nbsp;expects&nbsp;you to exaggerate and brag and be fast and loose with the facts. That&#39;s what every other advertiser has done since the day he learned to read. . So... don&#39;t lie. Be brutally honest. Just keep imaging your reader shaking his head, saying “Yeah, right.” And then immediately confront that thought: “I&#39;ll bet you think I&#39;m pulling your leg, right? Hey, I thought this sounded `too good to be true&#39;, too. Here&#39;s what convinced me otherwise:” . Never forget that he doesn&#39;t really want to believe you. He&#39;s been taken for a sucker countless times before. He&#39;s&nbsp;never&nbsp;really gotten a fair shake from an advertiser. . So be the first businessman in his life to treat him... like&nbsp;you&nbsp;would like to be treated yourself. Be honest. Offer a good deal, with plenty of opportunity to change his mind. Make the deal legitimately “fool-proof&#39;. And give him lots and lots of reasons to... . &lt;span class=&quot;m-link-label&quot; 9[=&quot;&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/span&gt; .",

    "title": "Agora - Project Prophecy (n)",
    "content": "Project Prophesy . WARNING: Do Not Share With “Non-Cleared” Persons . Hi, Jim Rickards here. . And I’m holding an authorized version of a classified government document in my hand. . It was published by the CIA in the prestigious journal Studies in Intelligence…&nbsp; . And it describes the inner workings of a powerful tool I developed while working with the US government… . A tool that can tip you off about surprising political and economic events… . BEFORE they happen… . Giving you the chance to get ahead of BIG market moves… . And walk away with an average of $15,760… every two weeks! . That’s more than 30 grand a month! . And it couldn’t be easier… . Simply watch these blinking lights on the screen… . And once they turn green, you target that stock by placing one simple trade… . Then cash out a few days later, potentially with a small fortune. . As you’re about to see… . What started as one of the most unusual analytic projects in CIA history… . Became the world’s most powerful predictive tool. . But please do not share this with anyone. . The US government recruited me to develop this system in total secrecy. . To this date, the CIA has given clearance to less than 100 people in the entire world involved with this project. . And if any of us reveal the classified version of this document… . We could be arrested and charged with misuse of classified information. . But since I was a leader of this top-secret project... . I know exactly what I’m allowed to reveal today. . This is the core of a BRAND-NEW investment strategy… designed to make you as much as $15,760… every two weeks. . And because it has never been made public before, all the trade examples I’ll mention today are necessarily drawn from historical data. . Please pay close attention… . Because I’m about to “declassify” some critical information about what was dubbed “Project Prophesy” ... . A project that led to a true game-changer for everyday folks like you. . And once you see how easy this is, you’ll never invest the same way again. . For example… . During the first week of March 2009… . Several bank stocks were blinking in my system. . Now, just to refresh your memory… . Lehman had just gone under a few months earlier… . Nobody wanted anything to do with bank stocks. . In fact, on March 7 The New York Times wrote: . “We have some pretty sick banks in America right now, some of which may not be viable in the long run.” . Strangely enough… . On that exact same day my system flashed green for shares of JPMorgan. Take a look… . Had I told anyone to buy JPMorgan at that time, they’d probably have called me nuts. . But that green light indicated something BIG was about to happen… . Some unexpected macroeconomic event that would send shares exploding higher. . Sure enough… . On March 23, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner announced a $1 trillion plan to end the banking crisis. . Of course, this was great news for US banks… including JPMorgan. . As ABC News reported later that night: . “The plan announcement&nbsp;jolted stocks on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones rallying nearly 500 points.” . And had you placed one simple trade when Prophesy flashed green for JPMorgan… . You could have turned a small investment of $500 into $10,225… . In a little more than 2 weeks. . Amazing, right? . It should have been impossible to profit from this surprising event… . Because by the time everyday folks like you heard the news… . It was already too late to profit. . Only government officials at the White House knew about the $1 trillion plan. . And yet, for reasons that will become clear soon… . The Prophesy system “knew” something big was about to happen… a full two weeks in advance. . And all you had to do to profit was… . Watch for the System to Blink Green… Place One Simple Trade… Then Collect a Big Pile of Cash Two Weeks Later . And because you’re in and out so quick… . Your money isn’t overly exposed to black swans and other unexpected risks. . Look, if you think government officials and bureaucrats around the world are pulling strings behind the scenes… . And making decisions that have a direct impact on YOUR portfolio… . You’re 100% right. . And if you don’t have access to the world’s most powerful predictive tool… . I guarantee you’ll always be caught by surprise. . Simply put, the Prophesy system can allow you to get ahead of surprising political and economic events that trigger big market moves… . BEFORE these things are made public… . I’m talking about getting ahead of… . A major announcement from the Fed… | Surprise government policy changes… | Release of important economic data… | And any UNEXPECTED news that might trigger a ONE-DAY explosion in the stock… | . News that only government insiders can possibly know about. . I even used this tool to correctly predict Trump would win the election. . (In just a moment, I’ll play a short clip of my prediction on live TV.) . Yes, I realize the Prophesy system gives you an unfair advantage… . But it’s also 100% legal. . And It’s the ONLY Way I Know for the Little Guy to Get Ahead of BIG Macroeconomic Events… . And Walk Away With an Average of $15,760 in Two Weeks or Less . For example, look what happened on September 9, 2013. . That’s when the Prophesy system flashed green for US company Geron Corporation. . There wasn’t any news involving the company that day… . No earnings report… no acquisition news… nothing. . But the fact the system was blinking meant something big was about to happen. . Sure enough… . Two weeks later, the US Federal Reserve shocked the markets with a surprising decision to keep interest rates low… . The opposite of what analysts were expecting. . As NPR reported: . “Their decision stunned most economists, who believed Fed officials were ready to switch gears away from the long-standing policy of restraining interest rates.” . The surprising news that the Fed would keep stimulating the economy lit a fire under shares of Geron Corporation. . But unless you worked inside the Federal Reserve… . There was no way for you to know for sure that they would surprise the market. . And if you had waited for the news… . It would have been too late to profit. . But had you placed a simple trade when Prophesy flashed green for Geron… . You could have turned $500 into $5,750… in just two weeks. Take a look… . Imagine if you made that kind of money every two weeks… . That’s an extra $11,500 a month… . And the equivalent of $138,000 a year… more than three times higher than the average salary in America. . Incredible, right? . Simply wait for the light to blink… . Place one simple trade… . Then walk away with thousands of dollars a few days later… . You’re In… You’re Out! No Need to Leave Your Portfolio Exposed to Black-Swan Events . And because the Prophesy system is always blinking… . There are fast-money opportunities like this every week. . For example, looking back on November 28, 2011… . The Prophesy system flashed green for financial service company MBIA. . Again, there was nothing happening with the company. . The only big news that day was about the risks of the European debt crisis. . As the Financial Times wrote: . “The risk of a grave economic crisis in Europe is severe… It would depress trade and threaten the global financial system.” . It didn’t seem like a good time to be buying stocks. . But according to Prophesy, you should have just ignored the gloom and doom news. . Sure enough… . Just two days later the US government released this shocking press release: . In an unprecedented coordinated effort… . All major central banks decided to stimulate the global economy. . No wonder stocks exploded higher… . Later, ABC News explained that the big move was triggered by… . “A globally coordinated central-bank effort to ease the sovereign-debt crisis that has roiled markets for months.” . Unless you worked for one of the central banks involved in that secret deal… . There was no way for you to know about this announcement in advance. . But the Prophesy system “knew” something was about to happen… . And had you invested just $500 in a simple MBIA trade… . You could have cashed out with $5,320 just one week later. . That’s pretty cool, right? . Just with these three examples I showed you… . Starting with a tiny investment of $500… . You could have made… . $10,225 in JPM in about two weeks… | $5,750 in GERN in two weeks… | $5,320 in MBIA in a week… | . That’s a Total of $21,295… In a Little More Than a Month! . And all you had to do was wait for Prophesy to flash green… . Place one simple trade… . Then cash out a few days later with thousands in your pocket. . Do you see now how life-changing the Prophesy system can be? . It’s the only tool in the world that can tell you something BIG is going to happen BEFORE it happens. . Of course, this is no crystal ball. . There is no such thing as absolute certainty when it comes to the stock market… . Which means the system isn’t right 100% of the time. . But this is so powerful that it can “predict” even the most unpredictable market events you can think of. . I’m talking about BIG surprises that send certain stocks exploding higher. . For example, the Prophesy system flashed green for shares of gold stock Newmont Mining on June 2, 2016. . Then a few weeks later something interesting happened… . On June 24, the so-called Brexit shocked the world when UK voters chose to leave the European Union… . Creating panic in the markets. . USA Today published a story with the headline: . “US stocks hammered as Brexit shock rocks markets” . And went on to say… . “The US stock market suffered its worst drop in 10 months Friday as shock over the UK voters&#39; move to exit the European Union… sent global markets into a tailspin.” . In the US, the big surprise wiped out roughly $800 billion in market value. . I thought the Prophesy system had failed… . But lo and behold… . Look what happened with shares of Newmont. . In the midst of the market carnage, shares EXPLODED after Brexit was announced. . Later CNBC published a story explaining what was behind the big move: . “Newmont is likely benefiting from its gold mining operations as investors seek safe havens from the volatile markets.” . By the time regular folks like you heard about this from CNBC… . It was already too late to profit. . But had you placed a small bet of $1,000 in a simple trade when Prophesy flashed green for Newmont… . You could have walked away with $7,130 in less than a month. . That’s seven times your money… in a time when most people lost their shirt. . And because you’re in and out of the market in a matter of weeks… . You could compound your money really fast. . At that pace, by next month you could add $20,400 to your bank account… . And by next year, you’d be looking at an extra income of $265,200! . Imagine how that kind of money would change your life! . And let me tell you this… . ***If you’ve never made money from surprising events like these… it’s NOT your fault. . It’s virtually impossible to catch those moves without a system like Prophesy. . And like I mentioned before… . This breakthrough simply wasn’t available to regular folks like you. . Only a small group of people with CIA clearance had access. . And no wonder intelligence officers dubbed this CIA mission “Project Prophesy”… . It can prophesize even the most “unthinkable” political and economic events… . And put you AHEAD of big market moves that nobody expects… . Giving you the chance to make $5,320, $7,130, and even $39,640 in a matter of days. . Case in point… Look what happened during the last presidential election. . Did the Prophesy System “Know” Trump Would Win the Presidential Election? . Right up until election night, the so-called experts were giving Hillary a 98% chance of winning. . It seemed foolish for anyone to go on live TV and tell the world that all the pundits were wrong… . And that Trump would win. . But that’s exactly what I did on November 8. . You can watch my TV prediction in the 1-minute clip below. (It’s quite entertaining.) . As you can see, it’s a matter of public record that I was one of the few who correctly predicted Trump would win the election. . But here’s what I did NOT say on TV... . Behind the scenes I was using the Prophesy system… . To help me analyze those “unpredictable” events, including the election. . And leading up to Election Day… . The Prophesy system was flashing all kinds of signals. . For example, on November 6, two days before the election… . It was blinking green for shares of steel companies US Steel and AK Steel. . Three days later… BOOM! . Shares of those two companies exploded after the election result was announced. . Remember, during the campaign Trump promised to spend $550 billion on infrastructure projects, including bridges, highways and buildings… . Projects that would boost demand for steel. . Was the signal on those two steel companies telling us Trump would win? . All I know is this… . Had you invested $1,000 when Prophesy flashed green for AK Steel… . You could have made $10,830 in a little more than two weeks. . Shares of US Steel exploded even higher. . And on that same day, had you invested another $1,000 on that trade… . You could have made another $39,640. . From those two simple trades… . That’s a total of $50,470… . A good annual salary for most people… . That you would have collected in a little more than two weeks. . Imagine watching “crooked Hillary” losing the election in the most decisive way… . And YOU getting $50,000 richer in the process! . Can you think of a better election result? . Keep in mind… . Trump was declared the winner at 2:45 am on November 9. . Shares of those companies EXPLODED instantly… . By the time the markets opened, it was already too late to profit. . You had to be IN the trade before the election result was announced. . And that was only possible if you were using Prophesy. . Everyone else was late to the party. . Case in point… It wasn’t until November 14 that the Financial Times wrote: . “US Steel [and] AK Steel saw their stock ratings upgraded by Morgan Stanley analysts in the wake of last week’s election, pushing their share prices up.” . That was 8 days AFTER Prophesy gave the green light on those two stocks. . Like I said… . This system gives you an unfair advantage… . Putting you AHEAD of even professional Wall Street analysts. . Of course, the explosive gains I’ve been showing you don’t happen every day. . But even a small fraction of rare gains like these could make you a quick fortune. . It truly is a game-changer for Main Street to get ahead of Wall Street. . And I’m afraid that without this tool… . You will NEVER be able to profit from those surprising macroeconomic events... . Because the truth is… . The Game Is Rigged! And Without a System Like Prophesy, the Little Guy Has No Chance! . As you can tell by now… . Government officials around the world often are directly involved in these surprising macro events… . And because of their “insider” position… . They have access to privileged information. . That’s extremely valuable. . After all, information is MONEY! . As The New York Times says… . “The pervasive role of the government in the economy makes [policy] information particularly valuable to investors. And that can lead some to get a jump on the market if they learn about changes in policy before others.” . That’s why the big dogs on Wall Street often hire specialized “political intelligence” lobbyists in Washington… . Just to get insider knowledge of major government decisions… . So they can place trades before you and I hear about it in the news. . You see, when it comes to market-moving policies… . Government officials and other well-connected insiders are always the first ones to know about it. . Then they start passing information to their staff… . To their family and friends… . Then to the media… . By the time you and I hear the news, it’s already too late. . All the money has already been made. . Let’s face it… . Information (and remember, information is money) trickles down... . And everyday folks like you are at the bottom of the chain. . I’m sure you’ve noticed that too, right? . These people are basically making the rules of the game… . And hardworking Americans like you have no chance. . Does That Seem Fair to You? . Of course not! . Look, even though I have connections that go from CEOs of major banks and members of the Federal Reserve… . All the way to the US Treasury and the White House… . I didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth. . I grew up in a typical middle-class family in New Jersey. . My father even went bankrupt when I was growing up. . So even though I constantly rub shoulders with government officials and the so-called global elite… . I always knew it wasn’t fair for them to get richer… . While the little guys feed on the table scraps in the markets. . That’s why I’m so excited to “declassify” Project Prophesy for you today. . The way I see it… . The Prophesy system is the only way for everyday folks to beat these government insiders at their own game… | By getting ahead of big policy moves before they’re announced to the public… | And by getting ahead of surprising political and economic events… | And potentially make $5,320, $7,130, and even $39,640… | . In two weeks or less… . And do it over and over again. . But you might be wondering… . Why Would the CIA Develop a Tool to Predict Big, Unexpected Market Events? . The truth is Project Prophesy started as a counterterrorist tool. . You see, the CIA uncovered evidence that terrorists and their associates often get involved in the markets right BEFORE big attacks. . Just look what happened on the 9/11 attacks. . Four days before the planes hit the Twin Towers… . Someone made huge bets against shares of American Airlines and United Airlines… . The operators of the four flights that were hijacked on 9/11. . Yes, all signs indicate someone in the hijackers’ social network (financial backers, family or friends) KNEW the attack was going to happen… . And they were trying to profit from a sure bet. . That’s exactly what happened. . After the attack, shares of those two airlines collapsed… . Thousands of Americans were dead. . But those traders walked away with $16 million, according to a study conducted by the Swiss Finance Institute. . So not long after the attack… . When the CIA called my office in New York… . And asked me to join a top-secret project… to help them use market data to predict the next terrorist attack… . I immediately said, “Yes, count me in!” . It All Started at the CIA Headquarters in 2001, Just Weeks After the 9/11 Attack . Me and the team of experts who participated in the CIA’s market analysis. . The CIA recruited me for a few reasons. . First, I was an expert in Islamic banking (I helped Western banks like Citibank expand their business in Islamic countries)… | Second, I was a portfolio manager, lawyer, and economist with 30+ years of experience... | And third, I was no stranger to the US government. (I helped them defuse a major banking crisis in the late 1990s involving a hedge fund called LTCM.) | Given my unique background, I soon became a director of Project Prophesy… . Where I led a team of over 100 experts… . Including Nobel Prize winners, hedge fund managers, stock exchange executives, and computer hackers. . Our goal was clear… . If the CIA could develop a system to analyze unusual market activity (such as huge bets against airlines with no apparent reason)… . They could use that system to predict and thwart the next 9/11. . We spent years developing a prototype of a Project Prophesy machine… . Using Artificial Intelligence, applied mathematics, news feeds, price feeds, and computing and human oversight. . And the result is what you see below… . This Is an Actual Screenshot of the Prophesy System… the Same One Developed at the CIA . But would it work? . We didn’t know for sure… . But on Monday, August 7, 2006… the Prophesy system picked up unusual activity in shares of American Airlines. . Less than 72 hours later, something incredible happened… . CNN published the following breaking news: . . British intelligence agencies took down a major terrorist plot… . A plot to blow up an American Airlines flight to New York in mid-air using chemicals in innocent-looking liquid form. . (If you’ve ever wondered why you can’t take large liquids on airplanes… now you know why!) . I was speechless! . This confirmed the Prophesy system worked like a charm! . And I soon realized the system wasn’t just a counterterrorist tool. . Because terrorists are NOT the only ones who leave footprints in the markets. . Anyone who has some type of privileged information… . And places an unusual trade might trigger an alert! . So by tracking unusual market activity… . The Prophesy system has the ability to predict other “unthinkable” events… . Such as a major announcement from the government… | Surprising economic policies… | And any economic or political event that might trigger a ONE-DAY explosion in the stock… | . News that only government insiders can possibly know about. . And because you’ll have a chance to get AHEAD of everyone else… . You could easily walk away with $5,320, $7,130, and even $39,640… in two weeks or less. . That’s why I’m excited to announce… . After 15 Years of Secrecy, I’m “Declassifying” This System… But With One Huge UPGRADE . Even though the Prophesy system quickly became the biggest breakthrough in the history of data analysis… . I wanted to make it even better. . That’s why I’ve recently partnered with IBM to “upgrade” the Prophesy system. . Me at the IBM Watson supercomputer headquarters . You’ve probably seen the TV commercials for Watson, the world’s most powerful Artificial Intelligence. . Well, thanks to this partnership… . Project Prophesy is now on digital steroids… . With more sophisticated math… . Better Artificial Intelligence… . And much more processing power from Watson. . No wonder the recent historical analyses my team did blew us all away. . The results of this back testing were nothing short of STUNNING. . Starting with just $1,000… . ***It showed me the upgraded Prophesy system has the potential to hand you an average profit of $15,760… in less than two weeks! . And remember, since you can take profits so quickly… . When you start compounding these returns, your money multiplies very quickly. . In fact, those $15,760 in two weeks add up to more than $409,000 in a year. . And because I personally helped develop the Prophesy system… . I’m the ONLY person in the world who can tell you… . Exactly everything you need to know to start pocketing the BIGGEST and FASTEST gains you’ll ever see. . How fast could you get rich? . Let me show you… . When You Can Get Into a Trade Just BEFORE a Major Government Announcement… You Can Make a Fortune in Lightning-Fast Speed . Just look what happened right before Christmas in 2014. . On December 22, the Prophesy system flashed green for shares of gold miner Newmont Mining. . Sure enough… . About three weeks later, the Swiss National Bank shocked the world when it suddenly abandoned its currency peg against the euro. . Unless you worked for the Swiss National Bank… . There was no way for you to know that was going to happen. . In fact, that decision stunned everyone… . Including the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, who called the move “a bit of a surprise.” . BBC News later reported the market impact: . “Stock markets fell with investors buying ‘safe haven’ assets such as gold.” . Well, with investors flocking into gold, guess what happened with shares of Newmont Mining? . Exactly! It exploded higher. . And had you placed one simple bet when Prophesy flashed… . You could have turned that surprising event into a $18,100 payday. . Again, instead of getting caught by a surprising event… . Triggered by some government bureaucrat across the Atlantic… . You would have walked away with a fortune… . Without leaving your money exposed to long-term market volatility. . All you had to do was... . Wait for Prophesy to flash green… | Place one simple bet… | Then cash out a few days later. | That’s amazing, right? . Here’s another example… . On March 31, 2009, the Prophesy system flashed green for the Ohio bank holding company Huntington Bancshares. . And the funny thing is… . On that same day, three other US banks were flashing green. . Was this a coincidence? . Or was something big about to happen to the banking sector? . Well, about three days later The Washington Post broke the news: . “The board that sets US accounting rules voted… to let financial firms report higher values for some troubled assets, a controversial step likely to increase some banks&#39; reported earnings.” . In other words… . The bureaucrats who make the accounting rules decided to give the banks more discretion in valuing their dicey assets. . No doubt this was great news for the banks… . But unless you worked closely with the accounting rule makers… . There was no way for you know that they would change the rules. . And yet, the Prophesy system “knew” it. . And had you placed a simple bet of $2,500… . You could have walked away with $27,500 in just about two weeks… . From an event that was totally unpredictable. . Do you see now why Prophesy is the world’s #1 predictive tool? . Simply watch the flashing lights... | Place one simple trade when you get a signal... | Then walk away with a fortune a few days later… | Without risking your hard-earned money in long-term market plays. . Instead of being caught off guard by unexpected events… . You’ll be getting AHEAD of them… . And getting positioned for the big move… BEFORE they happen. . Sometimes the Gains Happen in a Matter of Days… . Look what happened on July 24, 2012… . That’s when the Prophesy system flashed green for Terex, a construction equipment maker with larger-than-average exposure to Europe. . Just two days later the head of the European Central Bank (ECB) made a shocking statement that sent stocks exploding higher. . Later that day, Forbes reported… . “The Dow Jones notched a triple-digit gain today, after ECB President Mario Draghi said he would do whatever is needed to save the [euro].” . Unless you worked closely with Mr. Draghi… . There was no way for you to know what was going to happen. . And had you waited for the news, it would have been too late to profit. . But had you placed one simple bet when the Prophesy system flashed green… . You could have made a fortune… . Because shares of Terex skyrocketed. Take a look… . In this case, you could have walked away with $28,000… . In just 7 days. . Imagine if you made that kind of extra weekly income? . You’d be able to finally tell your spouse, “Honey, we no longer have to worry about money… ever again!” . That’s what makes this top-secret system I’ve developed at the CIA headquarters such a revolutionary tool. . The little guy finally has a chance to profit from these big one-day moves… . Moves that have been making insiders rich for years… . University of Washington Confirms: Government Insiders Have a Clear Advantage Over the Little Guy . Have you ever wondered why Nancy Pelosi has a $196 million net worth… . Even though her government salary is “only” $174,000? . Sure, she rails against income inequality and claims to be fighting for the little guy… . All while living the good life of the top 0.1% in America… . In the comfort of her multimillion-dollar Georgetown condo… . Drinking wine from her personal 16-acre vineyard in Napa Valley. . How can these government insiders accumulate so much wealth? . While we can’t trace the source of all that money for sure… . Shocking research from the University of Washington might have the answer. . It shows that government insiders have an unfair advantage over everyday folks like you. . As you know, the actions of the federal government can have a huge impact on financial markets. . So the authors of the study analyzed the US Senate… . Looking for data that would support the notion that insiders were taking advantage of privileged information… . And getting AHEAD of you, me and everyone who heard about their policy changes in the news. . As the study describes… . “As prominent participants in the government decision making process, US senators are likely to have knowledge of forthcoming government actions before the information becomes public. This could provide them with an informational advantage over other investors.” . &nbsp; . The study’s conclusion? . Yes, they have a huge advantage. . Using data from that same study, Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, confirmed: . “US senators beat the market by 12% a year. Either these senators are incredibly smart or something else is going on. And I think most people would assume something else was going on.” . And Business Insider reported, . “Elected officials use their legislative positions to reap financial rewards…” and they use “inside knowledge to play the stock market.” . Imagine how much money you could make if, like these insiders, you had the chance to get ahead of… . Major economic policies… . Official government announcements… . Or any piece of political or economic information that might trigger a big market move. . You could even escape unscathed from big market crashes… . That’s exactly what happened to several members of Congress in the 2008 collapse. . It’s shocking, but true. . Just 12 days before the 2008 economic meltdown… . At least 10 members of Congress pulled their money out of the stock market. . They had secret meetings with the Treasury Department and the Fed… . Some were secretly told that it was “a matter of days before there is a meltdown in the global financial system.” . They knew the “stuff” was about to hit the fan. . While millions of Americans lost their homes and their life savings… . They didn’t lose a dime in the crash. . One Congressman even placed bets against the market and nearly DOUBLED his money from the crash… in just four days. . We already knew most politicians are crooks. . But that’s crazy, right? . Friend, that rigged game ends today. . Because with Project Prophesy… . The Little Guy Finally Has a Chance to Get AHEAD of Major Political and Economic Events That Could Trigger Big Market Moves . As you’ve seen so far, there’s ONLY one way to capture those BIG surprising market moves… . You have to be “in” the trade BEFORE the major economic or political event becomes public news. . And since you’re not a government insider… . There’s ONLY one way for you to do that… by using the Prophesy system. . You see, just like terrorists left footprints in the market BEFORE the 9/11 attacks… . Other investors who might have privileged information also tend to leave footprints BEFORE major macroeconomic events… . By placing unusual trades in the market. . Think about it… . If there’s no news about a specific company… . And yet someone placed an unusually large bet… . It’s very likely they know something that we don’t, right? . That’s the essence of the Prophesy system. . It uses a proprietary algorithm to track what insiders and people with special information are doing with their money… . In real time. . For obvious reasons, I can’t reveal the entire formula here. . The original calculations I worked off of are buried in the CIA classified document only. . But here’s a simplified version… . (If N=0, Insider Behavior &gt; 60, GREEN, Insider Behavior &lt; 30, RED) . Where N represents news about the company… . Insider behavior represents unusual market activity… . And green and red represent the recommended course of action. . And don’t worry… you don’t even need to understand any of that in order to profit. . That’s because the Prophesy system calculates everything for you. . The algorithm picks up when the trade data moves out of its normal range. . For example, it might be normal to see someone buy 500,000 shares of Microsoft after a surprisingly good earnings report. . But if someone buys 2 million shares with no news about the company… it might trigger a green light on the Prophesy system. . Simply put, when the light blinks… . It means for some reason… . Sophisticated traders who might have insider information are betting heavily on the company. . That’s how it can tip you off about BIG moves before they happen. . Because the truth is… . Someone somewhere knows about these political and economic events BEFORE you and I hear about them on the news. . Just look what happened with shares of health insurance company UnitedHealth Group back in 2013. . Imagine Making $33,875 in About a Week… From an “Unpredictable” Event in the Health Industry! . On March 23, 2013, there was no significant news about the company… . But the algorithm behind the Prophesy system picked up unusual market activity. . The system was flashing green. . Simply put, this was a sign someone knew something BIG was about to happen in the healthcare sector. . About a week later, BOOM! . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made a shocking Medicare announcement… . It announced insurance firms would receive more money from the government’s Medicare Advantage plan. . Shares of health insurance companies exploded higher! . AFTER the big move, analysts at Credit Suisse said the government’s decision “significantly improved the 2014 outlook” for US health insurers. . Did someone know this major Medicare change was going to happen? . Yes... government insiders knew exactly what was going to happen! . Email records of employees at the Department of Health and Human Services showed that 436 of them had early access to the Medicare decision… . As much as two weeks before it was made public. . The Washington Post later reported: . “Hundreds of federal employees were given advance word of a Medicare decision worth billions of dollars to private insurers in the weeks before the official announcement, a period when trading in the shares of those firms spiked.” . Of course, by the time everyday folks like you heard about this Medicare change in the news… . It was already too late to profit. . Only the insiders who had access to that privileged information had a chance to profit from the big move in health insurance stocks. . Simply put, these people were making a sure bet. . And they left a footprint in the market… . Triggering a green light on the Prophesy system. . And had you placed one simple bet of $2,500 on UnitedHealth Group… . You could have pocketed a huge profit of $33,875 in a little more than a week. . Do you see now how the Prophesy system levels the playing field? . Like I said before, information IS money. . And if you get ahead of big, unexpected news… . You could walk away with a fortune… . In a matter of days. . Just look what happened with shares of Citibank back in 2009. . Turning a Surprising SEC Announcement Into a $52,500 Payday . The troubled bank had just lost $37.5 billion. . And lots of people thought it would not survive the crisis. . On March 5, CNN wrote: . “Investors continue to have a dire outlook for the bank.” . Around that time, professional investors known as “short sellers” were betting against the bank… . Helping push shares lower. As MarketWatch wrote: . “Rising numbers of investors are short selling Citi&#39;s common shares. That could put even more pressure on the firm&#39;s stock.” . Despite the negative press… . And despite short sellers betting against the bank… . On March 7, 2009, the Prophesy system picked up unusual market activity on shares of Citibank. . The system was flashing green. . Did someone know something was about to save Citibank from the downward trend? . Nobody knows for sure… . But just three days later a big surprise hit the market… . The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it was going to change the rules of short selling. . Short sellers would no longer be allowed to increase their bets against shares of companies that were already plunging. . Of course, that was HUGE news for Citibank. . Shares exploded higher. . And while most people missed that surprising move… . Had you used the Prophesy system… . You could have walked away with a $52,500 payday… in less than two weeks! . Incredible, right? . These government insiders literally changed the rules of the game… . But everyday folks like you were the last ones to know about it. . It would have been virtually impossible for you to make money from this surprising move. . But with the Prophesy system, making this quick fortune would have been not only possible… . But EASY… . Because all you had to do was... . Watch the green light… | Place one simple trade… | Then cash out a few days later. | And there are opportunities like that every week. . In fact, just a few days after flashing green for Citibank… . The Prophesy system also flashed green for Fifth Third Bank… . $20,000 in Two Weeks?!? It’s Only Possible With the Prophesy System . On March 30, 2009, the Prophesy system picked up unusual activity in shares of this US regional bank. . After hours of research, I couldn’t find any piece of big news involving the bank on that date. . But then four days later… . The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed the accounting rules in a way that would boost the reported earnings of major banks. . Did someone inside FASB placed those trades? . Or was it one of the congressmen who were pressuring the board to make the change? . Nobody knows for sure. . All I know is the little guy was caught off guard again. . But it didn’t have to be that way. . Because had you placed one simple bet when the Prophesy system flashed green… . You could have cashed out with $20k in a little more than two weeks! . That’s like getting a $20,000 paycheck… . Without doing any work. . The equivalent of an annual income of almost half a million dollars. . And it couldn’t be easier… . Simply place a trade after it flashes green… . Then cash out a few days later with a potential fortune. . Rinse and repeat! . Prophesy flashed green for MDC Partners a few days before Trump’s election. . Less than two weeks later, BOOM. . You could have walked away with $23,325! . It flashed green for Akamai Technologies right before a big announcement from the ECB. . Seven days later, BOOM. You could have walked away with $15,600. . On November 5, 2016, it flashed green for SLM Corp. . 12 days later… BOOM. Walk away with $70,000. . Like I mentioned before, there’s no reason to risk your money in long-term plays… . You’re in… . You’re out. . It’s really a shame this powerful indicator has remained a secret for so long… . But that all changes today… . Because my screen is blinking right now! . The Prophesy System Just Flashed Green… Get In Now Before You Read About It in the News . Take a look… . The Prophesy system is flashing green for this company in the resource sector. . That means the system has detected unusual market activity… . And that someone somewhere probably knows something BIG is about to happen to this company. . It’s time to get ahead of everyone else. . There’s no time to waste. . To help you get started… . I’ve created a secure link called Declassified: How to Make $15,760 From Your First Prophesy Trade. . For reasons of national security… . I want to get this in the hands of a very small group of people. . That’s why I’m giving “clearance” to only 1,000 people today. . After we reach that limit, I’ll have to shut it down. . I’d like to send you this secret link in the next 5 minutes. . Remember, the average Prophesy trade has the potential to hand you a profit of $15,760… in less than two weeks! . That means two weeks from now… you could be adding $15,760 or more to your bank account. . Of course, I don’t have insider information on this company… . So I can’t tell you exactly what might happen… . What kind of political or economic event might hit… . Or when the big move may happen. . All we know is the Prophesy system picked up unusual trading activity… . And that means some BIG announcement could happen as early as tomorrow… . If that happens, this opportunity will be gone FOREVER. . It will be too late to profit once you read about it in the financial news. . Which is why I’d like to rush you this top-secret link right now. . And there’s more… . Because this link is just a small part of a brand-new project… . Project Prophesy: Now Open to Everyday Folks Like You . Like I mentioned before… . Thanks to a recent partnership with IBM… . The Prophesy system is now on steroids. . I even launched a separate venture around that partnership… . With the goal of selling access to the system to BIG institutional investors… . Such as sovereign wealth funds that have anywhere from $100 billion to even $1 trillion in assets under management. . These institutional clients will have to pay an annual fee of $5 million. . They will be happy to pay that amount… . Because they know there’s nothing like Prophesy out there. . With the help of IBM&#39;s Watson supercomputer… . We now have the ability to read 10,000 financial blogs… 200 million tweets… thousands of financial statements… and 500 million Facebook pages… . All at the same time… . With the supercomputer doing word association... . And looking for key pieces of insider information that could move the markets. . That’s the power of having the most powerful Artificial Intelligence on the planet working for YOU! . Soon institutional investors will be paying $5 million a year to gain access to all that Prophesy can do. . But I don’t think it’s fair for only institutional investors to gain access. . That’s why I’m also launching a new project designed for everyday folks like you… . I’m calling it Jim Rickards’ Project Prophesy. . You don’t need to be a venture capitalist… | You don’t need to be an accredited investor… | And you don’t need a lot of money to get started with this strategy. | . Like I mentioned before, I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth… . So I want to open this up for hardworking Americans like you… . Who might never have a chance to make money in the markets without the help of a system like Prophesy. . As far as I know, it’s the only system in the world that can help you make an average profit of $15,760 in less than two weeks! . And do it over and over again. . Today we’re opening the doors to 1,000 new members. . Here’s how this brand-new research service works… . &nbsp; . STEP 1: First, every other Tuesday I will be using the Prophesy system to identify unusual market activity across the US market… | STEP 2: As soon as the system flashes, I’ll do my own analysis of each opportunity with the help of IBM’s Watson. And I’ll find the one that could hand you the BIGGEST gain. | STEP 3: Finally, I’ll send you an email with the exact instructions on how to profit… the exact set-up, what trade to make, and when to take any profits. | . We’ll only make our research and recommendations available to members of Rickards’ Project Prophesy. . And to help you get started, I’ll also send you a FREE handbook called The Project Prophesy X-Files. . It should take you less than 10 minutes to read it. Inside, you’ll find… . Why my strategy can actually be safer than how most people trade stocks. (In fact, it can reduce your risk exposure by 25-50% if used correctly.) | How to make these kinds of trades within your Individual Retirement Account (IRA)… | How to try every single trade recommendation without risking a penny of your own capital on investing... | . And to make it even easier for you… . I went one step further and recorded a 6-part video series explaining everything. . In this special series, I’ll show you… . How anyone can execute these trades in less than 10 minutes a week… even if you’ve never invested before… | How you could literally get started with just $100… | And how you can make money regardless of what the market is doing… even if there’s a market crash. | . Of course, I’ll also immediately send you the secure link I promised. . It will have the subject line Declassified: How to Make $15,760 From Your First Project Prophesy Trade. . Remember, the Prophesy system has just flashed green for this company. . Do insiders know something big is about to be announced? . It’s time to jump in… before any potential news hits the public. . This secure link will give you all the details on how to open this trade. . Everything I’ve mentioned so far is yours FREE… as soon as you join Jim Rickards’ Project Prophesy. . Imagine accessing the power behind the world’s most powerful predictive tool… . The only tool that can help you get AHEAD of big moves, giving you the chance to… . Make $5,320, $7,130, and Even $39,640 in a Matter of Days… Over and Over Again . How much would that be worth to you? . Before you answer… . Remember, we’re talking about a revolutionary tool that allows you to get ahead of big economic and political news BEFORE the public. . I’ve personally invested $200,000 of my own money… . And hundreds of hours of my time working on the models and analytics, easily worth $500,000 of sweat equity. . And like I mentioned earlier… . I’ll soon be selling access to institutional clients for an annual fee of $5 million. . In other words, there’s a ton of money wrapped up into this project. . But don’t worry… . This special membership to Project Prophesy won’t cost anywhere near $5 million… or $50,000… or even $10,000… . Because we’ve specifically designed this with you in mind… to level the playing field. . That’s why I’m only opening this up to a small group… . To spread our research costs over the fast-acting people who are watching this presentation today. . I’ll give you all the details of this special offer in a moment… . First, I understand you might still have some questions about our strategy… . I’ve tried to anticipate the most common ones. Let me answer them right now. . QUESTION: “What if one of those surprising macro events triggers a crash in the stock? Will I lose money?” ANSWER: Not necessarily. With the upgraded Prophesy, you can make money even when the markets are plunging. . As I’ve showed you so far, when the Prophesy system flashes green, it means the stock is about to explode higher… . But that’s not all. . The upgraded version of Prophesy also flashes a red light when stocks are vulnerable to a crash. . Simply put, if the system flashes red… . It means something BIG is about to happen… something that will push that stock lower… . And if you place one simple trade, you could turn the crash into a small fortune. . For example, look what happened in 2014. . On November 21, the Prophesy system flashed red for not one… not two… but three oil stocks… . Oasis Petroleum, Sanchez Energy and Whiting Petroleum Corp. . Did insiders know something really bad was about to happen to oil stocks? . I can’t say for sure… . All I know is that six days later Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil minister and OPEC member Ali Al-Naimi delivered a blow to the oil market. . CNN explained later that week: . “Oil prices came crashing down Thursday to trade below $70 per barrel after OPEC announced it was leaving oil production levels unchanged. Many had expected OPEC to agree on a cut to oil production in a bid to boost prices.” . Shares of Oasis, Sanchez Energy and Whiting Petroleum Corp. collapsed! . But instead of losing your shirt from this unexpected announcement… . You could have walked away with a fortune. Take a look. . Had you placed one simple trade on Oasis when Prophesy flashed red, you could have pocketed a cool $70,000… in less than 3 weeks. . And had you placed the same type of trade on Sanchez when Prophesy flashed red, you could have pocketed another $53,625… during the same time. . The gains would have been even BIGGER and FASTER in Whiting Petroleum… . Because had you placed the same type of trade when Prophesy flashed red, you could have made an incredible $144,000… in just ten days. . Isn’t that amazing? . With these three trades alone, you could have made an easy $267,625... in less than a month. . That’s enough money to buy a new high-end BMW for your spouse… . Take your entire family on a luxury vacation… . Pay your kids’ or grandkids’ tuition… . And STILL have money left over to do whatever you want. . It’s really simple… . If Prophesy flashes green, it means some unexpected event could push the stock higher… . And if it flashes red, it means some unexpected event could push the stock lower. . That means you can make money… no matter what happens! . Does that mean my system is right 100% of the time? . Of course not. There’s always risk involved when it comes to investing. . But all you need to do is place one simple trade for a chance to profit. . I’ll explain all the details in The Project Prophesy X-Files. . QUESTION: “Does this strategy involve buying stocks?” ANSWER: You’re welcome to buy stocks. But in order to maximize your potential gains, we’ve paired the Prophesy system with a fast-moving strategy. . I have no doubt you could make a nice profit if you simply buy shares of companies when Prophesy flashes green. . But if you want to collect the big money… . In a matter of days… . You’ll need to go beyond the stock market… . And use something I call “money-multiplier contracts.” . It’s a financial instrument that maximizes the profits of fast-moving opportunities. . They can boost your gains by a factor of up to 73 times. . That means if a stock jumps 10% in a day due to unexpected good news… . This contract can go up by 730%! . And that’s how you’re able to make a fortune… FAST! . How fast? . Sometimes these big gains can happen within days… . Just look what happened with shares of Pulte Group in 2012… . Prophesy flashed green on Tuesday, July 24… . Three days later… BOOM! . Imagine investing $2,500 on a Tuesday… . And cashing out with $52,500 on a Friday! . Even better… . Compared to the price of stocks… . These contracts cost almost nothing. . That means you can get started with very little money… . Sometimes as little as $50. . And it couldn’t be easier to place those trades. . Even if you never invested before, all it takes is a few clicks on your computer. . I’ll walk you through it step by step in The Project Prophesy 6-Part Video Series. . It’s truly a match made in heaven… . With the predictive power of the Prophesy system… . And these money-multiplier contracts… . I promise you’ll see the fastest gains ever. . QUESTION: “Do I have to spend my day watching my computer screen?” ANSWER: In Jim Rickards’ Project Prophesy I’ll do all the grunt work for you. . The short answer is… no. . As I mentioned before, only institutional investors who pay the $5 million fee will gain direct access to the system. They’ll have to watch their screen all day. .

    "content": "WARNING: Viewer discretion is advised! . WARNING: . The Following Message About The Financial System Will Be Disturbing to Some Audiences. . &nbsp; The US Dollar Is About To Collapse. This Letter To Trump Could Be The Only Thing That Saves it. . &nbsp; Viewer Discretion Is Advised! . Note: this message was written before the COVID-19 pandemic. . Hi, my name is Jim Rickards. . In the next 60 seconds I’m going to show you an urgent letter I’ve just written to President Trump. . You see, I’ve spent the last 40 years advising top government officials… . In the late 1990s, for example, I worked with members of the Federal Reserve bank to save America from a $1.3 trillion banking crisis. . It would have imploded the US economy. But thanks to my work, it never happened. . After 9/11, I started working with senior military leaders at the Pentagon and the highest ranks of the CIA. . And helped them develop a financial model to predict the next 9/11… by analyzing unusual activity in airline stocks. . A few years later, in 2007, I delivered a message to the US Treasury. . Warning them the housing collapse was about to get a whole lot worse. . But in all those years… . And despite all those threats to our nation… . I never had to write a letter to the president of the United States… . Until today! . Take a look… . I recently wrote this letter to President Trump… . Warning him about what I expect to happen by June 30th, 2020… . And I want to share my findings with you today… . Because thanks to this event… . You now have a small retirement window. . If you’re older than 60, the next days will be critical for you… . Take the right steps, and you could secure a comfortable retirement in 2020. . If you do nothing during that small window of opportunity… . I’m afraid you’ll NEVER be able to retire comfortably. . I know that’s a huge claim… . And that what I’m about to tell you may be hard to believe… . But I’ve built my career predicting events that most people thought were “unthinkable”… . When I predicted the mortgage crisis, for example, nobody believed me either. . In the summer of 2008, I wrote this letter to top advisors in the presidential campaign: . “We can expect another panic spike in October 2008. This financial crisis is not over.” . Unfortunately, everyone in Washington thought such a systemic collapse was impossible. . But three weeks later Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy… . Panic took over… . And markets crashed across the globe, wiping out $10.2 trillion of wealth. . Those who ignored my warnings lost everything. . But had you placed one single trade I’ll tell you more about later… . You could have turned a small retirement account of $10,000 into $293,900… . In a matter of months. . More recently, I predicted that the UK would vote to leave the European Union (the so-called Brexit). . Nobody believed that could happen. . Once again, those who ignored me were caught completely off guard. . This has all been caught on camera, by the way. . Here’s a short clip you can watch for yourself… . I’d bet 99.9% of investors lost money that day. . But a small group of folks who read my research actually had a chance to make 57% in a matter of days. . Do that once a month… and you could turn a tiny retirement account of $5,000 into a $1.1 million retirement fortune… . Within a year! . Imagine if that happens to you! . For most people, it would take years to see those kinds of gains. . But when you prepare for the “unthinkable,” you can make a fortune in a matter of days… . Even if the markets are collapsing and most people are losing money. . Something similar happened when I predicted Trump’s victory on live TV. . The so-called experts were giving Hillary a 98% chance of winning right up until election night. . So to say my prediction was controversial is a huge understatement. . You can actually see how my prediction shocked the TV anchors in the 1-minute clip below. . Please, understand… . I’m not telling you all this to brag. . But I want you to realize that there’s another BIG event coming on June 30th, 2020… . And depending on what you do… . This event could either help you secure a comfortable retirement once and for all… . Or condemn you to spend your “golden years” struggling to pay for food, medicine and even the most basic necessities. . Again, it all depends on how you act in the next days. . I also think it’s important you realize my predictions are not just “educated” guesses. . They’re based on VERIFIED facts! . Facts that are normally ignored by the “fake news” mainstream media. . The plan you’re about to see, for example, has even been confirmed by members of the global elite. . And I have all the internal “smoking gun” memos to prove it. (You’ll see them in a moment.) . In Short, Come June 30th, 2020… I Fully Expect the Global Elite to Implement a MAJOR Change to the Plumbing of Our Financial System . It’s a brand-new worldwide banking system called Distributed Ledger Technology. . And it will have a huge impact on seniors who are now preparing for retirement… . It will impact your IRA or 401(k)… . Checking and savings account… . And any cash you have parked in the US financial system. . Unfortunately, Trump CANNOT stop this. . There will be nothing the White House can do. . They have no direct control over the institutions that will carry this out. . Nobody can stop this. . It’s already too late. . The global elites’ plan is in motion… and my research indicates this new system will be rolled out on June 30th. . Once it goes live, here’s what I expect to happen… . ***Under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global elites will use that new financial system to replace the US dollar with their own globalist currency. . This new currency will be off limits to everyday folks. . But I found a “loophole” that allows you to take a direct stake on this new globalist currency. . And come June 30th, this currency could explode higher… making you a small fortune. . I’ll show you this incredible opportunity in just a moment. . But that’s not all. . ***With the globalist currency replacing the dollar, demand for Treasury bonds will dry up… cutting the US government’s main source of funding. . We’ll see major disruptions in welfare programs. . &nbsp; . Look, even if I’m wrong you should know that the Wall Street Journal recently reported that… . &nbsp; . “Social Security’s costs are expected to exceed its income in 2020 for the first time since 1982.” . &nbsp; . But you won’t have to worry… . Because in just a few minutes I’m going to show you a unique opportunity that could pay YOU $1,000 or more every month… . Regardless of what happens to the government. . And no, this has nothing to do with dividend stocks, bonds, REITs, selling puts or any other income strategy you might have heard before. . ***This event coming on as soon as June 30th could also set up a huge opportunity in the stock market. . With the new globalist currency replacing the US dollar as the world reserve currency… . And the government struggling to pay its bills, investors will bail out of the stock market… . If you target the right moves, you could walk away wealthier than ever before. . I’m talking about the potential to turn a small retirement account of $10,000 into $193,500… . Using a trade opportunity most people don’t even know is possible. . Of course, you won’t hear any of this from the “fake news” mainstream media. . But the IMF, which is coordinating this entire thing, has even issued a memo. . If You’re Looking for Smoking-Gun Proof, It Doesn’t Get Any Better Than This . The memo clearly states: . “Distributed Ledgers have recently emerged as a key technology supporting multiple applications. The potential exists to transform payments and securities settlement… by offering currency substitutes.” . Look, for years the global elites have been quietly laying the groundwork to replace the US dollar with their own globalist currency. . With this new infrastructure called Distributed Ledgers… . They finally have everything they need to EXECUTE their plan. . I realize most people have never heard of this new global banking system. . But thanks to my network, I’m privy to the details of this plan. . You see, over the last four decades I’ve built an extensive network of who’s who in the financial elite… . From former congressmen, like Ron Paul… to heads of central banks, like Ben Bernanke… to US Treasury officials… foreign ministers… all the way to the White House. . For example, I PERSONALLY know the head of the Distributed Ledger lobbying group. . And thanks to my contacts… . I’ve gathered internal documents that PROVE global elites are preparing to use this new financial system. . The IMF has even set up a special task force. . And they’ve been meeting behind closed doors to discuss the details. . Here’s a “leaked” photo of their last meeting… . And it’s not just me saying this… . Barbara C., a former US Treasury Department attaché to the European Union, was able to infiltrate one of those internal IMF discussions… . And she was stunned with what she heard. She said: . “If the world seeks to diversify away from the US dollar, then [Distributed Ledgers] could initiate for the IMF an entirely different type of construction project.” . Another member of the global elite, Carl T., confirmed that “there’s much anticipation surrounding Distributed Ledger technology.” . Their intentions couldn’t be clearer. . They’ve already laid out the plan… . They’ve set up a special task force… . And now that Trump is in power, they’re ready to pull the trigger! . Globalists Are Already Preparing to Blame All the Chaos on Trump . It’s no secret the global elites hate President Trump. . His nationalistic agenda is the exact opposite of the globalists’ hidden agenda of world government, world money and world taxation. . Trump believes in “America first,” not globalism… . He believes in immigration control, not open borders. . He said himself… . “There is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I’m representing.” . That’s why he already pulled our nation out of the globalists’ international trade deal known as TPP… . And defied global elites by pulling out of their Paris climate accord. . Put simply, Trump is a major threat to the global elites’ agenda. . And now they have the perfect plan to stop him. . With Distributed Ledgers, I fully expect them to finally implement their plan to replace the US dollar with their own globalist currency… . And blame all the chaos on Trump. . In fact, the “fake news” mainstream media already started to lay the groundwork for blaming Trump. . The U.K. Independent newspaper published an article saying: . “The great dollar crisis… will follow the banking crisis and the Great Recession&nbsp;— and it will all be sparked by The Donald.” . Even The Wall Street Journal is playing the blame game. . They wrote: “Could the new president bring forward the day the dollar loses its reserve-currency status?” . The Journal actually quoted me in that specific article. . I had to explain to them that global elites are the real threat to America… . NOT Trump policies. . As you’re about to see, the global elites have been working on this plan to dethrone the dollar for years. . It just so happens now they have the perfect scapegoat to execute their plan. . It’s Their Chance to END America’s “Exorbitant Privilege” . You see, many economists thought our massive government debt would trigger a dollar crisis. . But they’ve been proven wrong again, again and again. . Have you noticed that our debt has been exploding for years… . And yet, nothing has happened to the US dollar? . The reason is simple… . The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency. . That means other nations have to hold and use the US dollar for international trade, instead of their own currencies. . This creates a virtually unlimited demand for US dollars… . And it allows us to print trillions of dollars each year to pay for wars, debt and anything we want. . Basically, it’s a license to print money and abuse the global system. . And that’s why we’ve been able to accumulate more than $19 trillion in debt without suffering any consequences. . As long as there’s no alternative to the US dollar, we can keep doing that forever. . Look, our nation had an amazing run with the US dollar as the #1 reserve currency. . Because of it, we have the world’s best technology… . The word’s most influential culture… . The world’s most powerful military… . We were able to build a true empire with seemingly unlimited control of the world. . But that’s precisely why global elites are sick of the US dollar. . How do you think the other 190+ nations feel about the fact we can print a $100 bill anytime we want… . While they actually have to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain the same bill? . Global elites are sick of what has been called America’s “exorbitant privilege.” . And now they’re finally taking action to&nbsp;“fix”&nbsp;this problem. . For years, they’ve been working on a plan to replace the US dollar with their own globalist currency. . What’s different this time is… they finally have the tool they need to execute their plan. . Let me prove it to you… . My Predictions on the Globalist Currency Have Been Confirmed . Over the last couple of years I’ve been all over TV… from Fox News to CNBC, CNN and Bloomberg… . Telling Americans that the financial global elite was planning to issue their own globalist currency called SDRs. . And that they would use this new currency to REPLACE the US dollar as the global reserve currency. . I’ve even written about this extensively in my best-selling books The Road to Ruin and The New Case for Gold. . I’m sure some people in the mainstream media thought I was crazy… . But the United Nations and the IMF have both CONFIRMED this plan to replace the US dollar is real. . The UN said we need “a new global reserve system… that no longer relies on the United States dollar as the single major reserve currency.” . And the IMF admitted they want to make “the special drawing right (SDR) the principal reserve asset in the [International Monetary System].” . More recently, they advanced their plan by helping private institutions, such as the UK’s Standard Chartered Bank, issue bonds in SDRs. . Although our mainstream media ignored this major event, the UK media reported: . This is all happening. . I fully expect Distributed Ledgers go live late June. . That’s why I’m saying you should get in before June 30th, 2020… . This trend will accelerate… . And many other nations will be able to dump the US dollar for SDRs. . Look, you don’t need to be an economist to connect the dots here. . But let me sum it all up for you… . Fact #1 — The IMF issues a globalist currency called SDRs. . Fact #2 — The IMF has confirmed they want to replace the US dollar with SDRs. . Fact #3 — The IMF has confirmed Distributed Ledgers can be used for “currency substitution”… and they’ve even set up a special task force. . Why do you think they’re so interested in Distributed Ledgers? . The IMF wouldn&#39;t be looking at this technology to create a dollar payment system. . They&#39;d be looking at it to create an SDR payment system, because that&#39;s the currency they issue. . Remember this picture of the task force I showed you earlier? Take a look again… . See that woman at the center? . That’s Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF. . When asked about the task force, she said: . “As I see it, all this amounts to a brave new world for the financial sector.” . Yes, a brave new world where the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency. . Barbara C., a former US Treasury Department attaché to the European Union, has reached the same conclusion. . She said the link between the globalists’ currency and Distributed Ledgers “is impossible to avoid.” . And that “the IMF seems to be exploring the possibility of permitting a broader use of [their globalist currency] beyond internal transactions among member central banks.” . Make no mistake… . The IMF is planning to use Distributed Ledgers to replace the US dollar with SDRs. . And just to be clear… . SDRs will NOT be available to everyday folks like you. . It’s not something you can have in your wallet. . Instead, you’ll be left with devalued dollars. . But I found a “loophole” that allows you to take a stake in this exciting new currency. . Just remember, you must act before June 30th, 2020… . Because Once This Plan Goes Live… It Could Seriously Affect Your Retirement Plans . That means if you’re older than 60, you only have a few days to prepare. . Once this plan goes live, I’m afraid you’ll no longer be able to retire comfortably. . You see, once other nations start accumulating the globalist currency through Distributed Ledgers… . They will no longer need to hold dollars. . And that will have a DIRECT impact on welfare programs. . When we buy things from other nations, like textiles, electronics, etc… . We pay them in US dollars. . And what do they do with that money? . They can’t use it in their own economies. So most of them invest in Treasury bonds. . And that’s exactly how our government finances its operations… . By issuing Treasury bonds to other nations. . Once Distributed Ledgers go live, other nations will no longer need to buy Treasury bonds. . And that means our government will no longer be able to finance its normal operations, including welfare programs. . I showed you how some private banks have already started to issue SDR bonds. . That process will accelerate once Distributed Ledgers go live… . With many other nations dumping US Treasury bonds in exchange for SDR bonds… . Essentially cutting the funding of the US government… including welfare programs. . But don’t worry… . In just a moment, I’ll show you a unique way of getting $1,000 or more a month with this special opportunity… . But That’s Not the Only Looming Opportunity... Here’s an Easy Way to Turn $10,000 Into $193,500 . If you have your retirement account parked in stocks, you could watch it evaporate in a matter of days… . Because the weakest companies in the stock market could collapse once this plan goes live. . Just look what happened the last time we had a big change in our global financial system. . In 1971 Nixon announced the US would no longer officially trade dollars for gold. . That created a lot of uncertainties, turning that decade into a nightmare for stock investors. . Take a look… the Dow Jones, an index of “stable” blue chip stocks (the kind most retirees like to hold), was cut in half! . Stock investors bailed out of the market and, for the most part, didn&#39;t come back for a decade. . I expect something similar once Distributed Ledgers go live. . Because the transition from a US dollar system to a new system dominated by SDRs will be messy. . Stocks will collapse… and will stay down. . There will be no recovery this time. . Because the US government won’t be able to come to the rescue, like they did in 2008. . They won’t even have funding for normal operations… . Let alone to save stock investors. . But don’t worry. . If you target the weakest companies out there, you could come out on the other side wealthier than ever. . In just a moment, I’m going to lay out a 3-step plan to help you secure a comfortable retirement. . With this plan, you’ll be able to… . Be one of the few Americans with a stake in the new world reserve currency, the SDR | Collect an extra $1,000 or more a month, no matter what happens to the Government. | And make as much as $293,000 during the next stock market crash | . But before we get to those solutions… . Let me explain exactly how Distributed Ledgers work… . The IMF-Led Currency Coup… Revealed . As I mentioned before, most international financial transactions are conducted in the US dollar... . And that means they must pass through the US banking system’s network. . This gives the US government an incredible amount of power. . They can not only see all the transactions, but stop, trace or freeze them. . For example, in 2014 the Obama administration fined French bank BNP Paribas $9 billion because they did business with Cuba and Iran. . The bank didn’t break any French laws. . But the US government threatened to kick them out of the US banking system if they didn’t pay the fee. . Since the US dollar plays such a key role in international trade… . Being kicked out of the US banking system is like a death sentence. . As long as the US dollar remains the world’s dominant reserve currency… . International financial institutions must be able to clear and settle US dollar transactions if they want to remain in business. . That’s why French bank BNP Paribas paid the fee. . Something similar happened with Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, Germany’s Commerzbank and Switzerland’s UBS, among others. . But what if global elites could set up another network beyond the reach of the US government… . And What if Other Countries Could Use That Network to Settle Their Transactions in SDRs, Instead of the US Dollar? . That’s exactly what Distributed Ledger technology is all about. . It’s a new financial technology to clear and settle international financial transactions. . With this distributed system, America will no longer have a stranglehold over the world’s international finance system. . It allows foreign banks and other institutions to conduct transactions in SDRs instead of dollars… . And transfer funds across international borders without using America’s payment system. . You see, for years the IMF has been planning to replace the US dollar with SDRs… . But they didn’t have the infrastructure necessary to make that happen. . They didn’t have a decentralized payment system that could facilitate wide adoption of SDRs. . Now they do! . With a Distributed Ledger, it will be much easier for other nations to dump the US dollar and replace it with SDRs. . Since this is an untraceable, encrypted ledger… . Countries like China and Russia will be able to invest in SDR bonds… and the US government will never know. . It’s totally outside America’s control. . And because it’s a Distributed Ledger, there’s no choke point we can control. . That means we can’t stop it. . Remember, this is all part of the global elites’ agenda of world government, world money, and world taxation. . They’re going for the jugular… . Because they know replacing the US dollar with their globalist currency is the ultimate way to transfer power from the US to the global elites. . Don’t get me wrong… . Your dollars in your wallet or bank account won’t disappear from circulation. . When global elites make that switch… . That new globalist currency will NOT trickle down to you and me. . It will remain at the top of the system, in the vaults of central banks, monetary agencies and global corporations. . You won’t have SDRs in your wallet. . Instead, we&#39;ll be left with near worthless dollars for everyday transactions. . The dollar will become just a local currency… no different than the Mexican peso. . Just like Mexican pesos are good only in Mexico… . The US dollar will be good only in America. . They won’t be good anywhere else because other nations will NOT need them. . Since they will be using SDRs instead. . Like I mentioned earlier, retirees on fixed incomes will be hit the hardest… . Because we’ll see major disruptions in welfare programs. . Most seniors will end up on the breadlines… . But there’s no reason you have to join them. . If you take the 3 steps I outline below before June 30th, you can watch your portfolio soar… . Even when almost everyone else’s is crashing around you. . STEP ONE: The Only Way I Know of Investing in the Globalist Currency . Betting on currencies during political events is one of the quickest ways to make a fortune. . For example, when the UK voted to leave the European Union (the so-called Brexit)… . Investors who bet against the British pound made a fortune. . Crispin O., a hedge fund tycoon, made more than $268 million. . Something similar happened when the Swiss government decided to devalue its currency… . Thomas S., another hedge fund manager, pocketed $120 million in one day. . And, of course, we’ve all heard of George Soros’ legendary trade betting against the pound in the 1990s… . He made a cool $1 billion in one day. . But here’s the thing… . All those trades were practically off limits to everyday folks like you and me… . For two reasons… . First, they required complicated transactions in the forex market. . And second, they were extremely hard to predict. . Which is why I’m so excited with today’s opportunity. . I found a “loophole” that allows you to own an “unofficial” stake in the future world reserve currency. . It’s 100% legal… . It doesn’t require you to open a forex account… . And it doesn’t require a lot of money to get started. . That means anyone can open this trade. . Plus, unlike those situations I described above… . This trade is totally predictable. . Because I fully expect this plan to go live on as soon as June 30th, 2020. . As I said, once a Distributed Ledger goes live… . The globalist currency will NOT trickle down to everyday folks like you and me. . It will stay at the top… and it will be exclusive to the financial elite ONLY. . And yet, once this new currency takes over as the world’s top form of reserve cash… . The few who have access to it could make an incredible fortune. . And I happen to have the only private link in the world that will get you in. . You’ll find this link inside a private intelligence dossier called The Only Way to Own the New World Money. . I’d like to send you a copy right now. . I’ll tell you how you can get it in just a moment… . Inside it shows you exactly how this works. . It couldn’t be easier. . It’s a little-known kind of account that gives you an advance stake in the rise of “new money” bank reserves. . And it’s the only way I know of for any private citizen to get access to the globalist currency. . And you can do it right now… before a Distributed Ledger goes live. . I recommend you get in as soon as possible… . Because I’m afraid after June 30th, it will be too late. . Members of the global elite will pile up in this new currency, pushing its price way higher. . The time to get in is now. . All you need is the private web link that gets you started. . Only a tiny number of people in the world happen to have it. I’m one of them. . I’d like to share it with you today… . I don’t get a commission or anything for sharing it with you. Even still, I’ll show you exactly how to set up this special “world money” account, for maximum exposure to any gains. . After that, you can rebalance your assets in this account however and whenever you see fit. There are no money managers involved. . You’ll have complete control of this special account. . And I’ll have the complete satisfaction of knowing you’re ready to preserve your wealth — and possibly collect a fat double-digit return — ahead of the “world money” deadline. . It’s that simple. . Because every American citizen deserves to get a piece of what could be a really explosive currency move. . I’ll send this private link to you… and explain how to use it… in your copy of this intelligence dossier, The Only Way to Own the New World Money. . STEP TWO: How to Turn a Small Retirement Account of $10,000 Into a $193,500 Fortune… in a Matter of Months . While most authorities were oblivious to the train wreck in 2008... . I saw the collapse coming a mile away. . In a 2005 presentation at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School, I warned the audience a new financial catastrophe was coming. . In late 2007, I told a US Treasury official that what we were watching at the time was just the beginning of a systemic collapse. . In the summer of 2008, I sent a letter to Congressmen warning them to prepare for a “panic spike in October 2008.” . Unfortunately, three weeks later I was proven right. . While most investors lost everything, it didn’t have to be that way. . Because if you had placed one single trade, you could have actually walked away with a small fortune. . See, in a crash there are always two sides… . The victims who do nothing and lose everything. . And the vultures who see what’s coming, and use the crash to profit. . In the next market crash, I want you to be a vulture, like me… . In my own career, I’ve used this system to pocket gains as high as 3,000% when shares of telecommunications giant WorldCom collapsed. . You can do the same by targeting the weakest companies in the market. . Let me prove it to you… . Take a look at what happened with company OSI Systems in 2008. . It lost more than half of its value in a little more than two months. . Had you placed one simple trade, you could have turned that crash into a 1,786% gain. . That’s more than 17 times your money… . Enough to turn $1,000 into $18,860. . All in a little more than two months. . Or look at American Outdoor Brands Corp. . Its investors were ruined when shares crashed 86% in 2008. . But with one simple trade, you could have turned $1,000 into $23,200. . Invest $5,000, and now you’re looking at a payout of $116,000! . Or look at giant casino operator Las Vegas Sands. . In 2007 the clueless mainstream media thought the company had “seemingly unlimited growth prospects in Macau, the most lucrative gambling market in the world.” . Shares were trading at nearly $150 at the time. . But with all the turmoil in 2008, shares dropped all the way to $1.50. . A crash of 99%! . The company almost went bankrupt. . But had you placed one simple trade during that bloodbath… . You could have made an incredible 2,839% gain… . Enough to turn $1,000 into $29,390… . $5,000 into $146,950… . And $10,000 into $193,500! . Can you see now how easy this can be? . Targeting weak companies during a crash is the quickest and most predictable way of making a fortune. . And to help you get started, my team and I have already done all the homework for you. . We’ve identified three companies you can target right now by placing a simple trade. . You’ll find all the details on how to profit from these three companies inside your report How to Turn $10,000 Into a $193,500 Fortune. . I’ll tell you how you can claim it in a moment. But first… . STEP THREE: How to Get as Much as $1,000 or More… Every Month… Regardless of What Happens to the Government . As I mentioned before, once the global elites’ plan goes live, it could have a huge impact on American seniors. . I fully expect to see major disruptions in government welfare programs. . Which is why it’s important you find other sources of income. . Look, the average Social Security benefit is just $1,461 a month. . Do you really want that to be your only source of income in retirement? . Do you think that would cover rent or mortgage, medical bills, traveling and other living expenses in your golden years? . Look at medical costs for example… . According to HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software… . A 65-year-old couple in good health will need $387,644 to pay for health-care costs for the remainder of their lives. . That’s why Forbes says… . “Say you want to stop working at 65. You’re in good health and your family tends toward long lives. You expect to reach 90, having been retired for 25 years. . Will Social Security alone be enough? Probably not.” . Those who rely exclusively on Social Security will almost certainly end up on the breadlines. . And that’s why I’d like to tell you about a unique way you could generate as much as $1,000 or more every month… almost effortlessly. . That might not sound like a lot… . But wouldn’t you like to have $1,000 deposited into your account every month? . Even better… . You can get started with as little as $5.50… with a click of a mouse. . And no, this is not a dividend-paying stock… not bonds… not selling puts… not rental income… . Or any other income strategy you might have heard before. . Even though most people have never heard of this opportunity… . It couldn’t be easier. . Because you can get started directly from your retirement account. . And once you “sign up,” you’ll watch that cash get deposited in your account every month. . That means just a few days from now… . You could be getting $1,000 or more deposited into your account. . I’ve put all the details inside another intelligence report called How to Get $1,000 or More a Month… Regardless of What Happens to the Government. . Just keep in mind there is no such thing as a risk-free investment. And that past performance is no guarantee of future return. . Altogether that gives you three powerful ways to protect yourself. . You’re getting a way to profit from the new world reserve currency… . To make as much as $193,500 by targeting the weakest companies in the market… . And the chance to get $1,000 every month, regardless of what happens to the Government. . And all before June 30th. . That’s a lot of my best research. . And With Your Permission, I’ll Send You a Copy of Everything I’ve Mentioned So Far . That’s right… . I’m offering to send it to you right now. . No questions asked and yours to keep. . You see, even though I constantly appear on everything from CNBC to Fox and CNN… . Those venues don’t allow me to share the most sensitive moneymaking moves with regular folks like you. . And that’s important, because today we have a very urgent situation… . After June 30th, 2020, I’m afraid those who don’t prepare will never be able to retire comfortably. . The retirement window will slam shut forever. . With that in mind, I’d like to help you navigate what’s coming… . And guide you on an ongoing basis as this new plan is implemented… . Recommending to you where to invest and how to avoid the pitfalls. . That’s why I’m inviting you to take a risk-free trial of Jim Rickards’ Strategic Intelligence. . My mission in this monthly research is simple… . To help everyday folks profit from “unthinkable” events and financial crisis. . Until now, I have only provided this kind of service to my high-net-worth clients and members of the US intelligence community. . But with Rickards’ Strategic Intelligence, you too will have the opportunity to hear my best ideas on an ongoing basis. . And it’s important to note, this will be the exclusive place to receive my monthly issues and alerts. . This letter will not be available anywhere else in the world, at any price. . Once you agree to a risk-free trial of this exclusive new letter… . I’ll send you everything I mentioned today… FREE of charge. . As soon as you claim this FREE package, you’ll also gain access to my Strategic Intelligence Video Series. . It’s a 10-part welcome series of videos where I answer all the questions you need to know to get up to speed. . Think of it like a “fast track” introduction course you can watch even before you start reading my letter and intelligence reports. . With all this material, I’m confident you’ll be able to protect and grow your wealth in the coming years… . No matter what happens with our economy. . But don&#39;t take my word for it. . Here’s What Some of My Readers Are Saying . “Thank you so much for all of the investment advice you have provided in Strategic Intelligence. I have found that your analysis of the economy and your investment advice stand head and shoulders above the rest.” Geoffrey C. . “I can sleep better at night knowing when the s*** hits the fan, I will be making money and not one of the people scrambling to make it day to day.” Patrick N. . “There are only a couple of analysts I follow who really understand what’s happening and Jim Rickards is at the top of that list. He’s the most intelligent and connected person I have access to. I look forward to each [issue] and find myself in awe of almost every word.” Ken D. . “I have recommended Strategic Intelligence to my friends and family because it’s information everyone should know about. It’s worth its weight in gold.” Bill P. . “Just one minute of time listening to Jim would convince anybody to sign up for his incredible insight.” Todd W. . “Jim is without question the best financial mind I&#39;ve ever heard. His analysis is complete and, most importantly, understandable. It&#39;s all original, substantive information. In short, I think he is top-notch.” Rodney S. . “I am more secure knowing that someone much more experienced and intelligent than me recognizes just how thin the ice is... the Fed, debt, deflation, inflation, the dollar, etc., and yet offers hope in preparing for the inevitable. I have taken advantage of several recommendations and recently profited nicely from the DXJ play.” John B. . “His analysis of world events has been spot on and diametrically opposite to what you see in the major media outlets.” Isaac J. . “He is one of the few experts around that I don&#39;t walk away feeling there was hidden agenda. I truly believe he simply wants people to prepare for what’s in front of us.” David C. . “Very concrete financial information. The investments Jim recommends are proven winners that increase over time even in this economic malaise we find ourselves in. I feel Jim would not recommend anything that he would not invest in himself. His track record speaks for itself.” Veronica J. . “I have benefited from Strategic Intelligence beyond my imagination. The information Jim Rickards provides is like none I have read anywhere.” Brad O. . “The recommendations are perfect and spot on!” Susan S. . “You get an insider&#39;s perspective, you get to know what the elites are doing so you can protect yourself just like the families who have kept wealth for generations. And he makes the complex financial inner workings of central banks, governments, hedge funds, and financial institutions incredibly simple to understand. We now have the tools we need to stay ahead of the game.” Chris C. . “I am impressed with Jim&#39;s network of contacts among the leaders in the banking world as well as the intelligence community. I&#39;m grateful that he has decided to help those of us who don&#39;t have that kind of network to understand what’s really going on behind the scenes.” Paul A. . I’m happy that my work is already helping many everyday folks protect and grow their wealth. . And I’m confident it could help you too. . Others have paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars for my advisory services. . But don’t worry… . Rickards’ Strategic Intelligence is not going to cost anywhere near that.

To enable a color scheme, set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . Example . # Color scheme currently only supports &quot;dark&quot; or nil (default) color_scheme: &quot;dark&quot; . Preview dark color scheme . Specific visual customization . To customize your site’s aesthetic, open _sass/custom/custom.scss in your editor to see if there is a variable that you can override. Most styles like fonts, colors, spacing, etc. are derived from these variables. To override a specific variable, uncomment its line and change its value. . For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, open _sass/custom/custom.css and find the $link-color variable on line 50. Uncomment it, and change its value to our $blue-000 variable, or another shade of your choosing. . Example . // ... // // $body-text-color: $grey-dk-100; // $body-heading-color: $grey-dk-300; $link-color: $blue-000; // // ... . Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. . Override styles . For styles that aren’t defined as a variables, you may want to modify specific CSS classes. To add your own CSS overrides at the end of the cascade, edit _sass/overrides.scss. This will allow for all overrides to be kept in a single file, and for any upstream changes to still be applied. . For example, if you’d like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles. . Example . // Print-only styles. @media print { .side-bar, .page-header { display: none; } .main-content { max-width: auto; margin: 1em;} } .",

We’ve grown many companies using the techniques described in this book. As evidence of how powerful the techniques are&mdash;and how they can be applied to any business&mdash;below are some quotes taken from our website from clients we’ve helped over the last ten years. . Tom Leung from Google described how we achieve “really extraordinary ‘off-the-chart’ results.” (We have worked with Google on several projects, including the launch of Google’s first Android phone.) . | Sean Ellis, who was Dropbox’s first marketer and is the author of the book Hacking Growth, commented that “Conversion Rate Experts are by far the most advanced group in conversion rate optimization that I’ve ever worked with.” . | . The founder of MyFitnessPal said, “We’ve seen more than 4x increases in conversion rate on some pages.” . | Vodafone talked about how we “increased our conversion rate by 300%.” . | Jenny Craig remarked on how we generated about “$10 million of increased potential revenue.” . | Rand Fishkin said, “Our conversion rate is up 170% in four months.” . | SimpliSafe described getting “a five-fold increase” in their business. . | PayPal said we are “the best in the business.” . | . Near the end of this book, we have included many more inspiring examples of businesses we’ve grown using CRO. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-5&quot;&gt; Foreword by Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist, Google . If you ask “why experiment” to people who live and champion experimentation, they’ll answer that it allows decisions to be based on data. This is true. . Or, they may tell you that it allows you to get answers fast, without needing to have long debates with your team. This is also true. . Or, you’ll hear that, because one never knows exactly who the visitor is, it is difficult to anticipate the visitors’ expectations&mdash;and hence why not let an n-variable multivariate experiment figure out the best solution for each type of visitor. This is especially true. . Or, you’ll hear a string of explanations around statistics, confidence intervals, and significance&mdash;that a business should be improved with the same discipline and control that would be applied to most feats of manufacturing and engineering. I like this; why not overcome all human barriers via brute force math! :-) . The above reasons are certainly exciting and contribute to why I champion experimentation. They are not at the core, though. . I see experimentation as a solution to a set of pernicious problems with business culture. I am heartbroken about the power dynamic in most organizations, where decisions are based not on customer needs but the opinions of the person with the most senior job title. (In a speech in 2006, I framed this as HiPPO-driven decision-making&mdash;HiPPO standing for the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion.) Experimentation reduces that power dynamic with amazing results. . In addition, I deeply believe in heuristic evaluations, in which a broad cross section of company employees use a website or mobile app as customers. Heuristic evaluations create a democracy of ideas, capturing insights from beyond the User Experience team and Digital team. The only way to allow this democracy to thrive is to build an experimentation model&mdash;to put all the ideas through testing. . In my experience, most companies operate as if the world is static. As if tastes don’t change, preferences don’t evolve, and disruptive competitors don’t show up. In reality, change is the only constant. Experimentation assumes this is true and fosters a culture of mental agility that constantly explores boundaries (and pushes against them). . Finally, most people and companies are risk-averse. What I love the most about experimentation is that it allows us to accommodate for the short-term risk we are willing to tolerate. You may be deeply shy, your company may be a cash cow, and even the slightest change to the ecosystem may mean death, but that’s no problem. Experimentation allows you to dial-in the level of risk you want to take (you may even choose to show a test to only a small fraction of your visitors). On the other hand, if you realize that taking bold risks is the only way to protect your confident position in the market, then experimentation allows you to execute precisely that&mdash;to learn and keep kicking butt! . It’s about leveraging experimentation to influence a shift in culture, as we all know culture eats strategy for breakfast. . That is the reason you should buy this lovingly crafted book. The deep and broad digital experience Karl and Ben have accumulated in their years of practice is reflected in every chapter. . The book is broken into easily digestible chunks. Section One is best shared with every boss who stands in your way. Section Two will help you quickly set up the foundations on which your ideas democracy can flower. Section Three will give you a lifetime of ideas that will fuel the fundamental shift you are trying to accomplish. . If you are standing in a bookstore wondering if you want to buy this book, jump to the section about how “Winning websites…manage complexity” and scan Step&nbsp;7. Then rush to the cashier to check out. . A culture of experimentation has benefits that far surpass “this button is better than that” or “this offer is better than that.” . Solve for culture and your career will never be the same again. . Carpe diem! .

Most websites lose. Almost all of them. . Many of them never make a profit. Like chocolate teapots, they look nice but flop as soon as you pour hot customers into them. . Others are successful at first, and then get pushed out of business by their competitors. . This book is about how to buck the trend, to make websites that customers love and that are outrageously profitable. . It has the ability to transform your business and your career. Really. That’s an extraordinary claim&mdash;and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. . So here goes: . 1. This book is based on experimentally proven facts&mdash;not theory . Have you ever looked at a company’s marketing materials and wondered, “Does this really make people buy?” . We have. And in 2005, we began a quest to find out for certain. . One of us, Ben, was running the website for a company that sold phones for travelers. The other, Karl, was a Cambridge PhD scientist. Together, we discussed how we’d be able to carry out scientific experiments on the website. . We’d change a page and then measure&mdash;via an A/B test&mdash;whether our new version had increased (or decreased) the company’s sales. . The results were astonishing. Within a year, we managed to triple&mdash;to $9 million&mdash;the sales of the company&mdash;even though the worldwide demand for travel phones was decreasing by 15% per year. . . Sales went through the roof the first time we applied A/B testing to a company. Rather than rescaling the axes, we drew on the wall, hoping to penetrate the ceiling tiles. (Those dashed lines represent interim forecasts we kept beating.) . In doing so, we began to build a database of what works (and what doesn’t). . Since then, we have applied the same methodology to hundreds of companies. Double- and triple-digit improvements have been the norm, and many of the companies have won awards for fast growth. With each success (and failure), we update our database of what works. And each time an activity turns out to be fruitful (or fruitless), we adjust our methodology accordingly. . In this book, we have distilled many of the most successful ones&mdash;the activities and strategies that most reliably grow a business. . It’s exciting to have the power to walk into any business and be able to permanently, dramatically, and measurably grow its sales&mdash;all without having to leave the building. Most salespeople dream of being able to do that. . You see, the majority of web design and copywriting is still in the pre-scientific age. The average webpage was designed less scientifically than the average toilet brush. Most web designers rely on inspiration, not experimentation. They are oblivious to what works and what doesn’t. They violate proven principles. . By the time you finish this book, you’ll know what works in web design. You’ll know how to write copy that works. And you’ll be able to easily spot the mistakes in any webpage&mdash;or, indeed, in any marketing materials. . 2. The techniques in this book are teachable . On the strength of our success with the travel phone company, we published an article about the approach we had developed. It immediately went viral. That week, according to the statistics service Alexa.com, our website was the third fastest growing in the world. . The following day, we received an email out of the blue from one of Google’s senior managers, who invited us to become the first worldwide consulting partner for Google’s testing tool. . And so our company, Conversion Rate Experts, was born. . At the time, hardly anyone was doing this type of marketing. (We even gave it a name: conversion rate optimization, or CRO.) . As we grew, we hired new team members. We discovered that the most successful ones were readers of our blog. So we continued to publish valuable articles with the ulterior motive that each one attracted both clients and new team members. . Plus, every time we published an article, we received emails from people telling us how it had helped them to grow their businesses. . This book is a compilation of the most useful of those articles. For the first time, they are organized in an order that allows you to quickly become great at conversion. Importantly, the book teaches you the right mental models, so your understanding of conversion will be deep and intuitive. . Of course, there’s a limit to what a book can achieve. A book about songwriting won’t turn you into Paul McCartney, and a book about CRO&mdash;even a dense one like this&mdash;won’t make you great at conversion overnight. However, it does contain ample information to generate millions for a company. . The best conversion practitioners are like sponges, obsessed with learning. (Which, come to think of it, sponges aren’t. Who came up with that analogy?) . 3. This book works whatever your situation . This book is about universal truths. We have yet to find a business for which the techniques in this book don’t apply. We have applied our methodology to pretty much all kinds of websites: . In thirty-seven countries worldwide: Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominica, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and United States . | In eleven languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, and Swedish . | For companies of all sizes&mdash;from startups to large enterprises . | In business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) . | In more than eighty industry verticals, including finance, health, retail, travel, technology, leisure, and food (you name it, we’ve sold it) . | With different types of product: selling physical goods, services, software, and information . | With all types of business: merchants, affiliates, publishers, social networks, e-commerce and lead-generation websites . | In many media and formats: desktop websites, mobile websites, native mobile apps, email marketing, offline advertising, and more . | . This book is useful for whatever job role you have: . If you are creating your first website, and you are hoping that it will drive results (rather than just be a brochure website), then this book will help you to understand what the pages need to say&mdash;which is much more important than how the pages are created. . | If you are a web designer or marketing executive, this book will give you key skills and resources to make websites that beat their competitors and dominate their market. . | If you are a CEO or in senior management, this book will reveal the key activities on which your team should be concentrating. . | . In short, the skills you learn from this book will work for you now, and for whatever you do next. . 4. What you will&mdash;and won’t&mdash;get from this book (this book focuses on improving websites&mdash;because that’s what the most successful web businesses do) . In the 1990s, websites were designed for designers, whose goals were typically (1)&nbsp;to use the project as an opportunity to learn the technologies (Flash, XML, CSS, and others) and (2)&nbsp;to populate their portfolios to show off their newfound capabilities. It wasn’t uncommon for a website to be impossibly difficult to use. . In 2000, websites were designed for search engines. To get traffic from search engines, webmasters obsessed over search engine optimization (SEO), making websites “search engine friendly.” Unfortunately, the search engines, which were still primitive, accidentally rewarded some practices that were very user-unfriendly, including pages that were stuffed with keywords to the point of being illegible, light gray text on a white background, and “links pages” with endless reciprocal links. . In 2010, websites were designed for companies. Search engines had become less trickable, and so agencies became free to focus on what their clients wanted. And what did the clients want? Well, some of them wanted quirky diagonal navigation bars, some wanted parallax scrolling, and some wanted spinny icons. Others wanted best practices, crammed with marketing techniques and things “borrowed” from competitors. They wanted the kind of thing you see when you browse galleries of website themes. . And that’s where we are today. . However, throughout that period, there were a small number of companies that didn’t follow those trends. These companies, the most successful websites, focused on their customers. Customer-centric design was&mdash;and still is&mdash;surprisingly rare. The websites look nothing like the ones you see in theme galleries. Customers like them, they visit them often, and they spend a lot. Customer-centric, customer-optimized websites are winning. They are the subject of this book. . If you study any one of the winning websites, you’ll find they are built of “engines” of conversion, of perfected landing pages and irresistible offers, of compelling copy and user-friendly interfaces, of viral loops and streamlined order flows. And if you visit the companies themselves, you’ll find that their team members are engineers finely tuning those conversion engines. . Web companies that are struggling, on the other hand, tend to focus on different things. Some of them spend their time on brute-force SEO. Others prioritize pretty web design. Many don’t ever change their websites, because they have created knots of complexity that they can’t change. Of course, those disciplines, and many others, are important. But we find that they become easy when you have created a high-converting website. . So, important as they are, this book will not address many aspects of web design and marketing. You’ll need a different book if you want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO, or advertising. In this book, we encourage you to focus on what’s essential: Creating pages that visitors love and that convert like crazy. If coding is an obstacle for you, you can get great results using this book’s methodology with a website builder tool like SquareSpace, Wix, Shopify, BigCommerce (a former client of ours), WebFlow, LeadPages, Unbounce, ClickFunnels, or PageWiz. Then, imagine how easy it is to get visitors once you have created a website that people love and that has a huge lifetime customer value. Advertising becomes simple when you can afford to outbid all the competition. SEO is a piece of cake when you have a website that people want to link to. . 5. This book works even on the most sophisticated companies . Our clients include many of the world’s most sophisticated web companies. In fact, we believe we have designed pages for more top 500 websites than any other company. This has been both a privilege and a curse. We have been fortunate enough to work with some of the world’s best marketers, and we have had to improve upon some of the world’s most difficult-to-beat pages. . As such, our methodology has had a trial by fire. . We once read an article called something like “100 must-have web analytics reports.” Anyone who’s familiar with the Pareto principle will know that there aren’t 100 must-have anythings. At the end of a project, we ask ourselves the following question: “If we had to repeat that project in one-tenth of the time, what were the vital few activities that were most fruitful? What could we do differently next time?” . This book is about the vital few. . 6. This book works on all marketing materials, not just websites . Even though this book is about optimizing webpages, it’s equally applicable to any content that is important enough to be hyperoptimized. . The techniques can be applied with great success to almost any media, provided it’s important enough to be worth making great. We’ve used it successfully on press releases, marketing email sequences, video scripts, webinars, print ads, Facebook ads, and much more. We’ll use it on whatever media arise next. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-45&quot;&gt; Terminology and other details . Throughout this book, for brevity, we will usually refer to “products” when we mean “products and services.” All of the advice is just as applicable to services. (And we should know&mdash;we sell services.) . We don’t get paid for mentioning or recommending any tools or techniques. . We mention the tools and products of several companies that have been clients of ours. In all cases, we were using and recommending these companies before they became clients. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-27&quot;&gt; Ulterior motives: Why we wrote this book . We wrote this book for two reasons: . Might you be a kindred spirit? . We want this book to be a mechanism for attracting like-minded specialists. Our company mission is to remain the best in the world at CRO&mdash;and that’s a tall order. . You can imagine that people who are proven experts at website creation, copywriting, analytics, marketing research, design, and so on are in great demand and have no problem being happily employed. If you believe you’re world-class at CRO, and you’re up for stiff challenges and high rewards, we’d love to hear from you. . If your company isn’t yet large enough to be our client… . Many of our clients were small when they first started reading our articles. In fact, we often hear from readers who attribute their success to the advice we published. . This book provides you with enough information to more than double the sales of an early stage business. . And, who knows, perhaps one day we will work together. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-66&quot;&gt; What you’ll get from each section . If you want to become an expert in CRO, you’ll probably want to read all of this book. If, on the other hand, you want to carry out CRO for only one project, you can dip in and out of the relevant chapters. . Here’s how this book is structured: . Section 1: The one you’re halfway through reading . In the rest of this section (“Why Most Web Design Is Done Wrong&mdash;and How to Do It Like the Winners”), we define what conversion entails (when it’s done right). We explain why it should be the number-one priority for your company (and for your career)&mdash;as it is for the world’s most successful web companies. We describe The Power Law of CRO and how it can drive a company into an economic “virtuous circle” of growth. This will help you to win the support and enthusiasm of your colleagues. . We also point out the conversion principles that are followed by the top web companies&mdash;the winners&mdash;and that are strikingly absent from most other web companies. . Most people do CRO the wrong way round. They behave like physicians prescribing remedies before having diagnosed the patient. These “malpracticing physicians of marketing” prescribe testimonials, guarantees, and punchy headlines&mdash;and have no idea why the visitors aren’t taking action. We introduce our customer-centric DiPS (Diagnose → Problem → Solution) approach, which thrashes the alternative&mdash;as you’d expect, given that the alternative is so absurd. . Section 2: Diagnosis (the D of DiPS) . In Section 2, (“Diagnosis: Understanding Why Your Visitors Aren’t Converting”), we take you on a grand tour of tools and techniques you can use to diagnose and improve your website’s problems. To overextend the medical analogy, these are the web stethoscopes, landing page thermometers, and the homepage ear-microscope doodads. These techniques will allow you to deeply understand your visitors&mdash;and how they interact with your website. That way, you’ll empathically understand them, and you’ll be able to identify exactly why they aren’t converting into customers. . Section 3: Common problems and solutions (the P and S of DiPS) . Fortunately, there aren’t an infinite number of reasons why visitors don’t convert. In fact, our research has revealed that most websites underperform in just fourteen ways. In Section 3, (“Making Websites Win: The Most Common Problems That Make Web Visitors Abandon&mdash;And Proven, Easy-To-Implement Solutions”) we devote a chapter to each of them. In each chapter, we describe the most effective techniques for getting your website “firing on all fourteen cylinders.” . Section 4: Bringing it all together . In Section 4, we describe a case study of how we helped to grow a financial-technology company by 470% in just a year. We reveal exactly how the steps were carried out, so you can see how the principles and techniques described above come together in practice&mdash;with record-breaking results. . Okay, that’s enough overviewing. It’s time to explain what conversion entails (when done right), and why it should be the number-one priority for your company&mdash;and for your career. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-8&quot;&gt; How we define conversion rate optimization (CRO) . What is a conversion rate? . Your conversion rate is the percentage of your visitors who end up reaching a given goal. This diagram illustrates it: . . The most useful definition of conversion rate is broad. . Two things are worth noting: . The “content” can be any item of messaging or any user interface. Of course, it can be a landing page, but it can also be a checkout page, an explainer video, the warranty application card that comes with a product, an email asking customers to refer their friends, the sales script that a customer service operator uses, a radio ad, … you get the idea. We have optimized all of the above and more. If you restrict yourself to landing pages, you’re going to struggle to triple a company’s sales. . | The “goal” is often to maximize sales&mdash;but not always. The goal of an early-stage social network, for example, may be to acquire new non-paying users. The goal of a knowledge base article may be to minimize the number of customers who need to call customer service, so the call center operatives can have less-hurried cigarette breaks. Always, the goal is to optimize the content for whatever it was created for&mdash;its raison d’etre (that’s French for “raisin for eating.” Who needs Google Translate?). The content exists to do a job, so it must excel at that job. You may think it’s obvious to optimize something for its entire reason for existing. Incredibly, in the world of marketing, it’s vanishingly rare. . | What is A/B testing? . A/B testing is a powerful way to increase conversion rates. Here’s how it works: . If you had two possible headlines for your webpage but couldn’t decide which one to use, you could run an A/B test in which . half of your visitors would see Headline A, and . | the other half would see Headline B. . | . You could then tally the orders for each headline and determine which headline brought you the most. . A/B testing software makes it easy to carry out such tests. Each of your visitors will see a different version of the page&mdash;Version A or Version B, or even Version C, D, or E&mdash;and then the software will work out, on average, which of the elements performed the best. The winner can then be promoted. . In most tests, Version A is the existing version, often called the “control,” which you are trying to beat. . If we were to use A/B testing software on the following page, we could test the following: . . On every webpage, there are many changes you could make to increase your profits. . Powerful, isn&#39;t it? . What is multivariate testing? . Most A/B testing software also allows you to carry out multivariate tests. What are they? . Multivariate tests let you effectively carry out several A/B tests concurrently, so you make the most of your traffic. So while you are testing which headline to use, you could also test other page elements&mdash;such as text, images, prices, offers, and buttons&mdash;all at once. Each visitor will see a different combination of headline, text, images, and buttons. Then, once enough data have been collected, the multivariate testing software will tell you which version of each page element, on average, brought in the most customers. . Throughout this book, we’ll use “A/B testing” as a catch-all term to describe A/B testing, multivariate testing, and any other types of scientifically controlled experiments. . Four huge benefits of A/B testing . When you A/B test, you get the following benefits: . Benefit 1. You get to discard your missteps . Most marketing is based on mere opinions; A/B testing reveals the truth. If a test doesn’t produce a winner, you haven’t lost a thing; you learn from it and discard the losing variation. You certainly don’t keep it, which is what happens in companies that don’t test. . One of our first clients, whose sales we more than tripled, stopped A/B testing after we finished working with it. Its marketing manager then began making radical changes. He persuaded his team that there was no need to A/B test, because the changes were “obviously improvements.” Within a year, the company’s sales had plummeted, and no one in the company knew why. The marketing manager was fired. Had he A/B tested his changes, he wouldn’t have broken the company. . The following story from Microsoft’s Senior Statistician, Roger Longbotham, describes how Microsoft avoided a similar disaster: . We ran an experiment for a site where the management was reluctant to run the test because they considered it a “no-brainer” that the treatment would win. We agreed the value proposition looked quite promising but proceeded with the experiment. The treatment had some unexpected and subtle negative aspects that would not have been detected had we not run the experiment. If the treatment had been launched we estimate the annual loss to the site would have been in the millions of dollars. . Benefit 2. You keep only your successes . If something works, you get to know. So you never accidentally throw away something that works. This process repeats over and over, meaning that only better-performing versions of pages are kept, so your conversion rate (and revenue) can only go up. . . With iterative testing, your profits can only go up&mdash;because you keep only the winners. . Benefit 3. You learn what you should be doing more (and less) of . A/B testing is like a compass: It tells you which direction to move in. One of our clients, a company in the telecom industry, was debating whether to lower the price of its top-selling phone. The phone was already the lowest priced in the marketplace. To measure how price sensitive the company’s visitors were, we A/B tested the existing price against zero dollars (completely free of charge). To everyone’s surprise, the zero-dollar offer didn’t sell more phones. Our research revealed that users were concerned that the free-phone deal was “too good to be true.” Concluding that the visitors weren’t sensitive to the price of the handset, we went in the other direction by A/B testing higher prices. The winning page featured two higher-priced premium versions of the phone alongside the standard product. We then obtained a further win by offering optional upsells including accessories, insurance, call credit, and 24-hour customer support. So not only did A/B testing save the company from pointlessly destroying its margins, but it revealed an unexpected opportunity for growing the profits. . Benefit 4. You never need to make hard decisions . Most companies run according to the following process: . Get Idea → Decide Whether to Implement It → Implement It. . A/B testing allows you to postpone the decision-making until you know the correct answer, at which point the decision is a no-brainer: . Get Idea → Implement It (as a Test) → Decide Whether to Keep It. . A/B testing thus eradicates the laborious decision-making stage, allowing companies to move faster. Endless pontification about “Should we do it?” is replaced with a simple “Let’s test it and find out!” . Testing is the stopwatch; your website is the sprinter . Whichever type of testing you use, the software won’t tell you what to test. . Unfortunately, that’s the most important part. Roger Longbotham said, “What you place upon the statistical framework is what ultimately determines the attractiveness of your test results.” . As with all tools, A/B testing is subject to the equation “GI&nbsp;→&nbsp;GO,” which stands for “Garbage In leads to Garbage Out.” In other words, if you put garbage into an A/B test, you’ll get garbage out of it (albeit optimized garbage). . The A/B testing software is to CRO what a stopwatch is to a sprinter. The stopwatch doesn’t make the sprinter any faster. It just measures the sprinter’s performance, and tells them what is their personal best. . That’s where CRO expertise comes into play. Just as GI&nbsp;→&nbsp;GO, also AI&nbsp;→&nbsp;AO (A being Awesomeness). This book will give you loads of great insights, ideas, and awesomeness to put into your tests. . Let’s improve your website’s personal best. . So what is CRO? . Back in 2005, when we worked in-house, we tried hard to outsource conversion. It turned out to be impossible. There were many vendors, but each pushed its own solution: . The live chat companies claimed that live chat was the answer. . | The analytics companies claimed that analytics software was the answer. . | The usability companies claimed that usability was the answer. . | The multivariate testing vendors claimed that multivariate testing software was the answer. . | The copywriters claimed that copywriting was the answer. . | The eye-tracking companies claimed that eye-tracking was the answer. . | . And so on. . What we wanted was an independent advisor who was effectively a “hub” for conversion, who had used all of the services, who was completely impartial, and who knew how to get the best results. . We ended up doing it ourselves. As a result, we learned what worked. We now spend all of our time designing pages that convert&mdash;and then we put our necks on the line by insisting that we test our creations, to prove that we’ve measurably improved things. Over the past ten years, we have tried an enormous number of techniques, some of which were real gems. We have pulled together the best ones (along with practical, easy ways to get them done) and added many techniques that we developed ourselves. At each stage, we have shared our findings on our blog, which has rewarded us by attracting kindred spirits, people who share our passion. Hopefully, you’ll be one of them. . We coined the term conversion rate optimization (CRO) in 2007 to describe this process of pulling together all of the available tools, techniques, and skills&mdash;with the goal of improving a website’s conversion rates. CRO takes the guesswork out of creating highly profitable websites. It’s a series of strategies and activities that allow you to achieve significant increases in profits from your website easily and reliably. User testing and A/B testing software allow you to carry out tests; CRO tells you what to test, by revealing how to create webpages that convert your visitors. . Strictly speaking, CRO is web design done right. It’s making a page that is perfectly designed to sell, or get sign-ups, or get downloads, or whatever the page is there for. Even ten years later, though, the practice of CRO looks so different from how most web design is carried out that it still warrants having a separate name. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-68&quot;&gt; (Few people appreciate) why CRO is the most important activity for your business&mdash;and your career . Many companies still don’t appreciate the economic multipliers that make CRO so surprisingly profitable. In this chapter, you will discover the three benefits of CRO that can drive your company into an economic “virtuous circle” of growth. . Benefit 1: The obvious one&mdash;CRO gets you more customers, free . The obvious reason to improve your conversion rate is that you want more customers without having to spend a penny more on advertising. . Your revenue is equal to… . your number of visitors multiplied by… . | your conversion rate (the percentage of your visitors that turn into customers) multiplied by… . | the lifetime customer spend (the amount that each of them spends with you): . | . . Benefit 1: Doubling your conversion rate doubles your revenue. . So if you double your conversion rate, you double your revenue. (Whenever we say “double” in this chapter, it’s to make the examples easy to understand. But, as you’ll see, even a small increase can result in one heck of an office party. We highly recommend you carry out the calculations for your own business. They can be eye-opening.) . But CRO has other, even better benefits… . Benefit 2: Your profit is even more sensitive to your conversion rate than your revenue is . Your profit is your revenue minus all your costs: . Profit = Revenue − Costs . When you double your conversion rate, all your costs don’t double: . Your variable costs do double (by definition). This includes all costs that scale in proportion to the number of units sold, including the cost of goods sold, the costs of direct labor, distribution, and customer support. . | But your ad costs remain the same. . | And your fixed costs stay the same (by definition). . | . As a result, your profit increases disproportionately. Sometimes profoundly. The following diagram shows how a doubling of conversion rate can cause the profit to multiply by four times: . . Benefit 2: An increase in conversion rate has a disproportionate effect on profit. . The effect can be even greater. For some companies, a small increase in conversion rate can mean the difference between suffering a loss and making a profit. . Benefit 3 (an even more exciting one): CRO opens up floods of traffic . Once your conversion rate has increased, you&#39;re more profitable. It pays to sacrifice some of that profit into increasing your advertising bid prices&mdash;which can dramatically increase your number of customers. You can outbid your competitors and profitably dominate all the advertising space in your market. . Many of our clients find that CRO unlocks marketing opportunities that were previously prohibitively expensive, allowing them to get loads of new customers. . For startups and small-to-medium sized businesses, CRO is often the catalyst that enables them to start advertising, profitably, in PPC, magazines, newspapers, direct mail, radio, and TV. Clients also become able to pay affiliates more&mdash;which wins the affiliates over from their competitors. The principle even applies to SEO: if a company will generate twice as much revenue from the number-one spot, it can afford to spend twice as much to capture it. . This principle is so extreme that many advertising agencies pay us to work on their clients’ websites, because they understand that CRO allows their clients to profitably increase their ad spends. With the right combination of CRO and traffic buying, you can displace competitors for good. . Benefit 1 × Benefit 2 × Benefit 3 = The Power Law of CRO . Here’s the best bit: Benefits 1, 2 and 3 are multiplicative. Which means your profit has a power-law relationship to your conversion rate. (That is, your profit is equal to your conversion rate to the power of something&mdash;maybe squared, cubed, or even more.) . Looking at the equations from above, you can see why: . . The Power Law of CRO, which explains why so many of our clients have won awards for fast growth. . Of course, the multipliers depend on the financials of the business. You can see how your own profits would be affected by an increase in conversion rate by modeling different scenarios in a spreadsheet. . Incredibly, that’s not the end of it. As the number of orders grows, economies of scale kick in. These further increase the amount you can afford to spend on getting more customers. . CRO is a virtuous circle. The world’s leading web companies all focus on it&mdash;on user experience, conversion flows, network effects, and customer journeys. . Without doing CRO, it’s impossible to win. . Why CRO is a great career choice . In our experience, the best career strategy is to (1)&nbsp;Create more value. CRO allows you to reliably do this, and then (2)&nbsp;Prove you’ve done so. A/B testing allows you to do this. . As such, CRO makes for a fantastic career choice. There’s a serious shortage of people who have proof that they can grow businesses. Amazingly, most people’s résumés have no quantifiable evidence that they have ever created value. Thanks to CRO, many of our clients, followers, and team members have incredibly impressive success stories on their résumés. . Plus, if you’re anything like us, you’ll find it endlessly fascinating. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-28&quot;&gt; Reasons to start CRO now . The first-mover advantage . As long as you have a higher profit-per-visitor than your competitors do, then every day you’ll have a slight unfair economic advantage over them. . The wider you make that gap, the faster you accelerate ahead. That gap becomes a moat that makes your business robust against competitors’ attacks. . If your competitors aren’t focusing on CRO already, they will be soon, because the market will keep getting more competitive. . Every day you’re ahead, you have an unfair advantage&mdash;the wind is in your sails. Every day you are behind, you have an unfair disadvantage&mdash;you’re playing catch-up. . The difference depends on how soon you start, and how fast you move. . Does your business depend on free traffic? . If your web business depends on free traffic from search engines or social media sites, you’ll get the following additional benefits: . Because CRO enables you to profitably advertise in different media, your business will become much more stable. You’ll no longer be hooked on free traffic and no longer at the whim of a search engine algorithm change. . | CRO will make your website customer-centric, so your customers will like you more and stay with you for longer. It also means other websites are more likely to link to yours. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-32&quot;&gt; Why doubling a website’s conversion rate is easier than it sounds . What’s your current conversion rate? Five percent? Ten? Don’t know? A five percent conversion rate means that of every twenty visitors to your website, nineteen walk away empty-handed. Do you really believe you couldn’t lower that number to eighteen out of twenty? . Look at it another way: To double your conversion rate, you just need to increase the conversion rate of your… . ads by 19%; . | landing page by 19%; . | shopping cart by 19%; and . | checkout by 19%. . | . (The figure is 19%, not 25%, because each improvement compounds upon the previous one.) . These increases may sound daunting, but to increase your landing page’s conversion rate by 19%, for example, you would have to make just a 1.76% improvement to ten aspects of your landing page: . Your company’s tagline . | Your headline . | Your introductory text . | Your offer . | Your guarantee . | Your picture . | Your readability . | Your usability . | Your navigation . | Your products . | Your pricing . | Your offers . | Your premium . | Your testimonials . | Your call-to-action . | Your website layout . | Your return policy . | . And the list goes on. . Does a 19% increase sound more achievable now? . For the same reason, don’t be daunted by the number of techniques described in this book. If you did everything in it, you’d probably be the best marketer in the world. A single breakthrough can double your conversion rate. The most important thing is to take action. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-29&quot;&gt; Choose your role models wisely: Take inspiration from this awe-inspiring story of how one of our clients went from zero to half a billion dollars . We recently sorted through some old business cards from a conference we spoke at. We came across the following card, which had some interesting notes on it: . . Notes from our first conversation with Mike Lee of MyFitnessPal. . Our founder Karl had spoken at the conference. After the talk, he was approached by an entrepreneur called Mike Lee. Mike didn’t have a business card handy, so Karl wrote notes on one of his own cards. . Mike mentioned that he loved our articles. His company, MyFitnessPal, had created a smartphone app for counting calories. The company had just begun, but Mike was a fan of our articles and was already optimizing his business using multivariate testing. . Mike and his brother and cofounder, Albert, subsequently hired us to help MyFitnessPal grow even faster. . Mike and Albert recently sold MyFitnessPal for just under half a billion dollars. . Some people think that CRO is an activity to do “when we get round to it.” . Successful companies start immediately. . In fact, successful web companies do many things differently. Their behavior is startlingly different from the unsuccessful companies. In the following chapter, we describe three of the key differences&mdash;differences so profound that just by following them you’ll gain a huge advantage. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-70&quot;&gt; Why the world’s top websites are winning (and how yours can too) . As far as we are aware, no other company has had the privilege of designing pages for as many of the world’s top 500 websites as we have. We say privilege because these companies are, by definition, already great at creating websites, and many of them wouldn’t normally ask an external company to design pages for them. . When we look at how those companies improve their websites, it’s striking how their practices have almost nothing in common with the way that most other companies do it. Their approach is perhaps best described as “Scientific Web Design.” In this chapter, you will learn the three principles by which Scientific Web Design differs from most other web design, and we explain why it’s much more effective. . Principle 1: The top companies design for function, not aesthetics . Take a look at the following two hammers: . . The hammer on the left is popular with professionals. The one on the right belongs to Karl’s mother. . Both hammers have been meticulously designed, but for different goals. Karl’s mother’s hammer was designed for beauty. The Stanley hammer was designed for hammering. . They represent two approaches to design: . Aesthetic: Karl’s mother’s hammer represents good design to people who believe that design means “optimize for beauty.” It’s not good for hammering, so Karl’s mother uses her other hammer instead. . | Functional: The Stanley hammer represents good design to people who believe that design means “optimize for the product’s core function.” . | Similarly, there are two approaches to web design: . Aesthetic: Most web agencies design for beauty, paying little more than lip service toward the goals of the business and its customers. . | Functional: In our opinion, good web design means understanding your visitors&mdash;and your business&mdash;deeply, then designing to meet both of their needs. And by deeply, we mean not obeying an executive who says, “I know my customers,” but instead gaining deep insights through extensive research. . | Which approach is most effective? Take a look at the homepages of Google, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, LinkedIn, Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube, and other leading websites and decide for yourself. Are they designed for beauty, or does their form follow their function? . It amazes us how few people have noticed this. . To be clear, it’s fine to optimize for beauty if your insights indicate that your visitors will buy more as a result. At that point, functional design and aesthetic design become the same thing, and you should test making your website more beautiful. The mistake happens when companies think that pure aesthetics are a substitute for research and testing. . Scientific Web Design is functional. . Why not design for function and aesthetics? . Some people ask why they shouldn’t optimize for function and aesthetics. Even if their visitors are perfectly happy with the current appearance of the website, what’s the harm in being beautiful regardless? . It’s like asking “What’s the harm in giving an Olympic sprinter an egg and spoon to carry while he runs?” They don’t realize that beauty, like an egg and spoon, tends to slow progress to a crawl. . One of our first clients had one of the most beautiful, polished websites we had ever seen. We first noticed a problem when we asked the head developer to italicize a particular word. “That’s not just a fifteen-minute job,” he replied, “It will have to wait till next week.” We were amazed. We had just come from working in-house, where we had tripled our employer’s sales in twelve months. We were used to making changes quickly. Putting a word into italics would have taken us sixty seconds. We had taken that agility for granted. . Imagine if your website were as easy to edit as Wikipedia, Google Docs, or Justin Jackson’s article “This Is a Web Page” (which we urge you to read). How much more work would you get done? How quickly could you iterate? Typical web marketers could edit a Wikipedia page in one minute, but would take at least a day to make a similar change to their own website. That’s over a thousand times longer. Much of that time difference is because their own website is more complicated for aesthetic reasons: Fonts are substituted, decorative images are included, layouts are complicated, and ornamental graphics are added. The technical burden soon becomes immense: changes must be checked on multiple devices running multiple browsers on multiple operating systems; plug-ins conflict; fonts don’t render… . …and before long, you’re no longer outraged that it takes seven days&mdash;seven days!&mdash;to turn a word into italics. . Meanwhile, Facebook has pushed live several thousand more changes. . If your website is already more beautiful than Amazon’s, and your customers are happy with its appearance, are you sure that the best way to grow your business is to make it more beautiful&mdash;or have you just run out of ideas? Beauty can lead to sluggishness, and sluggishness can lead to economic death. . If you do make your website more beautiful, ensure your designs are minimalist&mdash;visually and technically. Keep them elegantly simple and easy to update. And don’t forget that&mdash;like the Stanley hammer&mdash;good functional design has a beauty of its own. . Principle 2: The top companies carry out experiments on their websites . When top companies change their websites, they measure the effects of the changes, using A/B testing software or some other type of experimental technique. We have already described the benefits of A/B testing. The following quotes may be useful if you’re trying to persuade your company to adopt a culture of testing: . “Being able to figure out quickly what works and what doesn’t can mean the difference between survival and extinction.” &mdash;Hal Varian, Google Chief Economist . “If you double the number of experiments you do per year you’re going to double your inventiveness.” &mdash;Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon . Here’s another great quote by Jeff Bezos: . “…successful invention, if you want to do a lot of that, you basically have to increase your rate of experimentation and that you can think of as a process&mdash;how do you go about organizing your systems, your people, all of your assets, your own daily life and how you spend time, how do you increase those things to increase your rate of experimentation?” . Principle 3: For reasons that are subtle, the top companies make frequent, incremental changes, and rarely (if ever) have huge website redesigns . Website redesigns are often painful. . . The vicious circle of website redesign. . Fortunately, there’s a better way. The top companies update their websites frequently&mdash;often weekly and sometimes daily. The changes are usually improvements to parts of pages rather than complete page redesigns or website redesigns. . “Every work day Facebook is safely updated with hundreds of changes including bug fixes, new features, and product improvements. Given hundreds of engineers, thousands of changes every week and hundreds of millions of users we have worldwide, this task seems like it should be impossible.” &mdash;Chuck Rossi, Facebook&#39;s Release Engineering Manager . If you update your website in incremental iterations, you get three benefits: . You get to see what’s working (and what’s not working) on a granular level. . | Your website-improvement process stays nimble because it’s always in use and is not mothballed until the next mega-redesign. . | You decrease the amount of work-in-progress (work that has been carried out, but is not yet at a stage where it can bear fruit). . | Work-in-progress is the toadstool of business; it looks harmless but is poisonous. For example, . Any work-in-progress is wasted money until it sees the light of day. . | Managing work-in-progress is work in itself, particularly with large projects. Large projects constipate companies. . | Problems aren’t seen until the eleventh hour. Some companies hire us after having had a sitewide redesign that actually decreased their conversion rate. In fact, at the time of writing, we are rescuing a website for which one of our clients had paid tens of millions of dollars. You might expect that a website that cost that much would perform extremely well. However, we are redesigning it page by page, and our pages are considerably outperforming the existing ones. . | The longer a project takes, the greater the expectation for a massive win once the redesign goes live. This results in the additional inertia of deliberation, double- and triple-checking, and design-by-committee, all of which erode speed (a dangerous practice in highly competitive markets). It’s no surprise then, that: . | Many projects are never completed. . | . That’s why Scientific Web Design entails carrying out frequent, iterative changes. . Why do some people willfully ignore these principles? . Some people choose not to follow the three principles of Scientific Web Design, for several reasons, including . Some people avoid accountability. . | People who work for agencies may not want their performance to be measured soon and frequently. There’s good money in quoting for huge white-elephant projects, delaying that moment of truth until all the money is in the bank. . | To uninitiated buyers, aesthetic design is easier to sell. Whether it’s hammers or websites, some people buy beauty. . | How to follow all three principles&mdash;and why it makes life hard in the short term but easier in the long term . The three principles of Scientific Web Design are embedded into our methodology as follows: . First, analyze your website and visitors. Through intensive research, identify the biggest opportunities for improvement. . | Next, implement the changes in frequent, small, targeted iterations. . | Then, put your neck on the line (like we do) by insisting that the changes be A/B tested to prove (or disprove) that they have grown the business. . | . This makes life challenging, because of course not every experiment results in a win; but there’s a strength in it too: you get immediate feedback, so you discover what works (and what doesn’t) for your specific marketplace. . That’s rare in business. . By taking this approach, your internal processes over time get reengineered for speed and profits&mdash;a hallmark of the top online businesses. . How can you benefit from Scientific Web Design? . By the fact that you are reading this, you are probably already persuaded of the principles of Scientific Web Design. If so, here’s what you can do: . If you are a marketer or designer, ensure that you follow the three success principles: Design pages that fulfill their primary purpose, measure and test everything you create, and minimize your work-in-progress. Learn how to make websites ultra-effective. . | If you are a manager, director, or company owner and you are struggling to persuade your team to show any interest in CRO, first set the “ground rules”: Insist that they always follow the three principles. (1)&nbsp;Design pages that fulfill their primary purpose. (2)&nbsp;Measure and test everything you create. (3)&nbsp;Minimize your work-in-progress. Pushing conversion knowledge upon someone is futile unless they are hungry for it. By setting the “rules of the game” (insisting that your team follows the three principles), you align their goals with those of your business, and your team will devour any information that will be useful to them. Then, when they measurably grow your business, your challenge becomes to pay them enough to keep them. Conversion skills are in short supply. . | Whoever you are, spread the word. We estimate that, worldwide, fewer than 1% of marketing decisions follow the principles of Scientific Web Design. Much of the web-design industry actively avoids them. So when you see people violating the principles described in this chapter, speak out. Write your own articles about this subject. Be the child who dares to tell the emperor that he’s wearing no clothes (and is carrying an egg and spoon). You don’t need to have a scientific background&mdash;you just need to have the diligence and discipline to follow the principles. And when you encounter people who dare to follow the principles of Scientific Web Design, encourage and support them. They haven’t chosen the easy path. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-18&quot;&gt; Why you should avoid meek tweaking (and not just because it sounds creepy) . Just because your changes are going to be incremental and frequent doesn’t mean they should be minor or trivial. In fact, the biggest mistake people make when optimizing their websites is what we call “meek tweaking.” They set up A/B testing software, then they make daft changes. They change button colors and shuffle items around the page, just because they read that it worked for someone else. They do the Garbage In → Garbage Out thing. . The following graph explains why that approach is more harmful than it sounds. . . In A/B tests, small improvements take much longer to detect. . The horizontal axis shows the improvement you are looking to detect. The vertical axis shows the time it will take to detect that improvement. . The curved line shows how long it will take for an A/B test to reach completion. It’s for a page that gets 300 views/day (that’s about 9,000 views/month). The shape of the curve would be similar (just higher or lower) for other traffic volumes. . Imagine that you have just designed a new version of such a page, and your new version has an 80% higher conversion rate than the existing version. As you can see in the graph, the time taken to detect that improvement would be just two days. . Whereas if your new version was only 20% better than the existing page, the A/B test would take twenty-three days to reach completion. . In other words, to detect an improvement that’s a quarter as large (20% compared with 80%), then your A/B test would take over ten times as long (twenty-three days compared with two days). . If you were looking to detect an improvement of only 10%, then the A/B test would take several months to conclude. . The moral of the story is that small improvements take ages to detect, disproportionately and counterintuitively so. . So you should aim for bold, targeted changes, for the following reasons: . Each change gets you more profit (an 80% improvement gives four times the benefit of a 20% improvement, obviously). . | It’s more fun and interesting. . | It’s much quicker. . | Whereas if you’re doing what we call meek tweaking&mdash;making small, arbitrary changes, then your project suffers: . You tend to get no wins. Your A/B tests never reach a conclusion. . | This becomes disheartening, and you lose motivation. . | You lose the buy-in from all the other people in your company whom you persuaded that A/B testing was going to be a good idea. . | &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-31&quot;&gt; DiPS (Diagnose → Problem → Solution) thrashes meek tweaking . Most marketers do things to their websites that they’d never do to their bodies. . The most common causes of death in people are heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory infection, diabetes, and dementia. However, on seeing that list, only a fool would rush to a pharmacy and start taking medication against all of those ailments, wolfing down pills for diseases they don’t have. Such behavior would cause more harm than good. Instead, sensibly, when someone is ill, they go to a physician who first diagnoses what’s wrong and only then prescribes the most relevant remedy. . That may sound obvious for health, but it’s not what people do with their websites. Most web marketers run straight to the “marketing pharmacy” and cram their webpages with every possible remedy. Then they wonder why they have a website that’s cluttered and converts no better&mdash;or even worse&mdash;than the previous version. It’s marketing malpractice. Their visitors had specific objections, but instead of overcoming those objections, the marketers filled their pages with irrelevant distractions. They should be struck off. . Your visitors’ attention is limited. You must treat it preciously. . DiPS: A formula for success . The following approach to conversion is much more effective than the one described above. We call it Diagnose&ndash;Problem&ndash;Solution (DiPS for short). DiPS is the web-marketing equivalent of the physician doing tests to diagnose what is wrong, then analyzing the test data to identify the problem, and then coming up with an appropriate solution. . To implement DiPS, you first need to carry out research to diagnose your website’s problems. You’ll need to understand a lot about your visitors and how they interact with your website. . Conversion solutions are highly targeted; the problems are like locks&mdash;the solutions like keys . Here’s an example to illustrate why DiPS is so effective. And why the alternative&mdash;blindly applying best practices&mdash;is so ineffective. . Imagine that a company, ABC Corps, had just launched a new product, the ABCmatic. . Would you buy one? Probably not, for one of the following reasons: . You don’t know what it does. . | You know what it does, but you don’t know why you’d need one. . | You aren’t convinced that it will do what it claims to do. . | You don’t know whether it’s compatible with your existing technology. . | You think it’s too expensive. . | You don’t trust the company. You’ve never heard of them before. . | You are going to think about it. . | If you don’t know what the ABCmatic does, ABC Corps would have to explain what it does. Would a guarantee help instead? No. Would a lower price help instead? Not at all. Would testimonials help? No. None of those things would help one iota. The only thing that could advance your decision is an explanation of what the ABCmatic does&mdash;such as “ABCmatic allows you to manage your computer’s memory.” In fact, all those other solutions would merely reduce the chance that you’d ever find the paragraph that explains what the product does. The problem is like a lock, and the solution is like a key. . Now, imagine that you understand what the ABCmatic does, but can’t understand why that would benefit you. Would a guarantee help? No! Would a lower price help? No! Would a price discount help? No! The only thing that would advance your decision is an explanation of how the features relate to benefits that you care about&mdash;such as an explanation that “The ABCmatic helps to clear your computer’s memory cache, so your computer runs up to twice as fast.” That would do the job. Nothing else would. . And so, for each objection, you need to display a clear counterobjection. . If visitors don’t know what it does, then explain what it does. . | If visitors know what it does, but they don’t know why they’d need one, then explain the benefits. . | If visitors aren’t convinced that it will do what it claims to do, then add proof. . | If visitors don’t know whether it’s compatible with your existing technology, then explain the compatibility details. . | If visitors think it’s too expensive, then justify the price. . | If visitors don’t trust the company, then show evidence that the company is trustworthy. . | If visitors are going to think about it, then provide reasons to act promptly. . | . It’s the same with every single page element on a website. Every image, every word has a very specific purpose&mdash;usually to create a thought in the visitors’ minds that will move them closer to taking action. Guarantees, for example, are mechanisms that have two very specific functions: to reduce risk and to demonstrate that the company is confident in its claims. So guarantees work only when risk and proof are issues. In other situations, they make no difference. Negative headlines are another example of a mechanism. Negative headlines (such as “7 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a CRM”) work when the visitors have decided that they’ll do something (in this case, choose a CRM) and their main thought is “How can I avoid making the wrong decision?” In such cases, negative headlines work great; otherwise, they don’t. . Most marketers know some conversion mechanisms, but few understand each mechanism’s function. So they litter pages with “best practices”&mdash;a practice that’s far from best. . The best marketers create funnels that counter each objection at the exact moment that the visitors think about it. And the only way to do that is to understand the visitors well. . The best marketers find out&mdash;not guess&mdash;exactly why their visitors aren’t currently converting. . If only there were some great techniques for finding out… . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-33&quot;&gt; Section 2: Diagnosis.

In 2008, we published the most comprehensive article about how to understand your website’s visitors. Back then, there were hardly any tools for doing it: our list contained just fourteen. As evidence of how much the web has changed since then, this section contains 200 resources&mdash;software, techniques and UX tools for finding out exactly why your potential customers aren’t converting. . It’s pure gold. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-71&quot;&gt; Why it pays to understand your visitors . It’s hard to delight people if you don’t know them. . Winning web businesses understand their customers better than their competitors do. . Fortune magazine described our approach as “a combination of multivariate statistical analysis and good old-fashioned detective work.” This section is about the detective work. . So what do you need to know about your visitors? You need to know… . what makes them tick; . | what stops them from ticking more often; . | how you can increase their dollars-per-tick (we might be straining the “tick” analogy here). . | . At the very least, you need to understand why most of them leave without buying. . Unfortunately, those nonconverting visitors come and go without a trace. How can you find out what they wanted? How do you know what would have persuaded them to take action? . If you owned a real-life bricks-and-mortar store, this would be easy: You’d hear their objections. You’d be able to ask questions. You’d hear what they muttered as they headed for the door. . Capturing the voice of the customer is more difficult on the web, but it can be done. It’s what our Research Department does every day. Over the past ten years, we have carried out research for hundreds of companies. We have used every type of tool. (We often use whichever tools our clients are already using, so we are forced to know them all.) . We are also constantly testing out new ways of using the tools. What’s the best question to ask visitors when they exit a page? And how do you word that question to get the highest response rate? . We know it, we’ve tested it, and in this section we share all the details. We will describe the tools and techniques that we have found to be the most useful&mdash;those that generate the most “insights per minute.” Each technique provides insight into a different aspect of your visitors’ behavior&mdash;including what the visitors want, what they like, how they make decisions, and what they don’t like. Together, they create a clear picture of how you can improve your website’s performance and profits. . How we’ve categorized the following techniques . It used to be that each software solution carried out a specific function. Now, they all tend to be turning into all-purpose suites, making them hard to categorize. We have grouped each software solution into the functionality for which we most often use it. . Some of the techniques require a lot of visitors. So before we dive in, let’s take a quick tour of which of them you should focus on if you have a low-traffic website. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-15&quot;&gt; Techniques for low-traffic websites . Why conversion is hard for low-traffic websites . If you are a startup or a small company, you are in a chicken-and-egg situation: . To afford visitors, you need a good conversion rate. . | But it’s hard to improve your conversion rate if you have no visitors. . | . Low-traffic websites have two problems: . Problem 1: How can you understand your visitors? For example, how can you find out what’s stopping them from taking action? It’s not easy when there aren’t many of them to ask. Tumbleweed can’t tell you how it feels. . Problem 2: How can you measure what works? High-traffic websites rely on A/B tests to measure whether their changes make a statistically significant difference. But A/B tests often don’t reach significance when there isn’t enough traffic. . If you’re feeling overwhelmed, take heart in the knowledge that every successful company has had to pass through this stage at one point. . We’ll tackle the first of those problems now. We’ll address Problem 2 later, in the chapter on A/B testing. . The solution to Problem 1: The techniques you should use to understand your visitors if your website doesn’t get much traffic . Some of the techniques we mention in this section rely upon a website getting lots of traffic. Some surveys, for example, typically get a completion rate of 3%. If your business is small, we recommend that you make the most of the following techniques, which can be carried out even if your website gets just a few visitors per day. Each of them is described in detail in the following chapters: . User tests tend to be the most fruitful technique. Ask a friend&mdash;or anyone you can get your hands on&mdash;to participate. Once your website is refined enough, aim to user test it on people who are from your target demographic and psychographic. . | Watch session recordings of the visitors you have. Doing so will give you insight into how web visitors see your website. Plus, you’ll see your creation through fresh eyes. . | Speak to salespeople (what we call “VOC Aggregators”)&mdash;people who have sold face-to-face the same type of product&mdash;or similar products. . | Analyze competitors’ websites. Or, if you don’t have any obvious competitors, look at companies that are successful within adjacent fields. For example, if you sell B2B software, look at other B2B software vendors. . | Add your phone number prominently to the top of every page. Even if you have no plans to encourage phone calls on an ongoing basis, it can help to get at least a few of them. In fact, you may be able to charm your early callers into becoming long-term user testers. . | Increase the incentives for visitors to complete surveys. The more you offer as an incentive, the higher percentage of responses you are likely to get. . | . It’s easier to learn CRO by working on high-traffic websites . Low-traffic websites aren’t the best places to learn the craft of CRO; it’s easier to learn by working on websites that get lots of traffic. . So, if you want to become world-class at CRO, you would benefit from finding an opportunity to work on a high-traffic website. If the low-traffic website in question is yours, and you can’t afford to take a sabbatical working on a high-traffic website, then you may want to hire someone who has. . With high-traffic websites, you get exposed to fire hoses of feedback. Feedback fire hoses are valuable for two reasons. In the short term, they allow you to iterate and improve what you’re working on. But they also hone your craft. The top performers in many fields of endeavor are those who have, at some point in their careers, been exposed to fire hoses of feedback. Most successful movie comedians, for example, developed their comedy intuition by performing night after night in front of live audiences, getting instant feedback on every word, movement, and gesture they made. Most successful bands began their careers playing in front of live audiences, learning&mdash;on a second-by-second basis&mdash;what audiences liked and disliked. So if you want to become great at conversion, seek opportunities to work on high-traffic websites. Ideally, you want to work in a company that’s big enough to have loads of traffic and agile enough to allow you to move fast. In doing so, you’ll quickly develop a knack of knowing what will convert&mdash;and what won’t. . Then, when you’ve learned the craft, you’ll find it much easier to grow a low-traffic website. . Right, on to the techniques… . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-69&quot;&gt; Installing a tag manager (to help you activate and deactivate tags without having to speak with your IT department each time) . This section will no doubt persuade you to install multiple tools on your website. You may get tired of asking your developers to activate, manage, and deactivate tags. So before we continue, you may benefit from installing a tag-management solution. Tag-management solutions provide marketers with an easy-to-use interface that doesn’t require the user to have IT skills or IT permissions. . Tools for tag management . Google Tag Manager is very popular. Alternatives include Adobe Activation Core Service, Conversant Tag Manager, Ensighten, IBM Digital Data Exchange, Qubit Opentag, Tag Manager by Impact Radius, TagCommander, and Tealium iQ. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-55&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using web analytics (to track where your visitors came from, and which links they clicked on) . Web analytics software gives you details about the visitors to your website&mdash;where they came from, and which links they clicked on once they arrived. It’s essential for CRO, but it tells only a small part of the story. It’s like the closed-circuit TV cameras in a supermarket. They give an aerial view of where visitors entered the store, but they don’t reveal why the visitors came. They show the path that visitors took through the store, but they don’t reveal what the visitors were thinking. They show you exactly where and when the visitors left the store, but not why. Or what to do about it. For that, you’ll need qualitative tools, which are described later. . You’ll find web analytics most useful in the early stages of a project, when you are seeking to identify on which pages to start work. It will also inform the pages on which you should implement the tools described in the rest of the chapters in this section. If a page gets no visitors, then changing it will have no effect. Nor will changing a page that already has a 100% conversion rate. Web analytics software will help you to identify the arteries of the website&mdash;the high-traffic flows that lead to successful conversions. Along with other tools, it can also help you to spot the aspects of those flows that are currently underperforming. . Tools for web analytics . Despite being free, Google Analytics is a sophisticated and powerful web analytics suite. It is sufficient for most websites, and most of our clients use it or its enterprise equivalent, Google Analytics 360. . Google Analytics alternatives include Adobe Analytics, Webtrends, Quantcast Measure, Woopra, Matomo, and Flurry Analytics. . Kissmetrics and Mixpanel provide additional functionality that can be useful to conversion marketers. Cohort reports, for example, show how groups of visitors behave over a long period. Amplitude helps marketers to understand how users behave within a website or app. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-57&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…capturing easy-to-interpret click maps (to see exactly where visitors clicked&mdash;even if it wasn’t on a link) . Whereas web analytics software tells you what links your visitors click on, click-mapping software shows you which parts of your pages your visitors click on. There’s a subtle difference: click-mapping software shows you clicks even if they weren’t on a link. This information is displayed as a “heat map,” like this: . . Crazy Egg’s confetti map shows exactly where visitors clicked&mdash;even if it wasn’t on a link. . Click-mapping offers several advantages: . It will reveal things that are getting clicked but are not clickable. You’ll discover that visitors are clicking on parts of the page that aren’t links but perhaps should be. For example, if you discover visitors are clicking on a product photo, you may choose to allow the picture to be magnified, or you may decide readers want to read more information about it. Similarly, they may wrongly believe that a particular graphic is navigation. . | It will also reveal, at a glance, which parts of the page are getting the most attention. This can be particularly useful when you’re showing the data to people who aren’t experienced in web analytics. . | If several of the links on your page lead to the same URL&mdash;for example, if there are three links to a particular product page&mdash;click-mapping will show you which of the links your visitors clicked on. This is technically possible with analytics, but requires some set-up. . | Have you ever wondered how far visitors scroll down your pages? Many click-mapping tools can give you the answer, in the form of easy-to-interpret scroll maps. If some of your pages are long, scroll maps can reveal which parts of the page get the most attention (based on the average viewing time). This can be great for identifying which parts of your page are most important to your visitors. If one of your pages has a “false bottom”&mdash;a gap in the design that appears to visitors to be the bottom of the page&mdash;then a scroll map will reveal that visitors aren’t scrolling. (You then need to work out whether that’s because they didn’t realize that the page could be scrolled, or because they weren’t interested enough to scroll.) . | We recommend you study click-mapping reports of your most important pages (in terms of revenue and traffic) and of any pages you feel may have usability issues. . Of course, most heat maps show many things that are predictable, but that’s not why you should use heat maps. Ignore the predictable heat and look for the anomalies. . Tools for click-mapping . We often use Crazy Egg, Hotjar, and Clicktale, and several A/B testing tools that include similar functionality. Alternatives include Fullstory, Inspectlet, Decibel Insight, Jaco, Lucky Orange, MouseStats, Ptengine, and userTrack. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-73&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using session-recording tools (to see videos of visitors’ screens and more) . . Hotjar’s session recordings allow you to see how your visitors struggled their way through your website. . Web analytics software is concerned mostly with the movement of visitors between pages. Session-recording tools can be a great complement, revealing what visitors did on each page, by capturing each visitor’s keystrokes and mouse movement. . Session-recording tools can be useful in the following ways: . Replay sessions: Watch movies of your visitors’ screens as they use your website. You can view visitors’ browsing sessions as videos, as if you were looking over their shoulders. You can choose which video to watch based on attributes such as the visitor’s country of origin, how much time they spend on the website, or the number of pages they visited. You may choose to watch videos of visitors who appear to be struggling&mdash;for example, those who visit the same page several times. . | Get a feel for how people use websites: Session-recording tools are not a substitute for carrying out user tests, which are described later. However, watching a few videos will give you a better idea of how people interact with websites. . | See errors: The software can display a report of errors that users have encountered. . | Analyze funnels: Get to see where your visitors are dropping off. Clicktale, in particular, makes it easy to study funnels for opportunities. . | See scroll maps: Scroll maps reveal how far down your page visitors scrolled. . | Tools for recording sessions . Clicktale pioneered session-recording software. Alternatives include Hotjar, Inspectlet, UserReplay, SessionCam, FullStory, Decibel Insight, and Mouseflow. (Each tool tends to have multiple functions, so our choice of tool often depends on the combination of features and functions that a particular client requires. Also, some of our clients already have a tool installed when we begin the project.) . Some companies&mdash;such as those in financial services&mdash;are regulated as to how their data must be stored. Clicktale offers an enterprise version for such cases. IBM Tealeaf is another popular alternative for enterprises. Decibel Insight offers on-premises deployment, so you can store data in your own environment and have complete control. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-62&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using form-analytics software (to identify which of your form fields are causing trouble) . Form-analytics software allows you to study how people are interacting with your forms. The software is extremely important, because visitors who interact with forms are very likely to convert. By finding out why they bail, you can unlock great profits. . The software can report on many issues, including the following: . The overall success of the form: how many visitors landed on it, and what percentage of them interacted with it, tried to submit it, and successfully submitted it. . | The percentage of visitors who dropped out at each form field. Knowing this information allows you to fix&mdash;or remove&mdash;the form fields that are causing visitors to lose their patience and abandon your website. . | The amount of time that visitors spend on each field. Even if the visitors don’t abandon at a particular field&mdash;maybe it’s early in the form and they are still motivated&mdash;it may fatigue them, causing them to abandon later. . | Which fields tend to get left blank. A blank response often indicates that a field is confusing or intimidating. Such fields reduce a visitor’s resolve to complete the form. . | Which fields result in error messages, which the visitors then need to edit before they can resubmit the form. . | Which browsers and devices are performing poorly. Maybe your form is hard to use on small mobile devices. . | . Tools for form analytics . Options for form analytics include Clicktale, Hotjar, Formisimo, Decibel Insight, SessionCam, and Inspectlet. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-72&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using live chat (to let your visitors tell you what’s wrong with your pages) . . Live chat software helps in several ways: you can convert visitors via the chat conversations, you can discover their objections, and you can test your counter-objections. . Live chat can allow you to hear from visitors who wouldn’t phone you. Such visitors might prefer live chat for some of the following reasons: . They are in a public place (or at work) and don’t want to be heard. . | They appreciate that, unlike phone calls, live chat doesn’t cost money. . | They don’t want to be stuck at the end of a phone waiting for someone to answer. . | They feel that a live chat session is less of a commitment than a phone call. . | . Live chat can reveal the following: . which pages are giving people problems; . | which products people are asking questions about; . | what questions, concerns, and objections your visitors have; . | which of your answers, reassurances, and counterobjections persuade visitors to take further action. . | Live chat can have three additional benefits: . If your customer service team is providing your live chat, you may choose to read through the transcripts of the chats regularly to find insights you can apply to your website. . | If the customer service team uses canned responses, then you should study them. They can be pure, field-tested copywriting gold&mdash;provided they have been refined over time to be the best responses. . | Using live chat may increase your conversion rate, by personally helping the visitors to take action. . | Tools for live chat . Popular tools for live chat include Zendesk Chat, LiveChat, Drift, Freshdesk, Olark, LivePerson, HappyFox, SnapEngage, LiveAgent, Chatra, Intercom, tawk.to, Tidio, and Comm100. Some of them, like Intercom, allow you to track, help, and convert visitors across multiple browsing sessions. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-63&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using cobrowsing (so your visitors can share their screens with you) . Cobrowsing software allows your visitors to share their screens with a customer-support person. Cobrowsing tends to be particularly useful when you struggle to work out what your visitors are seeing&mdash;for example, if the visitor is looking at a dynamically generated page, like a page of search results or an interface in a web app. . Tools for cobrowsing . Tools for cobrowsing include Pega, Oracle Service Cloud, and Surfly. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-25&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using survey tools (to ask your visitors and customers whatever you want to know) . To help us grow our clients’ businesses, we carry out extensive research. Over ten million people have seen our surveys. . Surveys are powerful, because your customers know the answers to a surprising number of your marketing questions. . So why not ask them? . Awesome, tested questions to ask your customers . The following questions can provide invaluable insights. We recommend you identify the ones that will populate the gaps in your existing knowledge. . “How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?” This is known as the “Net Promoter Question.” Answers should be on a scale of 0 (not 1) to 10. The question can be deceptively useful. In the chapter on lifetime customer value (LCV), you’ll see the theory behind it, and details of how to analyze the data from it. . | “In the past six months, have you criticized or spoken highly of [YourCompanyName] to a friend, colleague, or family member? If so, please give details.” This is a great way to jog the customer’s memory and elicit specific criticism or specific praise. In the latter case, you might get a response that could be used as a testimonial. (If you want to use it that way, be sure to get permission first.) . | “If you could have us create something just for you, what would it be?” Your customers can be a good source of ideas for new products, and this question is a great way of collecting those ideas. More straightforward&mdash;but less thought-provoking&mdash;wording would be “What other products or services should we offer?” . | If you don’t know how you differ from your competitors, there’s a good chance your customers can tell you. The question “How would you describe us to a friend?” reveals why your customers like you. Similarly, you could ask a question along the lines of the following: “Which other options did you consider before choosing our product or service?” or “Why did you decide to use us?” It’s particularly important to ask questions from this group before you undertake any re-branding exercise, so you understand what your existing positioning is. . | “Do you use us for all your [ProductType] or do you also use alternative companies? If so, why?” . | “Why do you use [YourCompanyName or YourProductName] rather than the alternatives?” . | If you want your customers to use you more often, you could do worse than to ask them “What would persuade you to use us more often?” Can you see how survey questions can save you a lot of trial and error? . | “How could we persuade your friends or colleagues to use us?” “If you were in charge of our company, how would you persuade people like yourself to use us?” and “If you were in charge of our company, how would you spread the word about us?” . | . Not every answer will be valuable, but just one gem can lead to a boost in profits. . The answer to this one question could skyrocket your sales . We have devised one question that’s incredibly useful. In fact, it almost always reveals an easy way to increase a company’s sales. It works like magic on any business&mdash;online or offline. . We arrived at it after seeing a TV program about a military assault course&mdash;a series of rope swings, climbing nets, and muddy pools. The TV presenter was interviewing people who had just finished the course, asking them what had been the worst obstacle. Several of the finishers mentioned a tall wall that had been tough to climb. The scene then cut to a view of that wall, revealing that, sure enough, many people were still stuck behind the wall. After several attempts at climbing it, they were giving up and dropping out. . We wondered how we could adapt that question to sales processes, to identify the conceptual “walls” that prevent prospects from buying. . We devised the question, asked it of our clients’ customers, and discovered that it has an incredible ability to identify obstacles&mdash;and hence opportunities for growth. The question is so valuable, it deserves its own page (but it’s not getting one). The question is…rabba dabba dabba (this is supposed to be a drum roll) dabba dabba dabba…TISH!: “What nearly stopped you buying from us?” . The wording can be modified depending on what your company does. It could also end with “from using us” or “from signing up.” . You can also ask the question in many ways. For example, you can use a survey on your website’s thank-you page or even email the customer a link to the survey. In other cases, it’s worth asking the question when speaking to customers&mdash;either face-to-face or on the phone. . There are some important subtleties and realizations as to why the question works so well. . Reason 1: You put it to your customers, not to those who didn’t buy from you . This might sound counterintuitive. Surely, you might think, if Alice buys one of your sports cars and Bob doesn’t, it’s Bob’s opinions that you need to hear. But the problem with nonbuyers like Bob is that they are a mixed bunch. Some of them will be qualified to buy from you and many of them won’t. For example, some Bobs just want to test drive a sports car and have no intention of buying. If you ask Bobs why they didn’t buy, their responses can be red herrings; often they complain about price. The Alices, on the other hand, are (by definition) qualified prospects. And you’d like more of them. . Reason 2: Your customers have been through the entire sales funnel and your noncustomers haven’t . Your customers know what they are talking about. They’ve paid enough attention to make a decision, so they know enough to be able to make good suggestions. A noncustomer, on the other hand, may have bailed after only a few seconds. His or her opinion&mdash;however strong&mdash;is much less likely to be accurate. When your buyers criticize you, they are likely to be right. . Reason 3: Even though your customers overcame every barrier to buying from you, they weren’t oblivious to the barriers . When you ask Alice, “What nearly stopped you buying from us?” she will still remember the biggest barriers. And for every Alice who successfully overcame the barriers, you’ll almost certainly find there were several people who gave up. When you remove the barrier, sales increase. . There are clear benefits to asking this question. And it works on any process that you’d like more people to complete. . So…what’s nearly stopping you from asking it? . Other things you need to know about your customers . You need to know which of your products your customers like most, and why. . The products that are most liked aren’t necessarily the ones that you sell most of. Just because a restaurant might sell a lot of lasagna doesn’t mean their lasagna is well liked. In fact, it might be deterring customers from ever coming back. . Discovering how well-liked each of your products is allows you to do two things: . Design the most effective sales funnel, so your most-liked products aren’t hidden away; and . | Improve your existing products, to make purchasers more likely to buy from you again. . | Your survey can constantly be changing, which will allow you to keep getting deeper insights into your visitors and customers. A survey may reveal insights that you decide to explore further in subsequent surveys. . Asking questions to your noncustomers . So far, we have only discussed customers but your noncustomers are a valuable source of information, too. After all, they are the ones you are trying to convert. You can ask noncustomers many of the questions above, via exit surveys, survey panels, and many other techniques, all of which we’ll describe in the following chapters. . What to do if you have no one to survey . If you have no one to survey&mdash;perhaps because you’re working on a startup or a product for a new market&mdash;then Google Consumer Surveys can be useful. You choose your target audience from Google’s panel of users, type your questions, and then receive responses within hours. It works best for products and services that have broad appeal. Similar, but more flexible, is Pollfish. . Learn more about questions . For more about the subject of asking questions, visit our website and watch the talk “‘Golden questions’ that reveal exactly why your visitors aren’t converting (slides and video).” . Tools for surveying . We often use whichever survey tools our clients use. Popular options include SurveyMonkey, Google Forms (which has few features, but is agile), Survey Gizmo, Medallia Digital, Survey Anyplace (specifically for mobile), Wufoo, Clicktools, Polldaddy, Typeform, and Uservoice. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-67&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using exit survey tools (to ask your visitors why they didn’t take action) . . Visitors don’t know why they abandoned until after they have abandoned. Exit surveys allow you to gather insights that couldn’t have been gathered any sooner. . One of the best times to capture your visitors’ objections is as soon as they have them: at the moment that they leave your website. The following questions can come in useful in exit surveys: . Question 1: What was the purpose of your visit? . | Question 2: Were you able to complete the purpose of your visit today? . | If they answer no to Question 2, ask Question 3: What stopped you completing the purpose of your visit today? . | . If your website has multiple distinct segments of visitors, you may choose to add a question that reveals the visitor’s segment too. . Tools for exit surveys . iPerceptions provides a ready-made way of implementing exit surveys. You can also create them using Usabilla, Informizely, Qualaroo, Hotjar, Medallia Digital, and ForeSee. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-35&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using on-page survey tools (to ask questions at exactly the right moment) . . Exit surveys allow your visitors to tell you why they abandoned your website. . Some information can best be obtained by surveying your visitors while they are on a specific page. In doing so, you can ask questions at the exact moment that the visitors are thinking the thoughts you want to hear. On-page survey tools let you add surveys to the corner of a page or, more prominently, to its middle, obscuring the other content. . Several options are available: . You can decide what type of response you want. You can have radio buttons, multiple-answer checkboxes, or open text fields. . | You can decide who will participate in the survey. For example, you could arrange to show the survey only to returning visitors who have been viewing the page for fifty seconds. . | You can ask several questions in one survey. . | You can receive email notifications of responses. Sometimes respondents ask questions to which they expect answers. . | . Tools for on-page surveys . We often use Qualaroo, Informizely, and Hotjar. Alternatives include Medallia Digital, Feedback Lite, PopSurvey and WebEngage. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-146&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using a persistent “Give Feedback” button (to allow your visitors to report issues to you) . . “Give Feedback” buttons allow your visitors to leave feedback at a time of their choosing. . Have you ever been frustrated by a website, but couldn’t find any way to communicate your frustrations to its creators? . Your own visitors never need to feel that way. Simply add a “Give Feedback” button to every page of your website. Such buttons tend to be placed statically on the side of the page, like a little Levis tab (albeit one that slides down your jeans when you stand up). . We have such a button on our website. It’s a green “Feedback” button on the right-hand side of each page. . Though “Give Feedback” buttons are simple, they can be highly effective, acting as persistent open invitations for feedback. . Tools for “Give Feedback” buttons . You can easily add a “Give Feedback” button using one of the following solutions: Survicate, Feedback Lite, Feedbackify, Usabilla, Qualtrics, Medallia Digital, and SurveyGizmo (the “Give Feedback” button is one of its many features). For Conversion Rate Experts’ website, for reasons of leanness, we don’t use a hosted software solution; we simply link our “Feedback” button to the form on our “Contact Us” page. . The software hosts the feedback forms, and then allows the website’s creators to view&mdash;and manage&mdash;the responses. (In several of the apps, the feedback is managed using an interface similar to that of an email client, having an inbox and folders.) If visitors leave their email addresses, the website’s customer-support team can easily reply to the feedback. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-37&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using your website’s search tool (to discover what your visitors can’t otherwise find) . Your website’s “Search This Site” feature is useful in two ways. Not only does it help your visitors find what they are looking for, but the resulting site search report in your analytics package also provides you with a wealth of information about how to improve your website. It tells you what your visitors want but can’t find. . Look through the search logs for a particular page: . Are visitors searching for content that doesn’t exist? If so, consider adding it to your website. . | Are they searching for content that does exist? If so, check whether the search would have revealed the most relevant page. Also, consider whether the content they were looking for should be added to&mdash;or made more prominent on&mdash;the page from which they launched their search. . | What specific words do the visitors use in their searches? Consider aligning your language with theirs. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-0&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using search engines (to be notified when people say things about you) . . Search engines allow you to track what the world is saying about your company and products. Moz Fresh Web Explorer is great for this. . Several search engines track mentions in real time, allowing you to discover what people are saying about your website on blogs, forums, and in social media. . As you read through the results, make a list of what people are saying. What do they like about your website? What don’t they like about it? . Then consider how you can fix any problems. . When we redesigned our own website, we used this technique to make a list of people who had commented on our old website. We then personally asked those people for feedback about our new design. . Tools for tracking what people are saying about you . The following tools can be useful for tracking mentions: Moz Fresh Web Explorer, Google Alerts, Talkwalker Alerts, Mention, Ninja Outreach, Twitter Search, BuzzSumo, and Facebook. . Salesforce Marketing Cloud provides powerful tools for real-time analysis and monitoring of social media. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-16&quot;&gt; Interlude (ice creams not included): why it’s essential to empathize with your visitors . The Roman poet Horace once said, “If you wish me to weep, you yourself must first feel grief.” In other words, you can’t arouse a feeling in someone until you have experienced that feeling yourself. . In his book Making Ads Pay, the veteran copywriter John Caples illustrated this by describing a demonstration that his physics professor once carried out (you can see it on YouTube). The professor fastened two tuning forks close to each other, then struck one of them hard with a hammer. Its sound rang out like a chime. Then he seized the vibrating fork with his hand, and the music stopped. To the class’s surprise, the other tuning fork had started to vibrate and was giving off the same musical note. . Caples observed that emotional vibrations work in the same way; they travel from one person to another. When you write, the tuning fork within you must vibrate at the same frequency as the tuning forks within your visitors. . So before you can write compelling copy, you must emotionally empathize with your visitors. . It isn’t easy, though. As a web marketer, your work is almost intrinsically ivory-tower work. It’s hard to even meet your visitors, never mind empathize with them. So how do you develop this emotional resonance? . Quantitative feedback tools&mdash;like clickstream analytics&mdash;don’t help, because they just give you numbers. Qualitative feedback tools&mdash;like surveys&mdash;can give you the voice of the visitor, but they aren’t sufficient to turn you into a tuning fork. Several of the following techniques (method marketing plus to a lesser extent face-to-face selling, encouraging visitors to phone you, and talking to “VOC aggregators”)&mdash;are what we call ultra-qualitative. They are at the core of how we approach conversion. You don’t hear much about them because no one has found a way to package them into neat little subscription services. You’ll never see ads for them. That doesn’t make them any less valuable. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-21&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using method marketing (become a customer so that you understand at least one customer deeply) . Method marketing is a term that was coined by the marketer Denny Hatch. It’s inspired by the “method” approach to acting. It’s said that when Robert De Niro came to New York for the filming of the movie Taxi Driver, he arrived early and proceeded to get a job as a real taxi driver. For two weeks, he worked long shifts. By the time filming began, De Niro was no longer a Hollywood celebrity trying to imagine how it must feel to be a taxi driver. He actually was a taxi driver. He had experienced the dangers. He had suffered the fatigue. And he felt at home in his car. He had gained the tacit knowledge of a real taxi driver. . Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to learn from the words of others. Perhaps the best way to appreciate its power is to read the following list: . Tacit knowledge: things that you can’t understand unless you have experienced them . Many things can’t be understood unless you’ve experienced them yourself. People who have had certain experiences find them difficult to articulate to people who haven’t: . being a parent; . | having a migraine; . | orgasm; . | being drunk; . | flying; . | being blind; . | having a loved one die; . | spiritual enlightenment; . | meditation; . | hallucinogens; . | being gay; . | holding your newborn child; . | being underwater; . | the tastes of certain foods; . | being dumped; . | having an addiction; . | having depression, anxiety, stress, or any other type of mental illness; . | being an identical twin; and . | falling in love (incidentally, Norwegians have a word, Forelsket, which means “the indescribable euphoria experienced as you begin to fall in love”). . | . In such cases, no amount of explanation can convey the depth of experience. Words aren’t enough. You wouldn’t understand. . Such hard-to-communicate knowledge is known as tacit knowledge. All our consultants gain tacit knowledge by doing method marketing. They become a customer and live the life of the customer. So by the time they begin copywriting, they are writing from the heart. Of course, they then face the challenge of communicating their tacit knowledge, trying to welcome outsiders into the club. That’s why copywriting is hard. But at least they are trying to persuade the visitors from the perspective of a knowledgeable insider&mdash;not a naive outsider. . As proof of how valuable we think this technique is, the following images show examples of how much commitment we put into it. . . To sell Dysons, use Dysons. As part of our research program, we use our clients’ products. . . Getting under the skin of the customers. . Why are we wearing superhero suits? We helped the company Morphsuits to win an award for fast growth. Morphsuits became the eighteenth fastest growing company in the United Kingdom, and its directors were invited to Richard Branson’s house to collect their Sunday Times Fast Track awards. The previous photo shows us testing out our fancy dress Morphsuits. It’s hard to persuade someone to buy a Lycra bodysuit unless you have personally experienced its benefits (“When you’re wearing a Morphsuit, things just happen”)&mdash;and you have managed to overcome your own objections. . The following photo shows some antibodies that we had ordered from a client that sold scientific supplies. We weren’t able to test the antibodies. In fact, we were wary about going anywhere near them. But during the unboxing process, we noticed some valuable information that was wrongly absent from the website. . . By following the buying process for these clinical antibodies, we discovered opportunities for growing the client’s sales. . . If we aren’t the target customer, we find someone who is. At this point, marketing becomes anthropology. . . To truly understand a product, we become real users. Some products&mdash;like this fitness program&mdash;require more effort and commitment than others. . . You can only truly understand some products&mdash;like food supplements&mdash;once you have made them part of your life. . There should be no exceptions to this rule. When one of our consultants was uncomfortable joining a dating website to understand how the whole process worked, our cofounder Karl stepped in. Karl stopped short of going on a date, but the process revealed many insights&mdash;including the fact that Karl’s “datability index” was 40%. (Karl insists that this indicated the presence of a major bug in the website’s rating algorithm.) . . We did make one exception to our rule: When growing a company that sold houses, we visited one of the company’s sales offices and followed the whole customer journey. But we stopped short of buying a house, a decision we now regret. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-39&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using method marketing with offline competitors (because the offline world often has solved problems that the online world hasn’t) . You can learn a lot from carrying out method marketing with competitors, particularly with offline ones. Most online businesses have offline equivalents that you can visit. Offline companies are less subject to ivory-tower syndrome than online companies, because they have face-to-face contact with customers. Their sales funnels tend to be more sophisticated. . The following photo shows us carrying out grueling research at the local bingo hall. . . The onboarding process for offline bingo gave us many ideas for growing an online bingo company. . We learned that offline bingo is excellent regarding usability. Offline bingo halls have solved many problems that online bingo still hadn’t solved. New players were led through an elegant onboarding process that introduced them to every type of game and service. The onboarding flow turned out to be just as applicable to online bingo as it was to offline. . Finally, we have helped to grow several clients in weight loss, including MyFitnessPal, one of the world’s most-downloaded mobile apps for weight loss, which we mentioned sold for almost half a billion dollars. Many techniques we learned by attending offline weight-loss groups. The great thing about weight-loss groups is that you can speak with real customers. In fact, that’s what the meeting is&mdash;a one-hour discussion group. . The following photos show Karl starting and finishing a weight-loss program. He adopted the traditional before-and-after poses. . . Left: Karl at the first weigh-in, doing the traditional “before” pose. Right:&nbsp;Not so humble now, Karl strutting around like he owns the place, after proudly receiving his Slimmer of the Month award. The activity gave us insights that we have used to grow many clients in the weight-loss industry. (Karl’s subsequent fall from grace is not pictured.) . He lost thirty-two pounds and gained even more insights. . Then he regained the pounds. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-2&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…becoming a face-to-face salesperson (to learn how to sell the product) . Your website is effectively your 24/7 robot salesperson. And the robot is no smarter than its inventor. If you can’t sell your products in person, you’ll struggle to sell them online. . Method marketing helps, but it allows you to understand only one customer (yourself). The best way to understand many customers well&mdash;albeit not quite so deeply&mdash;is to sell the product face-to-face. . In 2003 our founders, Ben and Karl, ran a web business called Mobal that provided cell phones to travelers. Mobal had a large Japanese presence, so Nokia asked Mobal to set up and manage Japan’s first bricks-and-mortar Nokia store. We took on the project because we relished the opportunity for our team to spend time selling face-to-face with our visitors. . . By opening and running Japan’s first Nokia store, we learned rich insights that helped us to triple the sales of an online phone store. . Once the store was open, we created a spreadsheet for our team to complete. It contained two columns: . Column 1: Objections. To this column, our team members added all the objections that they heard from visitors. For example, visitors would say, “Instead of buying one of these phones, I will save money by buying a local prepaid SIM card when I arrive in my destination country.” . | Column 2: Counterobjections. To this column, our team members added the responses that they found to be the most effective. For example, in response to the objection above, we would reply: “If you buy a local prepaid SIM card at your destination, you won’t know your phone number until you arrive, so your friends and family won’t know how to contact you.” . | . The spreadsheet of objections and counterobjections became our knowledge base of tried-and-tested sales copy. We incorporated its content into the website, to great success; we more than doubled the conversion rate and the revenue of the business. . Usually, though, you can’t open a bricks-and-mortar store. The following example is from the other end of the scrappiness spectrum. While developing a new type of SIM card for world phones, we realized that we had spent too much time in our office ivory tower. So we visited a local flea market, where we spent several hours trying to sell the new prototype product face-to-face. . . If you don’t have an offline store, create one. Flea markets are an easy way to get in front of users quickly. . At first, we told our stall’s visitors that we were carrying out market research and that we wanted to hear their feedback. This had two problems: (1) people didn’t want to speak about market research, and (2) those who did tended to give responses that were polite and false. Only when we tried to close the sale did we hear their true objections. So from then on, we tried to sell in earnest (even though our prime motive was to gather feedback). If a visitor showed interest, we would take down their name so we could notify them when the product became available. . This activity became a core part of our process for developing new products. Because our product was aimed at travelers, we soon graduated from flea markets to airports, where we would rent space for an exhibition stand. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-40&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…seeing how others describe it in writing (because their words are likely to reveal a lot) . The closer you are to a business, the more you have the “curse of knowledge,” the cognitive bias that makes it hard to see things through the eyes of those less experienced. It can help to read how other people have tried to describe your product. The following methods are often useful: . Read Wikipedia: If your company, your product, or the generic type of product has a page on Wikipedia, then study the words that the writers have used. Wikipedia articles are usually excellent in terms of intelligibility, which is particularly important for products that are technical or complex. We have seen several products for which the Wikipedia page was clearer and more persuasive than the company’s official landing page. (We once tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade a client to point some of its AdWords traffic at its Wikipedia page.) . | Read reviews: Reviews on online stores like Amazon reveal a lot about the buyers’ psychology&mdash;particularly their likes and dislikes. Pay attention to the wording used in the reviews. . | Look for places where customers sell the product to others: There’s no purer copywriting than when buyers recommend products to their friends. Search Twitter and Facebook for instances of customers recommending your product to their followers. If your company has a tell-a-friend program that allows the customers to send a personalized message to their friends, then those messages can be a great source of sales copy. (Check first that you are OK to analyze those messages without breaking any laws or terms and conditions.) Not only do the messages reveal the persuasive arguments, but they also tell you the exact wording that customers use. By analyzing the frequency of words used, you can establish the lexicon you should use in your copywriting. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-3&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…talking to a “VOC aggregator” (perhaps the fastest way to understand users) . What VOC aggregators are, and why you need to find yours . According to Paul Graham of Y Combinator, to grow an early stage web business, you should spend all of your waking hours on the following three activities: . Build the product. . | Talk to users. . | Exercise. . | . We agree. We spend a good fraction of our time talking with our clients’ users. It’s priceless, but it’s also time-consuming. . So we also talk to people who spend their whole lives speaking with users. For example, salespeople, consultants, and customer-support staff. We call these people “Voice-of-Customer Aggregators” (or “VOC aggregators”). VOC aggregators already understand the users. And they don’t just know facts like “The average user is forty years old with 2.4 children”; they know the users intuitively, much like you know your own family. In fact, they can often second-guess how the users would react to a particular idea. Plus, because they speak with so many users, they know the relative importance of each issue. When you talk to a VOC aggregator, you harness the wisdom of thousands of hours of conversations with users. . Of course, you still need to talk to users. But you can accelerate your understanding by identifying your market’s VOC aggregators and then talking to them. . With this in mind, here’s the updated formula: . Build the product. . | Talk to users&mdash;and to people who talk to users. . | Exercise. . | . How to benefit from VOC aggregation . Here’s what you can do: . Identify your own industry’s VOC aggregators. They may be resellers, consultants, telesales people, customer-support people. They may work for your company or for other companies in the same supply chain. They may work for online companies, mail-order companies, or bricks-and-mortar companies. So, for example, when we work for manufacturers of consumer electronics, we spend a lot of time speaking with the staff of bricks-and-mortar electronics stores. . | Talk to them. Ask them how they would sell your product. Their approach is likely to mirror the logic of how their customers buy. . | Implement as much of their feedback as you can. Add the rest to your product road map and marketing road map. . | While we were working with Sony, we visited a store that sold its devices. The shop assistant was great at selling the product. . She sold several of the devices each week, and she knew the answers to all the questions that visitors asked. We asked her for her views on the product’s website, which she knew well because she had studied it when searching for answers to her visitors’ questions. She described twenty-two facts that her visitors needed to know but that weren’t mentioned on the company’s website. We incorporated these facts into the webpage, making it much more persuasive. . For many products, the salespeople hold decision trees in their heads. What they say depends on how visitors answered the previous questions. In such cases, you should map out the decision trees, consolidate them, and then turn them into conversion flows. We did exactly this for a blue-chip financial services company. After speaking with its call center team, we made changes that resulted in a 214% increase in orders. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-41&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…encouraging your visitors to phone you (so you can understand them better) . If your phone number is displayed prominently on your pages, speak with your inbound telesales team or whoever answers the calls. They will already understand your visitors deeply, with a level of empathy you could never get from a survey tool. In fact, you may well discover that your page should be a distilled version of words and logic that the salesperson says to the callers. . If the price of your product is low, you may find that it’s economically unviable to invite phone calls. Regardless, we still recommend you add a phone number for just a day or so, for research purposes. The first few phone calls can reveal breakthrough insights. Not only do phone calls help you to understand your visitors, but they also help you to understand yourself. A phone call can be an “intuition pump”&mdash;on the phone, you’ll find yourself intuitively using words and logic that you hadn’t thought to write on your pages. Just as stand-up comedians come up with many of their best lines while performing in front of an audience, you’ll find that much of your best sales copy comes while you are selling on the phone or in person, one-to-one. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-4&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…creating&mdash;and then studying&mdash;a knowledge base of answers to your visitors’ questions (to manage the long tail of obstacles) . Knowledge base software helps you to corral users’ questions and to organize your responses. By studying the knowledge base, you can understand your visitors’ intentions, their likes, their objections, and your most effective counterobjections. Plus, the knowledge base doesn’t just help you gain insight; it helps visitors to convert. . Tools for knowledge bases . The following knowledge base solutions are popular: Intercom, Help Scout, Zendesk, KnowledgeOwl, Moxie, Helpjuice, and Freshdesk. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-42&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…running user tests (to see your pages’ shortcomings firsthand) . We carry out user tests every day. They are an amazing way to get deep, granular insights into your pages&mdash;and to identify exactly how you can make them convert better. . A user test (or usability test) involves observing someone using your website and noting any issues that arise. User testing is not rocket science&mdash;in fact, it’s mundane&mdash;but it’s perhaps the most powerful technique in this book. . How to identify your usability problems using usability tests . There are several ways to carry out user tests. Most involve the following: . Giving participants tasks to carry out . | Watching in silence as they complete them . | Asking them about their thoughts . | Recording the results for later analysis . | How to recruit people to user test your website . Ideally, your participants would be people who represent your target market. However, at first, you can get great results by testing on whoever’s at hand. Those people sitting near you right now&mdash;they’ll do. Or a family member. This practice has a name: hallway usability testing&mdash;which makes it sound more legitimate than it feels when you’re doing it. Hallway usability tests are effective because many usability problems are so obvious they could be detected by anyone. . Once you sense that you’re getting diminishing returns from your hallway antics, and your website’s remaining problems are too sophisticated to be detected by a layman, start to look for test participants who are from the website’s target demographic. For example, when we doubled the sales of a web app for photographers, we recruited photographers to test the website. You can recruit visitors directly from the website using an invitation powered by Ethnio or Hotjar. . It can be surprisingly effective to carry out what we call retrospective moderated user tests, in which you contact someone who has just completed your website’s goal (e.g., made a purchase), and ask them if they’d be willing to retrace their steps. Such people are, by definition, qualified, and have recently gone through all of the thought processes required to buy. Take notes as they show you the path they took through your funnel, and ask them to describe what they thought at each stage. They tend to be excellent at recalling the hoops they had to jump through and the obstacles at which they nearly fell. . Counterintuitively, regardless of which of the previous methods you choose for recruiting, you tend to learn more from users who aren’t web-savvy. People who use the web a lot tend to be better at coping with pages that contain errors. People who don’t use the web much are more easily derailed&mdash;and can therefore provide more insights. . How to carry out a user test . If the participants aren’t from your exact target market, tell them anything they need to imagine: . Do they need to pretend they are someone else? For example, if you were working on the website of a car manufacturer, you might say to the test participant, “Imagine that you owned a car made by [company name].” . | Do they need to pretend they are in a particular situation? For example, you may need to say, “Imagine that you are an existing customer and your car has broken down.” . | . Then, give them the task you’d like them to complete. The task is usually a typical goal of the website. For example, if your website sells quirky gifts, the task might be “Add to your basket some smoking mittens, some metal-detecting sandals, and a photo-realistic bacon scarf” (those are all real products, amazingly). You may choose to set the goal in general terms or specifically, depending on whether you want to exclude certain possibilities: . To consider all possibilities, you may state the goal implicitly: “Imagine that your car has broken down. What would you do next?” (About ten years ago, we carried out a user test in which the participant, to our surprise, asked for a Yellow Pages, and didn’t even consider using a computer.) . | To be more specific, you may choose to state the goal in general terms: “How would you get your car repaired?” . | You may choose to state the goal specifically: “Assume you have typed [search terms] into Google and clicked on the first search result. You arrive on this page. How would you find the location of your nearest repair center?” . | . Encourage criticism. The participant needs to know that you won’t take criticism personally. We sometimes find it helps to pretend that the website was designed by someone else, and that we aren’t happy with it. That way, the user feels more comfortable criticizing it. . You want the visit to be as natural as possible. Tell them that once they have started the task, you’ll stay quiet and watch, and you’ll refrain from helping unless they really need you. . During the test, take notes. You’ll soon have a huge list of ideas for improving your website. Most tests provide something worthwhile, and it’s rare to go more than three tests without getting an idea that’s so important you’ll want to stop everything until it’s implemented. . Steve Krug, the author of a great book called Don’t Make Me Think, has a useful script (a Word document) for carrying out user tests. The script was designed for user tests in labs, so you may want to ignore the references to microphones and screen recordings. . The hardest thing about user testing is the emotional aspect. Not only can they feel awkward, but also they can make you want to cry. Because the truth hurts. For that reason, most marketers shy away from them. The best marketers are those who rapidly accept the criticism, use it to improve the page, and then user test again. . How to outsource your user testing . If you are too busy&mdash;or introverted&mdash;to carry out usability tests, you can pay for a service to do unmoderated user tests for you. Here’s how the services typically work: . You tell the service which page you want to test. . | You select the type of users that you’d like to participate. . | You specify what the user’s task should be. . | After a delay, usually of a few hours, you will receive videos of users carrying out the task. . | The following services provide unmoderated user tests: . UserTesting, Validately, Userlytics, TryMyUI, UserBob, and Userbrain. . | Lookback is similar, but you provide the participants (you might choose to send your existing customers to it). . | UsersThink and userinput are low-cost alternatives that provide written reports instead of videos. . | UsabilityHub allows you to carry out tests for free, provided that, in exchange, you complete other people’s tests. . | Watchsend is for iPhone apps. . | Testapic provides a user testing service in French; uxline does it in Spanish; Testaisso does it in Portuguese. . | . To learn more about usability testing, see the talk, “How to make millions from usability testing,” which you can find on our website. . Tools for recording the screen during user tests . You can use one of the following to record your screen during a user test: Camtasia, ScreenFlow, Jing, Morae, Silverback, and UX Recorder (for iOS websites). Some of those tools can also simultaneously record video from the webcam, so you can capture the users’ facial expressions (frustration, confusion, despondency, etc.). . How to identify usability problems caused by technical errors . One type of usability problem occurs when the website malfunctions. This is particularly common when the visitor is using an uncommon device or browser version&mdash;or when the page is new. The solution is to follow a robust quality-assurance process before any page goes live. Smashing Magazine’s list of “45 web design checklists and questionnaires” can be useful. . Session-recording software can help a lot with finding such problems. Options include Clicktale, Inspectlet, Hotjar, and Tealeaf&mdash;all of which also help to identify problems with online forms. . Other tools and services for user testing . You might also want to check out the following tools for user testing: . Loop11, UsabilityHub, and UserZoom are useful. . | Mechanical Turk can be used to find participants. . | Pear Note and Reframer help you to write notes while observing a user test. . | . If you are a usability expert, Capian can help you to create reports of your expert reviews. . | The Accessibility Priority Tool is a spreadsheet that scores different aspects of a website’s usability and accessibility. . | . There’s a great benefit in carrying out at least a few user tests yourself . Whichever tools and services you use, we highly recommend that you (and everyone else who creates pages for your website) should carry out at least a few tests. By testing in-person, you can ask questions of the users. You can even propose solutions to their objections, and collaborate with them on the solutions. . We talk more about user testing in an article called “How to eliminate the usability problems that stifle your growth,” which you can find on our website. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-6&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using eye tracking (to identify where your visitors are looking) . Just because something is on your page doesn’t mean that anyone looks at it. While your users are participating in user tests, you can track their eye movements using an eye-tracking apparatus. . . Users’ gaze is influenced by surrounding cues. For example, they tend to look at whatever the person on the page is looking at. (Image credit: Objective and Tobii.) . Eye tracking is great for understanding how users look at webpages. The data from a browsing session can be converted into a movie of the user’s eye movements, or displayed as a static chart like a heat map or movement map. . Professional eye-tracking hardware tends to cost thousands of dollars. However, a service called EyesDecide allows you to get low-cost eye-tracking reports on demand. The service works much like the user testing tools mentioned above, but includes eye-tracking reports that it gathers via its users’ webcams. . . Eye tracking can reveal what your visitors see and what they don’t. The headline of the right-hand page is more compelling, causing visitors to read on. (Image credit: EyesDecide.) . EyeQuant and Feng-GUI use a computer algorithm to predict your visitors’ eye tracking, based on the contrast and layout of the page elements. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-44&quot;&gt; Diagnose by…using pop-up surveys (to recruit participants for your user tests) . Once you have fixed the more obvious problems with your website, it’s time to carry out some user tests on qualified prospects&mdash;that is, people who actually visit your website. . A software platform called Ethnio provides an easy way of recruiting people for user tests. In this chapter, we’ll describe its features. Hotjar has this feature too, and you could probably create the same functionality using a combination of other tools. . Once Ethnio is installed on your website, you can use it to easily display a pop-up survey that asks your visitors if they’d like to participate in a user test. You can target the survey to specific types of visitors&mdash;for example, those who use a particular browser or are in a specific geolocation. You can design the survey to ask questions that will help you to determine whether you want to interview the person. For example, you may ask them why they visited your website and whether this is their first visit. . . A overlay inviting users to participate in a user test. . To incentivize people to participate in your tests, you’ll probably need to offer a reward. We like to reward people with gift cards from Amazon.com, because they are quick to send and they require only the recipient’s email address. Also, visitors instantly recognize them as being valuable&mdash;they’re clearly not some sneaky voucher that’s full of weasel clauses and restrictions. With an incentive, about 5% of visitors tend to respond, though this varies greatly from industry to industry. . People’s willingness to participate in user tests depends on which type of market you’re in; visitors to some types of website&mdash;such as financial services or health issues&mdash;tend to be reluctant to start a conversation. In other markets, visitors love to get involved. . Once visitors have completed the survey, their details appear in a table in Ethnio’s or Hotjar’s interface. You can then decide whether you’d like to carry out a user test with them. . . Ethnio’s control panel allows you to manage your user tests. (Image credit: Ethnio.) . You can interview them however you like&mdash;by phone (with screen-sharing software such as join.me, Zoom, GoToMeeting) or in person. Ethnio can also help you to set up the call. . Bear in mind that the people who want to be interviewed are self-selecting; they don’t necessarily represent your average visitor. In particular, they may be more time-rich and cash-poor than your average visitor. However, they still tend to be much more qualified than your average user testing participant. . It can help to record the phone call. To do so, you’ll need to get the user’s permission. .

A/B testing software allows you to create different variations of a page and then measure which converts best. You can then promote the winning page to become your official new version. . A/B testing doesn’t generate many insights. However, it does give the final word on whether your insights and intuitions were accurate. A winning A/B test is your visitors voting with their feet (and often their credit cards). . For further information on A/B testing, see a report we wrote titled “A/B testing 101.” Also, we recommend you read the help files for whatever A/B testing software you use. The help files tend to be written well, and their advice will be correct for that software and whichever methods and algorithms it uses. . Tools for A/B testing . Popular platforms include Optimizely, Google Optimize, VWO, Convert.com, and Adobe Target. There are many alternatives, though. We created the industry’s first and most comprehensive comparison website for them. It compares software solutions for split-testing&mdash;A/B testing and multivariate testing&mdash;allowing you to see the differences easily. . . Our comprehensive summary of A/B testing tools. . How to measure what’s working if your website doesn’t get much traffic . In the chapter on low-traffic websites, we explained how it can be difficult to measure what’s working on low-traffic websites, because A/B tests often don’t reach significance. . Many people with low traffic websites thus believe that testing isn’t suitable for them. . But that isn’t the case. Done correctly, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be testing often on your website and realizing all the benefits that go with it. . How many conversions do you need for A/B testing? It depends on the following factors: . Your current conversion rate. The fewer conversions you get, the longer it takes to detect a doubling. . | The increase in conversion rate that you’re trying to detect. A 100% increase can be detected about four times as fast as a 50% increase. . | How statistically confident you want to be. If you wanted to be 99.99% sure that your new page wasn’t winning just by chance, you’d have to wait a long time. . | So what should a low-traffic website do? Several strategies are effective: . Test the biggest, boldest ideas. When you have low traffic, it’s especially important to test big, bold ideas that are more likely to move the needle significantly. Test things that your visitors care about. Overcome their main objections. Highlight the things they love. Change the offer, or at least how it’s presented. Test things that might double or halve the number of conversions, but are unlikely to make no difference. . | Measure “micro-conversions.” Imagine conversion goals as a spectrum. On the right-hand side of the spectrum is what you ideally want&mdash;something like net profit or lifetime customer value. Such metrics tend to be untimely, meaning that you’d take months or years to measure their true value. On the left-hand side of the spectrum lie metrics like click-through rate or engagement rate. Such “intermediate” metrics are much larger in number and can be measured instantly, but you can’t be confident that they correlate with overall long-term success. The less traffic your website gets, the more you need to rely on “intermediate” metrics toward the left-hand side of the spectrum. . | Test on major pages. Maybe this one is obvious, but test only those pages that almost all of your customers see, like your main landing page or your checkout funnel. . | Combine similar pages into one test. If you have ten landing pages, and you want to test the call-to-action button, then apply the same change to all of those pages and include them in the same test. Some companies have many more landing pages than they need, maybe because they wanted to make each landing page bespoke to a particular keyword. We often consolidate such pages into one, and then optimize the heck out of it. . | Reduce the statistical significance at which you’ll declare a winner. It has become the norm to declare a winning test at a statistical significance of 95%, but that’s not to say you can’t use a different figure. It would be a shame to conclude that “If I can’t have 95% confidence, I won’t run an A/B test at all.” That’s like saying, “I’m a perfectionist. If I can’t do it perfectly, I won’t do it at all.” Most marketing decisions are made without any measurement, so don’t rule out the possibility of ending a test at, say, 90% confidence&mdash;or even 85% confidence&mdash;especially if the alternative is just to launch the page and hope for the best. Sure, your chances of declaring false positives increase slightly, but the benefits of being able to test more ideas usually hugely outweighs the slim risk of promoting a page that was actually losing. . | Fixed-period testing. Many A/B testing tools now monitor your tests on an ongoing basis and tell you when there’s a winner. In addition, though, you may choose to specify a maximum duration for each test, after which you’ll make a decision regardless. If the control was winning at that point, you may choose to promote it. If the challenger was winning, and you’re confident that it was based on a research-driven hypothesis, then you may choose to promote it. If the challenger was based on a risky hypothesis, you may choose not to take the risk. Either way, this approach is more rigorous than how most early stage companies make decisions. . | Temporarily increase the amount of traffic to the page being tested, even if it means sacrificing some profitability. If the new page wins, the traffic may turn out to be more profitable than you had expected. . | You can estimate how long an A/B test would take by using a calculator like Optimizely’s. . Regardless of whether you carry out A/B tests, we highly recommend you use user tests as a way of measuring the performance of pages. In fact, if the A/B test duration calculator shows that all of your tests would take more than six months, we recommend you use only user tests, and return to A/B testing once your business has grown. . User tests have many, huge advantages over A/B tests: . They are quick to carry out. A user test can take less than ten minutes. . | They allow you to gather qualitative insights. A two-month-long A/B test may tell you which page performed better, but a ten-minute-long user test tells you why. . | They provide insights that are granular. An A/B test will only reveal which page is better&mdash;that’s just one fact about the whole page&mdash;but a user test will reveal which parts of the page work. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-46&quot;&gt; Know your market by…analyzing your competitors (to see what they have learned about their visitors) . Although it’s not our favorite technique, it can be useful to analyze the websites of your competitors, for two reasons: . You may find that they have recognized&mdash;and solved&mdash;a problem that you haven’t. . | You need to work out how you will position your company relative to your competitors. After all, your visitors will be looking at your competitors’ websites too. No company exists in a vacuum. . | You may wish to also carry out user tests on your competitors’ websites, to get an independent view on how users perceive them. . You can learn a lot from your competitors. But to beat them, you’ll need to do things they don’t. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-7&quot;&gt; Why each of the techniques for understanding your visitors is like a spotlight . Now that you know the techniques for understanding your visitors, try to identify which combination of them will give you the insights you need. . As in many fields of creativity, it helps to have a spirit of experimentation. Don’t give up because your first attempt did not reveal insights. Each technique and each question is like a spotlight that shines light on a different aspect of your visitors’ behavior. The more information you gather, the more problems and opportunities you will spot. . You might, for example, discover that your visitors’ main objection is that they don’t trust you. Or that you don’t provide what they want. Or that they like what they see, but they are just browsing. . How do you remedy those problems? . You look them up in Section 3, that’s how… . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-47&quot;&gt; Section 3: Problems and solutions. The most common reasons web visitors abandon&mdash;and proven, easy-to-implement fixes . . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-9&quot;&gt; The ingredients of a winning website . At the end of Section 1, we described the DiPS (Diagnose → Problem → Solution) formula for improving websites. . We explained how you need to begin with diagnosis, to identify how your website can be improved. . Then, in Section 2, we described many of the diagnosis techniques we use. After implementing just a few of them, you’ll have a big list of identified problems (which you may prefer to think of as opportunities). . This section is about implementing solutions to those problems (opportunities). A good solution is one that eliminates the problem entirely, unblocking your website’s profits like that gloopy stuff unblocks the hairs from a shower drain&mdash;and in a manner that’s no less satisfying. . Fortunately, not all blockages are unique. During the hundreds of research projects we have carried out, we have identified the major categories into which most problems fall. Your company’s biggest problem will almost certainly be among them. Each of the following chapters is dedicated to one of those problems. Some of them are subtle; if you miss them, or fail to recognize their scope, you could waste time working on the wrong aspect of your business. (We see this happen a lot.) By reading each chapter, you’ll become better at spotting each problem when you see it in research data. . Here’s how to use this section of the book: Refer to your research to identify which problem is causing your visitors to abandon your website. Then, skip to the corresponding chapter, which will explain how to think about the problem, and will then describe some proven, effective ways of fixing it. Of course, there are many ways to overcome each problem. For example, there are over a hundred ways of overcoming lack of trust, and some of them are much more effective than others. For each problem, we will describe strategies that we’ve found to be robust&mdash;that tend to work reliably in most situations. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-49&quot;&gt; Winning websites…are written well: if visitors can’t understand your writing, here’s how to improve it . Why you should learn to write clearly&mdash;and why so few people are good at it . When we ask a website’s visitors why they didn’t buy, they often report that they were confused. They hadn’t understood the words on the website. And visitors can’t buy what they can’t understand. . So, with millions of dollars at stake, why are many websites confusing? . Because writing intelligibly is harder than it sounds. For example, read the following sentence from a popular newspaper, written by an otherwise great writer: . “Dance music aficionados can argue interminably over which of the legendary singles Frankie Knuckles produced in the late 80s&mdash;singles, you can say without fear of contradiction, that played a part in changing the face of pop music for ever&mdash;is the best.” . That sentence is free of typos and punctuation errors. And it uses sophisticated words accurately. According to many rules of English, it’s written well. . Yet most people struggle to understand it, let alone work out what’s wrong with it, or how to fix it. . It’s hard to write clearly. In fact, it’s hard to find someone who can teach you how to write clearly. Schools tend to spend more time teaching pupils how to sound smart, or how to analyze Shakespearian prose, than how to be understood. Students are more likely to be told to memorize poetry than to carry out a readability test. . This is a disservice. Poetry can be life-enriching, but the purpose of almost all writing is to communicate information. . So if your school didn’t teach you how to write intelligibly, how can you learn? . This chapter describes some fantastic resources for helping you to write more clearly. They have helped us to generate hundreds of millions for our clients. It’s hard to overstate how useful they are. . But first, let’s explore why so many writers are hard to understand. . Many books teach you to avoid errors, but that’s not the problem . When most people want to improve their writing, they buy a book like “Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation,” which is about how to avoid making mistakes. Such books describe rules like the following: . “When there are parentheses at the end of a sentence, put the period after the closing parenthesis (like this).” . | “If your whole sentence is in parentheses, put the period inside the closing parenthesis. (Like this.)” . | . Such rules may be useful to know, but they make little difference to whether your readers understand what you are saying. . Many teachers specialize in sounding intelligent; if you follow their advice, your sales will plummet . Many teachers encourage writing in what Richard Lanham calls the “Official Style”&mdash;a style that sounds intelligent but that is hard to read. Lanham’s book Revising Prose teaches you how to translate Official-Style sentences into plain language. It contains a great example of how Warren Buffett, the world’s most-famous investor, translated a fund prospectus into plain language. Buffett changed hard-to-read sentences like… . “Adjustments made to shorten portfolio maturity and duration are made to limit capital losses during periods when interest rates are expected to rise” . into easy-to-read text: . “When we expect a major and sustained increase in rates, we will concentrate on short-term issues.” . No wonder fellow investors hang on Buffett’s every word. . The Official Style is prevalent in academic literature too. On the website LOL My Thesis, graduates self-deprecatingly translate the titles of their theses from the Official Style into plain language&mdash;usually to comic effect: . Original title of thesis: “Environmental enrichment and the striatum: The influence of environment on inhibitory circuitry within the striatum of environmentally enriched animals and behavioural consequences.” Rewritten title: “Having toys and bright colours in their cages makes mice smarter in their brains!” . | Original title of thesis: “Challenging ritual and exploring deposition within the canals of Chavín de Huántar.” Rewritten title: “Ancient Peruvians threw stuff down a drain: maybe it was ritual, probably just trash.” . | Original title of thesis: “The Punch Brothers’ The Blind Leaving the Blind: how heterogeneous stylistic techniques provide new interpretations of genre.” Rewritten title: “A band that detests genre classifications is just gonna have to put up with it.” . | . The rewritten titles are facetious, and many of them omit useful information. But they also reveal a truth: The Official Style is like medieval armor. It defends you from attack, but people can no longer hear what you’re saying. . If you were to write your website in the Official Style, your conversion rate would bomb. Your visitors would leave confused. Teachers and bosses may like intelligent-sounding text, but readers prefer text that’s easy to understand. . How to write so that people will understand you . Faced with all this bad advice, how can you learn to write well? Clear writing is a big subject for a little chapter, so in this chapter we describe several tools and techniques that will help immensely&mdash;and then we recommend some resources that will transform your life with just a few hours’ effort. . A simple technique that helps you to write easy-to-read copy . By far the most effective technique for improving your writing is simple: carry out readability tests. A readability test is simply a user test carried out specifically on a piece of writing. . If you run readability tests on everything you write, you’ll quickly become aware of how your readers struggle. Make a note of every point at which they falter, and then fix it. You can make the fixes during the test, or afterward, depending on how much fixing there is to do, and how quick you are at editing. . Speak first, write later . If you struggle to write clearly, you will find the following workaround useful. One of our clients, a company called Moz, had a common problem. Moz’s founder, Rand Fishkin, mentioned that in seven minutes he could persuade almost anyone to sign up. So face-to-face, Rand’s conversion rate was high. But he was frustrated that his website’s conversion rate was much lower. . We asked Rand to film himself saying what he would say during those seven minutes. . . Rand Fishkin was masterful at selling his company’s service face-to-face&mdash;so we recorded him doing it. . We transcribed the video, then used the transcript as a template for the company’s new landing page. And we embedded the video itself into the page. . The new page beat the old one, with a 52% higher conversion rate during the A/B test. Rand reported that, in total, we almost tripled his company’s conversion rate. (If you’d like to learn more about this project, see the detailed case study we wrote about it.) . Many people find that their spoken English is easier to understand than their written English. If you are one of those people, try the following workflow: . Record yourself. . | Get the recording transcribed. We highly recommend Speechpad for fast, accurate transcription. . | Edit your transcript and incorporate it into your website. . | A/B test the new page to confirm that your changes have increased your profits. . | . Be aware of the reader’s memory buffer . To make your writing easy to understand, there’s one principle above all others that you should understand: You should be constantly aware of the reader’s memory buffer. As a person reads, his or her brain constantly processes and interprets the incoming words. In doing so, it loads the words into a short-term memory&mdash;a buffer&mdash;and then discharges them when the meaning has been understood. . The buffer memory is surprisingly small&mdash;it struggles to hold more than about fifteen words. Fortunately, most sentences contain frequent resolution points, at which the meaning can be understood and the buffer unloaded. In the following examples, we have labeled with pipes (“|”) the main resolution points&mdash;the points at which the words in the buffer can be interpreted. We have also labeled, in ever-fading shades, the points at which the short-term memory has gone too long without a break. . Dance music aficionados| can argue interminably over| which of the legendary singles Frankie Knuckles produced in the late 80s&mdash;singles, you can say without fear of contradiction, that played a part in changing the face of pop music for ever&mdash;is the best.| . The pipes feel like points at which your brain gets to “take a breath.” When you read the faded words, you may get the same panicky feeling that you get when you are diving underwater and you are starting to run out of oxygen. By the time you reach the final pipe, your short-term memory is gasping. . The following text contains another example of the same phenomenon: . To pass the Bechdel test,| a movie must have at least two female characters| who are named| and talk to each other| about something other than a man.| . Pulp Fiction, all three movies of the original Star Wars trilogy, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, The Social Network, Avatar, and Finding Nemo reportedly fail the test.| . To understand where those resolution points (the pipes) lie, you could study linguistic parse trees. However, they are hard to learn. Fortunately, there’s an easier way. With a few minutes’ practice, you’ll discover that you can sense it, just by reading a sentence word by word, and noting the points at which your understanding resolves. . (Incidentally, dependency length is the number of words during which the reader needs to “hold their breath” before they can reach a resolution point.) . If you aim to go easy on your readers’ memory buffers, the following priceless rules of thumb emerge. . Keep sentences short . You can enforce resolution points by keeping sentences short. A period is a resolution point. As you become more sophisticated, you’ll discover that certain types of long sentences are fine, provided they have what’s called right-branched clauses, like this one, or this one, or even this one. . Get to the verb quickly . In each sentence, minimize the distance between the start of the subject and the end of the verb. In the example above, we mentioned the following sentence: “Pulp Fiction, all three movies of the original Star Wars trilogy, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, The Social Network, Avatar, and Finding Nemo reportedly fail the test.” You could improve it by moving the verb fail to the start: “The following movies reportedly fail the test|: The original Star Wars trilogy|, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II|, Pulp Fiction|, The Social Network|, Avatar|, and Finding Nemo.|” . Cut fluff . “Omit needless words,” advised Strunk and White. Buffer memory is the reason. Needless words don’t just waste time; they make ideas too big to fit in buffer memories. . Replace nominalizations with action verbs . Nominalizations are where verbs are stated as though they were nouns. So, for example, . Meet becomes a meeting. . | Investigated becomes an investigation. . | Tested becomes a test. . | . Nominalizations are bad because they require a (usually meaningless) verb, like had, plus prepositions to link them: . Meet becomes had a meeting. (What was being had?) . | Investigated becomes held an investigation. (What was being held?) . | Tested becomes carried out a test. (What was carried?) . | . You can spot nominalizations by looking for verbs that aren’t really describing what’s happening (like had, held, and carried in the sentences above). The verb to be is the most common culprit. If you ever see to be (or variants like is and was), you’ll probably find a more action-ey verb hiding nearby, maybe inside a noun. Ask yourself, what is actually being done here? For example, when you see the following sentence: . My recommendation is to carry out an improvement initiative on the website . the word is indicates that the verb is hiding elsewhere. In this case, the verb is recommend, and it’s hiding in the word recommendation. You should rewrite the sentence as follows: . I recommend we carry out an improvement initiative on the website. . But even that isn’t going far enough. In the sentence above, is anything really being “carried out”? No, the presence of the words “carry out” reveal that another verb is hiding somewhere. In this case, the verb is improve, and it has buried itself in the noun phrase improvement initiative. You should further rewrite the sentence as follows: . I recommend we improve the website. . And so, we have converted a twelve-word sentence into a six-word one. The readers’ memory buffers will thank us for it. . If in doubt, use the following sentence structure . The human brain is great at understanding sentences that have the following structure: . The woman threw the ball to the dog. . In other words… . A living entity does something (maybe to something else, preferably another living entity). . Next time you are struggling to write a sentence, try writing it in that format. For most conversion copywriting, the living entities should be you (the reader) and we (the company). . When you first try it, you’ll feel like it isn’t going to work. You’ll be surprised how often it does. . A few more tips for writing good sentences . The following tips can improve any sentence: . Make abstract sentences concrete. Ask yourself, “If I were making a movie of this sentence, what would I point the camera at?” And then describe that. . | Use action verbs, verbs that describe what is actually happening. . | You’d always put the punchline at the end of a joke. Similarly, put the main point of a sentence at its end. To check that you’ve done this right, read the sentence out loud and hammer your fist on the desk to emphasize the last word(s). If the words are in the wrong order, the hammering will sound silly. . Bad: The hammer test reveals that the words are in a suboptimal order in this sentence. . | Good: This sentence has its words in a better order, and so the hammer test works great. . | | If you ever find yourself italicizing a word to add emphasis, that’s a clue that the word might belong at the end of the sentence. Rearrange the sentence to put the word at the end, and see if it sounds better that way. . | If you ever find yourself putting words in brackets, that’s a clue that the words might belong in the previous sentence. . | Hemingway “makes your writing bold and clear” .

Usability problems kill conversions. . There’s no easier way to grow a business than to eliminate them. . We have described how user tests can help you to identify usability problems. In this chapter, we describe how to solve them. . Why are so many designers “usability blind”? . If you’re a sadist with a technical bent, you will enjoy running usability tests. During tests, we see users caught in wild-goose chases, scratching their heads, and sometimes swearing or even hitting their keyboards. . Why do marketers make websites that cause people to punch peripherals? Because marketers are afflicted with the curse of knowledge, a cognitive bias that makes it extremely difficult to think about a problem from the perspective of someone who’s less informed. Marketers spend so long looking at their own websites, they can’t imagine what it would be like to see the website for the first time. . As a result, the website’s users appear to be stupid. It’s a compelling illusion. But look at it another way: . Our users desired something. . | We created a website to satisfy that desire. . | And our users still can’t get what they desire. . | Now who’s stupid? . How can you overcome the curse of knowledge? Design your processes for what you perceive to be a busy, lazy, drunk, amnesiac idiot&mdash;what lawyers call a “moron in a hurry” (really). Even geniuses with time on their hands will be grateful that you did. . Why is usability hard to learn? . Usability is hard to learn because great examples are hard to detect. Usable solutions are invisibly elegant&mdash;like you never notice that you have a spleen until you have a problem with your spleen. . Also, for reasons we don’t understand, some people seem to be almost genetically predisposed to recognizing usability. And others seem to be blind to it. . How can you design pages that are easy to use? . It can take years to become great at designing easy-to-use pages. The following tips can help a lot: . 1. Watch a lot of user tests . Most people are surprised when they first watch a user test. They are surprised that the visitors see and do things they hadn’t expected. The more you watch user tests, the more you internalize the insights and become empathetic. First, you become aware of how erratic users can be. After that, you become better at second-guessing how users will behave. . 2. Watch eye-tracking sessions . Eyes don’t move the way one might expect. They move from fixation point to fixation point in rapid jumps called saccades. The more you watch eye-tracking sessions, the more you become aware of how users see (and don’t see) things. You learn the importance of controlling the users’ eye movements. . 3. Learn all the user-interface elements that are at your disposal . As you use the web, become aware of the page elements that each website uses. The best conversion practitioners have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the web. They appear to have read the whole of the internet. It comes in useful. When faced with a particular problem, it helps to be able to recall how another website has effectively solved it. We are avid collectors of effective marketing elements. Every time you see something that works well, take a screenshot of it and store it in a “swipe file” folder. Incidentally, this doesn’t just apply to the web. Our swipe file contains thousands of examples from direct mail and offline space advertising for almost every industry. . 4. Learn the most important concepts of usability . There are many good books about usability, but the following ones will teach you most of the concepts you need to know: . Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug is an excellent introduction to web usability. We passionately believe it should be on the school curriculum. . | Designed for Use by Lukas Mathis is less entertaining than Don’t Make Me Think, but it covers more usability concepts. If this book list seems worryingly short, that’s a testament to how much ground this book covers. . | The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R. Tufte contains many examples of complex data shown in beautifully elegant ways. Don’t be put off by its technical-sounding title. It’s fun to read. . | . 5. Use tools for wireframing and prototyping (so your designs can be user tested before they get coded up) . To make your designs usable, design them in a format that makes them easy to edit. (In fact, that’s true for anything you ever create.) Once you have designed a first draft, user test it on one or two people, and then incorporate your insights into the design and user test again. . In doing so, you get a frequent sanity check that you are proceeding along the right lines. . Every medium has its own low-fidelity format. Fiction writers use plot outlines. Moviemakers use storyboards. Artists use pencil outlines. And web designers use wireframes. . A wireframe shows the layout of a page, with key text, but without any detail. Most of the images in Section 3 of this book are wireframes. The most important feature of a wireframe (or of any low-fidelity format) is that it contains only the core ideas with no incidental trimmings. This gives three big advantages: . Wireframes are easy to create and edit. A change that takes a company a week to implement on a live website may take ten seconds to make on a wireframe. . | Wireframes are easy to interpret. We once observed a user test of a page that had been designed in high fidelity. “I don’t like the colors,” the user commented. “Ignore the colors,” the designer replied. “I don’t like the cartoon dog,” the user said. “Ignore the dog,” the designer replied. “I don’t like the feel of the page,” the user said. “Ignore the feel,” the designer responded. The user became irritated: “For heaven’s sake, what are you asking me to look at?!” With wireframes, users intuitively understand what you are trying to show them. . | Wireframes help you to focus on what matters: the words. To illustrate this, take one of your pages, select all the text, and paste it into a plain text editor. You may be surprised at what you see. (For many websites, this exercise is much more useful than it may sound.) Some pages are so beautifully designed, it’s easy to overlook the words. But the words are what win A/B tests. . | . Ten years ago, the best way to create wireframes was with paper and Post-its. Some people still prefer to work that way. However, there is now an abundance of good software for doing it. . The following wireframing tools make it easy to display your work-in-progress designs. Some of them allow you to create working prototypes. Many of them allow you to create pixel-perfect final designs. Some even output production-ready code: . The tools we’d recommend you look at first are Sketch, Figma, Balsamiq Mockups, Framer X, and UXPin. However, there are a crazy number of good alternatives, including…taking a very deep breath…Adobe Brackets, AppCooker (for iOS apps), Appery.io (outputs code for mobile and responsive apps), Atomic.io, Axure (a complex, sophisticated wireframe tool suite), Balsamiq Mockups, Canva, Craft, Creately, draw.io, Fireworks, Flinto and Flinto Lite, Fluid (specializes in mobile), Framer (allows you to prototype and code apps for desktop and mobile),…gasping for air…Fuse, Gliffy, Handcraft, HotGloo, Indigo Studio by Infragistics, iPlotz, iRise, Justinmind, Keynote, Koncept App, Lucidchart, Macaw (outputs HTML and CSS), Miro, Mockflow (outputs HTML and CSS), Mockplus, MockingBird, moqups, Naview, NinjaMock, Notism (works with video too), OmniGraffle, Origami Studio, Patternry (for designing style guides),…starting to go blue in the face, gasp…Photoshop Wireframing Kit (templates for commonly used wireframing elements), Pidoco, POP (lets you upload your pen-on-paper prototypes and make them clickable), Principle, Power Mockup (a mockup and wireframe toolkit for PowerPoint), Proto.io, ProtoPie, ProtoShare, ProtoSketch, Prototyp, Prott, Sketch (very popular, a successor to Fireworks),…feeling lightheaded, gasp…templates for paper sketches, UXPin, Visio, Webflow, Wireframe.cc, WireframeSketcher, and Wirify (a wireframing tool that lets you turn any existing website into a wireframe in one click). . The following are tools for people who like to draw by hand: Apple Pencil for iPad Pro, iskn, livescribe pens, Paper and Pencil by 53, and Penultimate. . 6. Use design-feedback tools (to make it easier to test your designs) . Design-feedback tools like Verify, five-second test, and PickFu allow you to get quick feedback on what you’ve created. . Here’s how they work. You upload your designs or ideas, and then ask the panel for feedback in a variety of formats: . Five-second test: The user is shown your design for five seconds. They then answer questions that you set them, like “What do you remember seeing?” . | First-click analysis: You set the users a task, and then see where they click first. The aggregated clicks are displayed as a heat map. . | Question test: You ask the users questions about your design. . | Multiclick test: You link several pages together and then set the users a task. The software records how the users navigate your website. . | Annotation test: You ask the users a question&mdash;for example, “What do you like and dislike about this design?”&mdash;and then ask them to annotate their feedback onto your design. . | Preference test: You upload two designs&mdash;two headlines, for example&mdash;and ask users which they prefer. Preference tests force the users to choose from two alternatives. They can provide insights that would take years with A/B testing. You just have to bear in mind that the insights are based on the users’ opinions, which possibly may not correspond to their actions. . | . All of which can provide invaluable insights. . Regardless of how your designs were created, InVision and Marvel allow you to easily turn them into functional prototype websites. With InVision, you upload your page designs, and then link them together to make the website navigable. Then, you can carry out user tests on what, to the users, appears to be a real website, even though it hasn’t seen a smidgen of code. . InVision also allows other people to give written feedback on your work-in-progress designs. You upload your designs, and then invite others to annotate them with whatever type of feedback you desire. Notable has similar functionality. Alternatives include Firefly and BugHerd. The Composite app connects to Photoshop files, turning them into clickable prototypes. . To gather feedback on your work-in-progress videos, you can use Frame.io, a fantastic web-based platform. Alternatives include Wipster, Symu, Vidhub, and Kollaborate. Such services provide great benefits; it’s hard to gather and record such feedback even when everyone’s in the same room. . Optimal Workshop provides several tools (OptimalSort, Treejack, and Chalkmark) to help you optimize your website’s navigation and information architecture. The tools are described in our article about card sorting. Alternatives for card sorting include SimpleCardSort, UsabiliTEST, and Xsort. . Usability underpins all of conversion . Almost every win has great usability woven into it&mdash;just like most successful books have “good grammar” in them. Usability underpins all of conversion. . Along with readability, usability is a life skill that’s worth developing. The world has no shortage of things that are infuriatingly confusing to use. . If you can make things easy to use, the world will love you. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-51&quot;&gt; Winning websites…give people what they want: here’s what to do if your website doesn’t satisfy your visitors’ needs . For over ten years, we have been urging companies to dominate their markets. In fact, that’s one of the main things that we help our clients to do. Many of them are now leaders in their verticals. In this chapter, we describe a powerful growth strategy that’s hidden in plain sight. It’s used by many of the web’s most successful companies, it’s ridiculously effective for dominating an industry, and yet many companies overlook it. . It’s based around a major conversion killer: lack of interest. . Here’s what we mean by “lack of interest”: . Visitors to your website can’t find what they want. . | Maybe because you don’t even offer it. . | So they leave. . | . What can you do about that? Should you do anything about that? . In this chapter, we hope to persuade you that it’s imperative that you do something about it. And then we go on to describe a step-by-step process for implementing this strategy&mdash;a strategy by which many companies wipe out their competitors. . “Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.” &mdash;Peter Thiel, venture capitalist and cofounder of PayPal . How superstores&mdash;and leading e-commerce stores&mdash;use this principle to gain a formidable advantage . It’s crucial that your company becomes the dominant player in its industry, by satisfying as many of your visitors’ intentions as possible. If it doesn’t, another business will take that space, capture those economies of scale, and push your company out. . Most superstores sell a huge number of products. If a visitor wants bananas then, yes, the superstore has bananas. If a visitor wants pet insurance then, yes, the superstore sells that too. And if a visitor wants children’s T-shirts then, yes, it sells those too. By satisfying all of the visitors’ intentions and desires, the store mops up more of the money that the visitors are willing to spend. . The preceding approach has a huge impact. If you can satisfy twice as many of your visitors’ intentions, you effectively halve the cost of acquiring a customer. (Because the cost of acquisition gets divided over twice as many purchases.) Plus, if a visitor can get everything they want from you, they are less likely to visit one of your competitors. . For contrast, let’s consider an imaginary company that couldn’t easily adopt the above strategy. Let’s call it “One Trick Squirrel.” One Trick Squirrel makes nothing but smooth peanut butter. It doesn’t even make the type with bits in. (It disposes of the bits in a landfill site.) One Trick Squirrel Peanut Butter could be the best in the world, but a One Trick Squirrel store could never be large, because it satisfies only one need&mdash;and few people want all of their weekly groceries to be peanut butter. . There’s a limit to how large a store can become if it doesn’t satisfy many visitors’ intentions. Amazon began to do this early, presumably because many of its senior team members were from the retail industry, so they understood this economic imperative. So if you visit Amazon.com and search for a book called Soils of Outer Mongolia, you will find what you need. . Amazon created Amazon Marketplace to ensure that whatever a visitor wants, Amazon can provide (even if it’s via a marketplace seller). Amazon understands the importance of giving visitors whatever they want. It’s good for financial reasons, but it’s also great for the visitor experience. And it means that Amazon is often the first place that Amazon’s customers look&mdash;to the extent that some people forget that there are alternatives. Amazon is now nicknamed “The Everything Store”&mdash;and that was by strategy, not by chance. . How to do gap analysis for visitor intentions: a practical process that can generate breakthrough results . We use the following process to identify&mdash;and quantify&mdash;the opportunities for satisfying a website’s visitor intentions. Begin by using an on-page survey to ask your visitors why they visited your website: . . An on-page survey to identify your visitors’ intentions. . Wait till you have collected at least a hundred responses. Then create a table with the following columns: . . Table headings for gap analysis of visitor intentions. . Populate them like this: . Column 1: Your visitors’ intentions. In this column, list all the responses to the question “What did you come to our website to do?” Of course, no two responses are the same, so you’ll need to group all the responses that had similar meanings. (For example, if one response was “Buy pet insurance” and another was “To see if I should get pet insurance,” you might want to categorize them both as “Pet insurance.”) . | Column 2: Percentage of all visits (%). Enter the percentage of visitors who gave each response. . | Column 3: Do we satisfy this intention? Enter a yes or a no, depending on whether this is a visitor intention that your website satisfies. For the example above, if you did sell pet insurance, you’d write “Yes.” If you didn’t, you’d write “No.” . | . Column 3 may reveal that you satisfy only a small percentage of your visitors’ needs. Many companies accept this as inevitable. If the visitor wants pet insurance, and the website doesn’t offer pet insurance, the company dismisses the visitor as having been unqualified. . . You may find that you satisfy only a small percentage of your visitors’ needs. . However, the opportunity comes when you populate the following two columns: . Column 4: How do we currently monetize this intention? How could we monetize this intention? . | Column 5: How much revenue do we currently generate from this? How much revenue could we generate from this? . | . Columns 4 and 5 allow you to estimate the opportunity cost, revealing how you could increase your profit per visitor. For new products, you will have to estimate the value for Column 5. You can base your estimates on knowledge of your competitors’ sales; information from suppliers; sales figures from a trial run; or calculations based on the survey responses, making assumptions about conversion rates. . Why is it so important to increase the profit per visitor? Because for many websites, the key metric is the acceptable cost per acquisition, which is how much you can afford to spend on acquiring each visitor. And that figure depends on how much profit you can generate from each visitor. So… . if you can increase your profit-per-visitor, . | you can afford to spend more per visitor, . | and thus outbid your competitors on ads, . | which means you get the lion’s share of the traffic. . | . Of course, conversely, if your competitors can monetize your visitors better than you can, then there’s a good chance they can do the same to you. . (It might sound mercenary to talk about “monetizing visitors.” However, from a visitor’s-eye view, monetization tends to be a good thing; as a consumer, you’ll find that there’s a large correlation between the companies you like and the ones you give money to.) . How to populate Column 4&mdash;an easy way to generate ideas for monetizing visitor intentions . The following methods may help you identify products and services that would satisfy your visitors’ intentions: . Method 1: Temporarily add a Google AdSense box to the page. AdSense is powered by auction bidding, so the ads that are shown will be those that the advertisers (and Google) are confident will persuade your visitors to spend money. Once the ads are live on your website, study which products and services they promote. . | Method 2: Look at which products and services your competitors offer&mdash;particularly those that they push hard. . | Method 3: Identify companies that have similar economics to yours, and look at which products they cross-sell. Perhaps your company sells a B2B commodity, like safety signage. If so, look for other companies that sell B2B commodities, and see what other products and services they offer. You may be inspired to discover that the domain registrar GoDaddy cross-sells office productivity software. Or that the printing company Vistaprint cross-sells an email-marketing service. Not only will this reveal products you should be cross-selling, but you may also discover that the similar companies (like GoDaddy)&mdash;or even the cross-sold companies (like the office software)&mdash;should be cross-selling your products. . | . An easy, risk-free way to add products and services . If your research reveals that you should be selling pet insurance, you don’t need to set up an insurance company overnight. The following process allows you to explore tentatively how you could offer a new product range. The steps are listed in terms of increasing risk and commitment: . Continue running ads on your page: If the ads are generating significant revenues, you could continue to run them. Some of our clients make a significant fraction of their revenue from displaying ads. . | Continue advertising other companies’ products, but bypass the ad network: Contact companies that are advertising on your page, and do deals with them directly. They can pay you on a cost-per-impression basis, or on a performance basis with a cost-per-acquisition deal or a cost-per-lead deal. . | If you believe that it would be strategically wise, you may choose to handle more of the value chain in-house&mdash;by stopping the ads and instead designing, manufacturing, or providing a similar product or service yourself. . | . An example of creating additional product ranges . While studying Morphsuits’ analytics, we noticed that many visitors were searching for a type of Halloween suit that didn’t exist. Armed with the data, Morphsuits started manufacturing the new type of suit, safe in the knowledge that there was zero risk in creating it. The new suit became a top seller. We weren’t surprised. We even knew approximately how many it would sell. . The Morphsuits team is extremely dynamic and has taken this principle far. Over the past few years, they have rebranded into MorphCostumes and increased their number of suits from 71 to over 300. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-53&quot;&gt; Winning websites…make the benefits clear: if your visitors aren’t persuaded of the benefits, here’s what to do . Even if your visitors can understand your writing…even if they can use your website…and even if you offer what they came for…they may not understand&mdash;or like&mdash;your value proposition. . In this chapter, we describe how to increase your conversion rate by fixing three of the most common problems with value propositions. . What is a value proposition? . Your value proposition can be defined as the benefits of your product or service minus its costs. . Value Proposition = Benefits − Costs . The costs aren’t limited to the financials; they also include economic risk and the cost of time and resources. . A more buyer-centric definition of value proposition . The previous definition can be a bit too seller-centric. To aid clear thinking, we also find it useful to think of a value proposition as perceived through the eyes of an individual buyer. This view reflects more accurately what happens when a purchase is made: . The decision is made in the mind of the buyer. . | The value of each feature will be different for each buyer. For example, some car buyers will find value in an ashtray; others won’t. Either way, it’s clear that the “value” being discussed is the value to each buyer. Thus, in the customer’s-eye definition, the value proposition is different for each buyer. . | Buyers’ reasoning tends to be in terms of pros and cons, not benefits and costs&mdash;just listen to your own reasoning next time you buy something. If you create mental “pros and cons” lists and not “benefits and costs” lists, then it seems a shame to switch to the benefits-and-costs view when you’re being a marketer, thus abandoning your lifetime of intuition. . | . Value Proposition = Pros − Cons . We find it useful to view a value proposition both ways&mdash;through the seller’s eyes and the buyer’s eyes&mdash;as two sides of the same coin. . Let’s start by focusing on the pros: . Four ways companies fail to communicate their benefits (the pros)&mdash;and several ways to fix the problems. . 1. It’s a myth that you should always talk in terms of benefits and not features . Some marketing experts say that all sales copy should be expressed not in terms of features (a product’s properties) but in terms of benefits (how the product helps the user). This isn’t true. You should sometimes state the features, sometimes state the benefits, and often state both. . The “benefits, not features” advice was aimed at beginner copywriters, who often write only in terms of features. Features usually aren’t enough. When buyers read features, they often think, “So what?” They don’t understand how the features will help. . If, as a buyer, you discover that a particular eBook reader has the feature of cellular connectivity, you may think “So what? How would that be useful?” So you may appreciate an explanation of the benefits of cellular connectivity&mdash;that it allows you to buy and instantly download books from anywhere in the world. If you finish your book while you’re lying on the beach on vacation, you can instantly choose and start a new one. . Sometimes, even obvious benefits are worth stating. You might understand that a flight will take you to a sunny Italian resort, but an explicit mention of that benefit will still psychologically take you there. It activates those neurons. . However, there are times when you shouldn’t explicitly mention benefits. One of them is when the benefit is taboo. A charity website shouldn’t explicitly say, “Donate today and you can show off to your friends.” Another is when the benefit is so obvious&mdash;or unimpressive&mdash;as to be a waste of words, and possibly patronizing. On a car manufacturer’s website, it’s probably worth mentioning that a car has a maximum speed of 120&nbsp;mph, but it wouldn’t be worth explaining the benefits of that. . The second half of “mention benefits and not features” is clearly nonsense. You should usually state features. Imagine a laptop manufacturer’s website that says, “Lets you store loads of files” but then refuses to state the size of the hard drive. Benefits alone can leave the reader thinking, “Yeah, right.” Benefits usually need proof to support them, and features are among the most compelling forms of proof. It’s not enough to hear that a car is “really, really safe.” You want to know it has air bags. . So when shouldn’t you mention features? You should omit them when the benefit is not in doubt&mdash;or when there is little space and the benefit is better supported by a different type of proof. With fitness videos, for example, customers are much more persuaded by celebrity endorsements and by testimonials from other successful customers than they are by what’s in the video itself. . You become more effective at CRO when you ignore rules like “Technique X is good; Technique Y is bad” and instead understand each technique’s function. Now that you understand the function of features and benefits, you’ll be able to spot when to state a feature, when to state a benefit, and when to state both. Remember, if you describe a feature and the readers are saying, “So what?” describe the benefit. If you describe a benefit and the readers are saying, “Yeah, right,” describe the feature (or another type of proof). . 2. Many companies don’t make it clear what their products or services do . Some products or services&mdash;particularly those that are complex&mdash;can be hard to describe. When such products are sold using a traditional brand-marketing approach, the results are often disastrous. The visitors don’t buy because they don’t understand what they’ll get. . For example: . Unclear branding waffle: “Music, Meet Home.” . | Copy that wins: “The world’s leading speaker system: Play any song in any room from any phone.” . | . Another example: . Unclear branding waffle: “Introducing the oases of freshness: The Aquaris, the Tritona, the Anapos.” . | Copy that wins: “Choose your water filter jug: a slim one for the fridge, a large one for the table, or a watertight one for on the go.” . | . Let’s have one more: . Unclear branding waffle: “Express yourself. Impress yourself.” . | Copy that wins: “The ultimate suite of cloud-based tools for all your marketing communications.” . | . You get the idea. . If you are asked to improve the website of a technical product that is currently being sold with a brand-marketing approach, here’s a useful tip: see if the product has a Wikipedia page. The Wikipedia page is likely to contain valuable plain-language descriptions that are absent from the manufacturer’s landing page. Plain language almost always beats branding waffle. . Many marketers aren’t aware that their website has this problem. The problem goes beneath the radar because visitors seldom report that they are “struggling to understand the value proposition.” Instead, they say things like “I’m still researching.” Also, most unclear descriptions aren’t as obviously bad as the ones above. The best way to identify unclear benefits is through user testing. During user tests, listen for clues that the users haven’t understood the product or service. For example, you may find that a user’s objections to buying don’t make sense. Or that the user has gone quiet. . Unclear product descriptions are guaranteed to kill conversions. So whenever we spot them, we know that a big win is just around the corner. Clarifying the benefits of complex, hard-to-explain products has led to many of our biggest wins. . 3. Some companies forget to mention some valuable benefits . The travel-phone company Mobal gave away a high-quality travel adapter with every phone. But it forgot to mention the travel adapter anywhere on its website. When we added the travel adapter to the website, sales increased. So we added it to the offline marketing campaigns too. This was one of the many contributing factors that allowed us to triple Mobal’s sales in one year. . We used this technique to great effect when we created more than $1 million of additional sales for Moz. In a case study on our website, we describe how we added to Moz’s landing page many features that previously went unmentioned. . To ensure that you aren’t making this mistake, list all of the elements of value that your visitors get, and then check that your website communicates them all clearly. It can help to order the product yourself, so you see the whole package with your own eyes. Also, ask your customers why they bought, and then ensure that all of their reasons are featured in your marketing materials with appropriate prominence. . 4. Many companies don’t make it clear what happens once the visitor says yes . Many websites&mdash;particularly those that sell services&mdash;don’t help their visitors to envisage the postorder experience. There are many ways of overcoming this problem. The following method, common in Japan, is rarely seen in the Western world. Japanese consumers expect to be shown what they are going to get. All Japanese restaurants, for example, have plastic food in their windows, showing what each meal looks like. . Similarly, many Japanese companies display cartoon flow charts that show what will happen once a visitor orders the product or service. We created the following flow chart for Mobal, to show Mobal’s Japanese customers what to expect once they had ordered a travel phone. . . A future-pacing flow chart for a travel-phone service. . The flow chart makes it clear how the process works: the order is placed, the phone is delivered, the phone is charged, the person flies abroad, calls are made, Mobal sends an itemized bill, the person returns home, and then the whole process is repeated for subsequent trips. The cartoon was so effective on the Japanese website, we transferred it to Mobal’s USA website, to similar success. . Such flow charts are an example of what the hypnotism world calls future pacing: The buyer is told what they are going to experience over the next few days, weeks, or months. (This is closely related to the sales technique of making the prospect “think beyond the sale.”) Even though future-pacing diagrams are less common in the West, they are extremely effective everywhere, for the following reasons: . They answer the questions that the visitors are asking: “If I order this product or service, what will happen next? What will be the process I follow?” . | They allow the visitors to rehearse mentally the process of using the service, visualizing it as being part of their lives. . | . So if your product or service has an unclear postsale experience, then a future-pacing flow chart may help to increase your sales. We frequently get wins by adding them. . Future-pacing videos and how to create them . Once you have created a future-pacing diagram, you may find that it would benefit from being turned into a video. If so, remember that the process of creating a video should be no different from the process of creating a webpage. To begin, create the video in a low-res, highly editable format, which you can test on users&mdash;just as you would do with a webpage wireframe. If your video designer isn’t comfortable carrying out user tests (in our experience, most aren’t), you may prefer to do it yourself, as follows: . Create your storyboard using the animation functionality of PowerPoint or Google Slides. . | If you wish to add a voice-over, record it in ScreenFlow. . | Iteratively test the draft video on users until you are confident that it communicates the message clearly. . | Only then should you get a high-quality version made. . | . This process will ensure that your final video will convert visitors. . The previous techniques provide four opportunities for optimizing your benefits and pros. In the next chapter, we will describe how to optimize the other side of your value propositions: the costs and cons. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-12&quot;&gt; Winning websites…have irresistible offers: if people aren’t persuaded that your deal is great, here’s how to optimize it . . Before you decide upon your pricing, it helps to identify what you’ll monetize&mdash;and how your costs and advantages will be affected by supply-side and demand-side economies of scale. . A surefire way to increase a company’s profit is to optimize its pricing, deals, and offers. Most companies don’t spend as much time as they should on it&mdash;either because they don’t appreciate how fruitful it can be&mdash;or because they find it harder or more boring than other aspects of marketing. Almost all of the strategies described in this chapter are ones we’ve successfully used&mdash;in many cases with increases of over 50%, often much more. . Getting your pricing model wrong can be disastrous&mdash;as this story in The Onion humorously illustrates. (Classmates.com chose to monetize early, and to do so by charging its users&mdash;two activities that are now widely understood to be disastrous for social networks.) . If you want to optimize your pricing, deals, and offers, this chapter contains a huge list of tips, strategies, and things to consider. We have used them on many businesses. Not all of the points will apply to you, but we have found that one breakthrough idea is often enough to transform a business. As you proceed down the list, we recommend you make notes of how you could implement each idea. . Establish your long-term strategy for pricing . Identify your long-term strategy for pricing by considering the following points: . Decide what you’ll monetize . First, decide what you will monetize, and how. (Gillette innovated by making its money from the blades, not the razors. Dollar Shave Club innovated further by selling a recurring subscription.) . If you have economies of scale, penetration pricing often works best . Would your business benefit from economies of scale? (Most web businesses do.) If so, your ideal pricing strategy may be penetration pricing&mdash;charging a low price, basing your financial model on eventually reaching market-dominating economies of scale. . Supply-side economies of scale mean that your profit margins increase the more you sell, because as you sell more, your cost of sales (unit costs) usually becomes lower, and your fixed costs become a smaller fraction of your overall costs. . Demand-side economies of scale mean that the more customers you get, the more value each customer gets from your service, for the following reasons. . You may benefit from having a network of customers. For example, if a phone system had only two users, only one type of call could be made (one between User&nbsp;A and User&nbsp;B). If it had three users, then three types of call could be made (A&ndash;B, B&ndash;C and A-C). If it had twelve users, sixty-six different types of calls could be made. The overall value of a phone system to its users is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users. . | You may benefit from there being a market of complementary products and services. The project-management web app Basecamp has many integrations, which it promotes on its website. At the bottom of the page, Basecamp shows off how quickly it’s acquiring new users, to persuade other companies to add integrations. . | You may benefit from having a bigger knowledge base, more forums, or more trained users. The ecosystem of knowledge around a product can be valuable in itself. WordPress grows because it’s easy to find a WordPress developer and it’s easy for those developers to find answers to their questions. . | You may benefit from the perception that yours is the standard. Users are aware of the value of choosing the ultimate winner&mdash;especially when they have to invest time and resources into using your company&mdash;so they will be attracted by the perception that you’ll win. . | If you don’t have economies of scale, it often helps to price high then decrease prices . Pricing high at first, then lowering prices is good for mopping up all the money available in the marketplace. A book can be launched in hardback only, thus commanding a high price from those who are willing to pay it, and then later it can be released in paperback for mass-market sales. This approach tends to be more effective with products (e.g., consumer electronics) than as a strategy with platforms (e.g., online stores). It also allows statements like “Used to be $XXX” to be used in the future advertising. However, this approach has a weakness: business writer Peter Drucker stated that high prices can effectively “hold an umbrella” over lower-priced competitors, allowing them to thrive. . Increasing prices gets visitors to act promptly . If you communicate that prices will keep increasing, the current prices become scarce. Visitors therefore take action because they know they’ll pay more if they hesitate. This strategy works best when the major challenge is getting visitors to act promptly. . Price your product (or service) to win . Once you have chosen how your pricing will vary as time progresses, you can proceed to your pricing strategy. The following two principles are useful when considering how to price a product. . 1. Consider the gaps in the market . You can identify gaps in the market by asking yourself the following questions: . Which market segment isn’t currently being served? High-end customers? Low-end customers? Enterprise customers? Small businesses? Occasional users? . | To your target market, what represents value? (Gillette, mentioned above, succeeded by being first to acknowledge that no one wants to pay for the razor handle&mdash;they want to pay per shave.) . | What would their “dream product” be? We find it’s useful to ask yourself, “What would definitely work if only we were prepared to do it?” Write it down, even if it’s miles from being possible. Once you know what it is, you may be able to think creatively about how you could offer it. This approach led us to create the highly successful $49 world phone, with no monthly fees, which became a standard in the world phone market. . | . . No product or service exists in a vacuum. To establish your pricing strategy, identify the underserved segments, and then figure out what they value, and what they’d love. . 2. Price high or price low? . For a given type of product or service, pricing low and pricing high each has its advantages. The challenge is to work out where on the continuum your winning strategy lies: . For products that are otherwise clearly identical, low prices tend to lead to high conversion rates (customers/visitors), more repeat purchases (or higher customer retention), high tell-a-friend rates and word-of-mouth, and favorable reviews. . | High prices lead to a higher profit per customer. If you increase your prices and your conversion rate doesn’t fall too much, you may be able to afford to spend more per visitor than your lower-priced competitors. . | . Neither of the above two options is intrinsically better than the other. But bear in mind that, in any market, there can only be one cheapest option&mdash;and that many people don’t want the cheapest option: most people don’t buy the cheapest car available, the cheapest shampoo available, the cheapest clothes available, the cheapest watches available, and the cheapest insurance available. People tend to buy options they perceive to be of higher value. There are many opportunities for selling at high profit margins, provided you can find features and benefits for which customers would be willing to pay a premium. A good mindset is to imagine that you will charge a premium price, and then use your marketing knowhow to justify that price. . Note that many companies take external investment to fund their costs of client acquisition in the short term. The investment gives them all the previously mentioned benefits of high prices and low prices, and is based on the assumption that the strategic benefits of growing quickly will be worth it in the end. . Create irresistible offer sequences . Once you have decided on your pricing strategy, you are ready to start packaging up your offers. Here are some of the many options available to you: . Use an offer that’s known to win . Here’s a great tip: Ask your salespeople what is their most effective offer. Is there anything they can say that always brings in the deal? One of our clients’ top salespeople once told us an offer that almost always worked. We incorporated it into a landing page and presented it to the company’s CEO, who said, “We aren’t able to offer that.” We explained, to his surprise, that his company already did&mdash;and that it worked well. He agreed to let us run the page, and&mdash;to his delight&mdash;it instantly increased the whole company’s sales by over 65%. . Lead with a “no-brainer” . Decide at what point in your offer sequence you monetize your services. The winning strategy is usually to defer gratification, making the initial purchase a “no-brainer,” and then to make money on the subsequent payments: . Make your headline offer irresistibly appealing. . Ensure that the first product that people buy is one of your most liked ones. This will make customers much more likely to return. Survey customers to ensure that you know which of your products are most liked. (Note that your most liked product isn’t necessarily your bestseller.) . | Understand what main criteria your prospects are using to determine value. Set low prices for the criteria people consider when judging value. Supermarkets are very competitive on prices of comparable products, like Heinz Baked Beans, and charge more for products that are less easy to compare, like artisanal balsamic vinegar. . | Make your money on the things people don’t consider when making a decision: Restaurants often have low-priced meals, then make all their money on drinks. . | Consider stripping down the features of your core service, then charging for extras. Car dealers often have low headline rates, then charge for extras. . | . | It can help to make the initial purchase free. If you can’t make it free, then at least try to make the initial price low: . Offer a “free trial,” which may be a no-strings, completely free sample, perhaps with a discount voucher if the customer decides to continue. This works if your service is fantastic, and the best way to persuade buyers is to get them using it. . | Offer a free trial with an ongoing monthly charge if the customer continues. . | If it’s not possible to offer a sample, consider a simulation of a sample. Freebird is a service that allows travelers to get an alternative flight if theirs is canceled. As part of its conversion funnel, Freebird allows users to experience the whole process as a simulation, to see how easy it is. . | Consider offering something small and irresistible for an amazing price, just to get something into the buyer’s shopping cart. Once the buyer has accepted that they’ll be going through the checkout, they are more likely to buy other things. . | Offer an initial discount (e.g., only $9.99/month for the first three months; $19.99/month afterward). . | Multibuy deals: “Buy one, get one free” can be more effective than “half-price,” because it keeps a high price on the product (so doesn’t lower its perceived value) and encourages the customer to buy twice as much. The same goes for other types of multibuy deals. . | State that “We won’t bill you until N days after your purchase.” . | Allow the buyer to pay in installments (e.g., three monthly payments of $9.99). This works well if your research reveals that many buyers don’t currently have the money to pay for the product outright. . | . | Allow the buyer to “return it within X days for your money back.” . | . Add premiums (gifts) and incentives to get a big uplift . You can boost sales by adding gifts and incentives to the core deal: . Information is a great thing to give away as a premium, because it has zero (or almost zero) costs of sale and can have incredibly high perceived value. Think of valuable information that your customers would love to have. For example, a person buying a health supplement to help them sleep may highly desire a report that describes how to get a good night’s sleep. You can deliver the information in a wide range of formats, including audio, video, electronic or printed reports, software, tools, or access to websites. . | If some of your offering involves information, consider how the information can be made to educate the buyers about how to buy your type of product, and how to appreciate the ways in which your product is superior. This works well in B2B sales, because B2B buying is often complex. B2B buyers therefore value “decision-support materials.” A seller of web hosting, for example, could benefit from giving away a guide called “7 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Web Hosting Solution.” . | Consider offering particular premiums only to customers who spend more than a certain amount. One of our favorite techniques is to offer a valuable free report for customers who buy one unit, an additional free report for customers who buy three units, and a further free report for customers who buy five units. A buyer who wants that third report can never get it if they always order one unit at a time. This offer alone can greatly increase the average order value. . | If a customer is paying with someone else’s money (such as their employer’s), consider options that will reward the person personally. Companies that sell to businesses often use rewards such as meals, events, air miles, cash back, and gift vouchers. (Of course, don’t offer anything that’s unethical or illegal.) . | Offer incentives to encourage prospects to behave in a certain way. For example, if you want all the orders to be placed via the web, or via the phone, offer incentives for customers who order via those channels. . | Offer discounted prices if visitors order quickly (e.g., early bird discounts) or in large quantities. . | . Increase the average order value by adding upsells and cross-sells . Upsells (“Would you like that large?”) and cross-sells (“Would you like fries with that?”) can make a great difference to the economics of a sale. Creatively think of other things that the buyer would pay for, such as: . better service; . | better customer support; . | insurance; . | extra information (e.g., a valuable eBook); . | quicker or better service; . | complementary products they’d also like (for inspiration, study the conversion funnels of companies that sell commodities in highly competitive markets like domain names, business cards, and cell phone plans). . | . For inspiration, ask customers (maybe via a survey) what other services they’d like you to offer and what other related services they currently use. In the chapter “Winning websites…give people what they want,” we described a useful workflow for doing this. . Versioning: Hugely increase profits by offering different deals to different people . It helps to offer different deals to different people&mdash;because they have different needs and desires: . The common law of business balance describes consumers’ belief that “you get what you pay for.” So, many customers have a price in mind before they begin shopping, and will pay that price regardless. (A friend of ours went looking for a suit, expecting to pay about $700. He found one that looked good, but it cost just $70. He decided against it, preferring to stick to his plan of finding one that cost more. Imagine how frustrated the store owner would have been to know that not only did she not sell the suit, but that she would have sold it if she had charged ten times as much for it.) . | Create pricing segments for each of your groups of customers. For example, you may choose to have different prices for enterprises, small businesses, and domestic customers. Then, start from the point of view of the customer: begin with the price they’d be prepared to pay, and then work out what the product or service should be at that level. Ensure that each price level contains a “deal maker” or “deal breaker” component that makes it worth it for the buyer to pay the extra amount. . | Create gold, silver and bronze levels of pricing, so you are more likely to have a price point at the amount that a given buyer was thinking of paying. . | Consider a price that’s ten times your current highest price, and then imagine what kind of product or service would justify that price. A company that advises people on getting work permits may usually charge $500 per client. The company might benefit from exploring what a $5,000 service would entail. Who would use it? Even if only a small fraction of buyers took advantage of such an offer, the effect on the economics of the business could be significant. . | Bestow status levels upon your customers: Have different levels of customers, and publicly reward those on the higher levels by giving them a higher status and benefits. People are naturally competitive and aspire to become better customers. This technique is used by every producer of luxury goods. Even credit card issuers manage to charge more for premium gold and platinum cards. . | Offer a loyalty program, whereby the buyers get certain rewards once they have purchased a certain number of units from you. This encourages them to return for more, thus forming a habit, and increasing your lifetime customer value. As every cafe knows, it helps to give customers free loyalty points to begin with, so their reward account has a value from the outset. . | . Test your prices to see which ones win . Testing pricing can be a thorny issue. Some users may contest it. However, changing pricing is one of the most surefire ways of increasing (or decreasing) a company’s profits, so there’s a high value in doing it (and a high cost to getting it wrong&mdash;which is a good reason to A/B test it). . One effective option is to run A/B testing to offer different prices to different users, but then, once they have ordered, to charge them all the lower price, to make it fair. Bear in mind that&mdash;as with all A/B testing&mdash;buyers who use more than one device may see different versions of your pricing. . Another (less scientific) option is to test different prices on different days or weeks. . In both cases, it can be hard to measure the results if your buying cycle is long. But if it’s short, and you sell a lot of units per day, you can gather vital information in a matter of hours. . Increase sales just by optimizing how you describe the offer . Sometimes, you don’t need to change the offer or the value proposition; you just need to change how you describe it. The following techniques work well: . Position yourself as&mdash;and actually be&mdash;the prospects’ trusted advisor, so they know you’re acting in their best interests. This is incredibly important&mdash;be very careful not to squander your integrity for the sake of one quick sale. As Moz’s Rand Fishkin says, the best way to sell something is to not sell anything. Instead, earn the awareness, respect, and trust of those who might buy. . | Make prices look larger by displaying the decimal points (“Free gift&mdash;a $29.00 value”) or lower by hiding them (“Costs only $29”). . | Odd prices work slightly better: $9.99 is perceived as being disproportionately lower than $10.00. This is presumably for the same reason that people get excited when their car odometer clicks over to 10,000 (even though it’s just another mile), and sad when they reach their fortieth birthday (even though they’re only a day older). . | If the price “Was $119, now only $89,” highlight the discount by applying a strikethrough to “Was $119.” . | If something is free&mdash;and the offer sounds too good to be true&mdash;mention that it’s free several times, in different ways. For example: “It’s free, so you pay nothing, no strings attached, no hidden charges, absolutely no cost to you whatsoever.” . | People find it easier to understand fractions than percentages&mdash;so it’s better to say “half-price” or “one-third off” than “50% off” or “33% off.” . | Use apples-to-oranges comparisons to remind people what great value the product is. If you’re selling a training course, compare it to the cost of a college education, highlighting the net benefit by showing students who have gone on to get jobs. If you’re selling a shed, compare it to the cost of having a house extension. If you’re selling a video conferencing solution, compare it with the price of international travel. You can make almost any product sound like a great deal by comparing it to the price of something the buyers are already squandering their money on, like lattes or beer. Which makes you wonder how anyone ever manages to sell lattes or beer. . | Consider expressing the price in a way that makes the numeral less: like changing a monthly rate to a daily rate. . | . Give a reason why you’re making such a great offer . Buyers don’t always want the cheapest option (e.g., a Casio digital watch), but they do want a bargain (e.g., a Rolex Submariner for only $3,000). However, a bargain needs a good rationale. If the deal is great&mdash;as it should be&mdash;explain why, with proof. The following approaches can help: . “Our prices are great because we cut out the intermediaries and sell directly to the consumer.” . | “This is an opening sale.” . | “This price is a special product-launch price.” . | “This is a special offer for new customers.” . | “This is a special offer for existing customers.” . | “This is an end-of-line clearance promotion.” (The offer is about to change, and there’s scarcity.) . | “This promotion is linked to a certain event.” (For example, Christmas, summer, back to school, or Black Friday.) . | . In all cases, give indisputable proof. If the product was previously sold at a higher price, give details (when, where, how much)&mdash;and justify why that price was reasonable. If it’s cheaper or better than competitors’ products, give details, maybe with a comparison chart. . Optimize your payment options . Different customers tend to have different preferred methods of ordering and paying. It’s often best to offer the payment methods they are most comfortable with. Popular options include… . Credit card or debit card . | PayPal, Google Checkout, Amazon Pay or Apple Pay (some iOS users are much more likely to purchase if Apple Pay is supported) . | Direct debit or standing order . | Purchase order . | Credit card over the phone . | 0% finance . | Check . | Cash on delivery (which is popular in some countries) . | . It’s important, too, that you offer the optimal payment schedules. The following options are effective: . Payment in multiple installments works well when the initial price point is high. . | An ongoing monthly fee often beats taking a one-off charge. It represents less initial risk for buyers, and customers pay as they receive value, which can feel more reasonable. . | If your service is charged on a monthly basis, you may choose to specify a minimum term, before which the customer may not cancel. This increases your average order value. However, customers are more likely to buy if the minimum term is, say, 12&nbsp;months than if it’s 24&nbsp;months, so you can increase sales by optimizing the length of the minimum term. . | If your service has a monthly fee, consider also offering a discount for customers who commit to a minimum term and pay in advance. This will be great for your cash flow, and customers are less likely to cancel early. . | . Change the offer, to stay interesting . Ideally, you want to be constantly iterating toward whichever offer is optimal. However, in some industries, it helps to vary things just to stay interesting. . Just ensure that in doing so you’re constantly learning what works. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-56&quot;&gt; Winning websites…are trustworthy: if visitors are wary, here’s how to make your website a powerhouse of credibility and proof . What if your visitors don’t trust you? . Sometimes, visitors don’t proceed because they aren’t persuaded that your company is any good. . This is usually because your website lacks relevant trust signals. There simply isn’t enough proof that the visitors should use you. This chapter describes some highly effective ways to use proof to improve your company’s credibility (and sales). . What kind of proof should you add? There are tens&mdash;maybe hundreds&mdash;of ways to show trust and credibility. Some of them are particularly suited to certain types of businesses, but most businesses benefit from the following: . Size and growth rate . Visitors are greatly influenced by the size and success of companies. For daFlores, Latin America’s largest network of florists, we gained a 44% uplift in sales by highlighting how many Facebook fans the company had. . . We demonstrated the huge size of daFlores by highlighting its army of Facebook fans. . Reviews and testimonials (particularly from authorities and experts) . In one experiment for a software company, we grew sales by over 20% by creating a page that linked to hundreds of customer reviews. (We gathered the reviews by surveying the client’s customers.) The visitors were persuaded by hearing the experiences of people like themselves. . The following image shows how one company took a bold approach by highlighting its worst reviews: . . A bold approach: We know of one e-commerce company that demonstrates its integrity by highlighting its worst reviews. . Data and statistical evidence . Buyers are much more likely to believe your claims if you support them with hard data. . So if you sell cat food, it’s not enough to say that cats like the taste of it. Why would people believe you? A popular cat food brand supported its claim with data: “Eight out of ten owners said their cat prefers it.” . Insurance companies don’t say, “We make it easy to save on car insurance.” They support their claims with data, like: “15 minutes can save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.” . Restaurants that deliver fast food don’t say, “We’ll be there as fast as our bikes can carry us&mdash;we promise.” They say things like “Delivered in 30 minutes&mdash;or it’s free.” . Hand soap manufacturers don’t say that their product “Kills a lot of germs.” They say, “Kills 99.9% of germs.” It sounds much more convincing. . And in its 1962 ad, a particular oil refining company didn’t just say “We supply a lot of oil.” It said, “Each day, we supply enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!” . With hindsight, maybe that last one was misjudged. . Celebrity associations . Celebrity associations can be more effective than you might expect. When selling a diet, for example, many people will be more influenced by a celebrity figurehead than by scientific research. . Over the years, we have paired several of our clients with celebrity figureheads. Most of the celebrities allow their image to be used in return for a fixed fee for a specific duration. In one case, the celebrity was happy to do it for free, because she was a fan of the company. . A word of warning. Before you commit to a deal, though, you may choose to first run an A/B test to measure how the celebrity affects conversions. One of our clients had a celebrity figurehead whose presence actually reduced sales. The client’s branding agency hadn’t carried out A/B tests (we’ve yet to see one that does), and so was oblivious that they had caused such damage. . Demonstrations . Sometimes, the best way to prove something is to demonstrate it: . . A poster showing the space required to transport seventy-two people by either car, bus, or bicycle. The photos demonstrate, better than words ever could, how single-occupancy cars take up a disproportionate amount of road space. (Image credit: Cycling Promotion.) . Social proof . In our case study about how we grew Crazy Egg’s conversion rate by 363%, our winning landing page featured some of Crazy Egg’s prestigious clients. Similarly, when we made over $1 million for Moz, one of our winning pages had a headline that incorporated the names of some of Moz’s prestigious clients. Buyers are reassured when they see that others similar to themselves have already chosen&mdash;and like&mdash;a particular company. . . It can help to mention your most prestigious customers. Readers think, “If it’s good enough for those companies, it’s good enough for me.” . Two industries in which trust is particularly important . Trust is more important in some industries than others. Visitors to financial institutions and health and fitness companies tend to be particularly concerned about trust&mdash;because choosing an unsuitable company could be calamitous: . Health and fitness companies typically benefit from being associated with medical professionals, celebrities, research institutes, and universities. . | Financial institutions tend to benefit from displaying proof of their longevity and size, and from demonstrating flawlessness. . | . “Proof magnets”: A way of bolstering trust and credibility . The world already contains a vast amount of proof of your company’s merits, much of which you probably take for granted. Across the web, there will be a lot of content that would persuade your visitors if only they were to see it. Search for reviews of your company, testimonials, positive PR, etc., and you’ll probably find that only a fraction of this proof ever gets seen by your visitors&mdash;either because it’s not on your website, or because it’s tucked away in the corner of a dusty “About Us” page. . Make sure your visitors see this proof, by incorporating the best of it into your most-visited pages. . We have helped one of our clients, TopCashback, to win the Fast Track 100 award three times in a row. . . TopCashback’s homepage exhibits many types of proof. . TopCashback’s homepage features many types of proof: . Big brands that TopCashback partners with, segmented by category (e.g., fashion, travel, and hotels). . | The tabs at the bottom of the image link to . logos showing authoritative national newspapers and TV programs that TopCashback has been featured in; . | testimonials of members describing the benefits of using TopCashback; . | TopCashback’s TV ad, which is both informative and persuasive (plus, the fact that it’s a national TV ad is itself evidence of credibility); . | the “fun facts” section, which is actually a showcase of compelling evidence that TopCashback is the best at what it does: . “We pay the highest rates: You’ll typically get at least 5% more cashback with us.” . | “If you find a better rate elsewhere we’ll match it.” . | “We were the first cashback site in the world to pass 100% of the cash to our members.” . | “We have the most offers” (with statistical evidence). . | . | . | . Combined, these elements are enough to convince the most skeptical of visitors that TopCashback is trustworthy and authoritative. . Taking it a step further: Proof investment . Beyond proof magnets lies proof investment. Once you understand what would persuade your visitors, then you should spend time, money, and ingenuity acquiring those things. For example… . If your visitors would be most persuaded by . an association with a Hollywood celebrity…then invest in acquiring that; . | rave reviews from experts…then work to gain them; . | your rapid growth or huge size…then set that as a goal; . | awards…then aim to win awards. . | . | . This illustrates an important point: conversion is not an afterthought. Conversion is identifying what type of company your visitors would ideally love to do business with…and then becoming that company. This approach goes to the core of your business. It means that your customer research determines the direction in which your company grows. . As it should. . Hence, the company’s product strategy and marketing strategy should be led by its conversion team. . What if visitors trust your company but not your product? . Just because visitors trust your website doesn’t mean they have found a product that they trust. A visitor may be happy to use your online pharmacy, but they still need to be persuaded of the efficacy of a particular drug. . A visitor may lack trust for several reasons: . The product isn’t good. . | The product isn’t described well enough. . | The product isn’t the best choice for the visitor&mdash;perhaps because the search functionality or navigation has done a bad job. . | . In such cases, your job is to persuade the visitor of the merits of the product, but not at the expense of eroding their trust in your company. Leading e-commerce companies are great at this. They retain their trusted-advisor status by including impartial customer reviews. . The same types of proof that were effective for building trust in your company are equally effective at building trust in a product. Just be aware that “lack of trust in your company” and “lack of trust in the product” are two separate problems. Both must be solved before a customer will place an order. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-17&quot;&gt; Winning websites…remove risk: how to use guarantees to remove visitors’ fear of commitment . A guarantee can be powerful, like a chainsaw. . Used right, it can cut through customer objections. . Used wrong, it can cut through profits. . In this chapter, we’ll describe how to know if a guarantee would work for your business&mdash;and how to design and implement a guarantee that works. . When (and why) do guarantees work? . Guarantees don’t always increase sales. To understand when a guarantee would help, consider the two major functions of a guarantee: . Function 1: A guarantee reduces the risk for the customer. If the company doesn’t fulfill the guarantee’s promise, the customer is compensated. . Function 2: A good guarantee self-evidently promises that your business will be harmed if you don’t honor your claims. It effectively says, “Our promise must be true. Otherwise we wouldn’t be in business.” It thus acts as a kind of proof. . Many people underestimate the importance of Function 2. . So, guarantees are effective when… . the visitors want what the company is promising, . | but they are nervous about the risk, or are skeptical about the claims, . | and your service lives up to its claims. . | . In such cases, the new guarantee can have amazing results. Just by adding and perfecting a guarantee, we boosted one of our client’s sales by almost 50%. . A guarantee would not be effective for a hot dog cart, though. Because visitors aren’t nervous about wasting a few dollars on a hot dog. And hot dog carts don’t make claims that make visitors skeptical. . However, if a hot dog cart were to claim to sell “the best hot dog you’ve ever tasted,” then a guarantee would help to overcome the prospects’ natural skepticism. And if the cart were to increase the price of its hot dogs to $10, a guarantee (such as “$10 for the best hot dog you have ever tasted&mdash;or it’s free”) would help to reduce customers’ risk, and therefore increase the sales. . Ingredients of a highly effective guarantee . A great guarantee contains the following ingredients: . It should guarantee that the customer will get the benefits they desire. (In fact, you may consider charging in terms of the benefit&mdash;like razor blade manufacturers make their money on the blades, not the handle.) And it should address the main risks about which the buyer is tentative. If the buyer is worried about whether the product will achieve a particular result, offer a performance guarantee. If the buyer is worried whether they’ll be happy, offer a satisfaction guarantee. If the buyer is worried about whether the price is good enough, offer a price-match guarantee. A guarantee will be effective only if it addresses an existing concern. . | It should offset the risk&mdash;and ideally neutralize it&mdash;so, if things go wrong, the buyer will be compensated for their time, effort, and cost. . | It should have a name, indicating that it’s a tangible thing. For example, “Our 100% Money-Back Guarantee” or “Lifetime Guarantee.” The name makes a good headline. . | The best guarantees are worded positively. They don’t say, “If you dislike our service…”; they say, “We guarantee that you’ll love our service.” The most common mistake with guarantees is to word the guarantee negatively&mdash;as a “get-out clause”&mdash;rather than in positive terms, as a promise. When you bring up the subject of returns, use a phrase like “In the unlikely event that…” . | Explain why you can afford to make the guarantee&mdash;because you aren’t really taking a risk; most customers are delighted. . | Sometimes it helps to put the guarantee in the voice of the company’s chief spokesperson. . | Consider giving the guarantee a long claim period. A guarantee with a deadline is effectively a time-limited offer. The buyer has a certain number of days to make a decision. If your guarantee’s claim period is short&mdash;fourteen days, for example&mdash;the principle of urgency will be strongly working against you. On the other hand, increasing your claim period from twelve months to twenty-four months doubles your financial risk with possibly no incremental increase in conversion rate. The optimal period depends on many factors, including your cost of sales, the quality of the product, the time a customer perceives they will need to evaluate the product, the typical lifetime of the product, and the impracticality of returning the product. To identify the optimal duration, we find it useful to use financial scenario modeling supported by A/B testing data. . | At the point of sale, it should be evident that your guarantee is easy to invoke. . | Emphasize that no strings are attached. In particular, customers often worry that the guarantee will be nullified if they use the product&mdash;or even take it out of the box&mdash;so emphasize that they are encouraged to use it. . | Promise you’ll give a prompt refund. Customers worry that it may take a long time to get the money back. . | The guarantee should be featured at all the points where the buyer is thinking of the risk. That’s usually near the call to action. Sometimes, it’s up front, too. You may also choose to mention it when they abandon. . | A nine-step checklist for implementing a guarantee safely . Is your company hesitant to offer a bold guarantee? That’s understandable. A guarantee can do harm if it’s implemented badly. Also, with guarantees the feedback loop is long, because you can’t calculate the costs of invoked guarantees until after the guarantee period has expired. . The following workflow provides a low-risk way to implement a bold guarantee: . Create the guarantee, based on the principles described previously. . | Carry out scenario modeling, as follows: Create a table in which the columns represent different values of “uplift in conversion,” and the rows represent different values of “percentage of customers who invoke the guarantee.” Then work out the net change in profit for each combination. Also consider how guarantee claims would be handled operationally (accepting returns, restocking shelves, issuing refunds, etc.). If you are satisfied that the guarantee will generate additional profits, then proceed to the next step. . | Run the guarantee as an A/B test for a short time&mdash;for just a few days, if that’s all the risk you can bear. . | Wait for the guarantee period to expire. . | Calculate the increase in profits, based on the measured uplift in sales. . | Calculate the cost of people invoking the guarantee. In our experience, the invocation rate tends to be lower than companies expect, sometimes by an order of magnitude. . | If you need more data (which you probably will), return to Step 3 and run the guarantee for longer. By doing this in small increments, you remove the risk caused by the long feedback loop. . | If you do have enough data, and the increase in profit more than offsets the cost of returns, make the guarantee permanent. . | Return to Step 1, creating a bolder guarantee. . | The most fruitful activities regarding guarantees . We’ve had wins from many types of guarantees: price-match guarantees, satisfaction guarantees, payment-deferral guarantees&mdash;even good-weather guarantees. The wins typically come from three activities: . Creating a guarantee for a company that doesn’t already offer one; . | Improving the wording of a guarantee (some guarantees should be compact, and some should be long); . | Placing the guarantee at the right point in the conversion flow. . | If risk is a factor for your visitors, then those three activities are likely to be effective for you. . The boldest guarantee we have tested . We tested a particularly bold guarantee for the travel phone company Mobal. Previously, using financial modeling, we had correctly identified that Mobal could make huge profits by selling each phone at a subsidized price, and then making all of its money from subsequent call charges. So each time we sold a phone, we made a significant short-term loss. Offering a guarantee on such an offer might have sounded reckless. . Because the stakes were so high, we carried out a scenario analysis. It forecast that a guarantee would be likely to increase the overall profits, even taking into account the costs of servicing the guarantee. (This is where it helps to have a PhD scientist on your team.) . Fortunately, our modeling paid off. We tested a sixty-day satisfaction guarantee&mdash;which was even longer than the average customer’s trip. The conversion rate rose, and the return rate turned out to be much lower than our safeguards had allowed for&mdash;so the guarantee was a huge success. Before long, the conversion rate was so high, Mobal was able to invest profitably up to a quarter of a million dollars per month in offline advertising, and the sales tripled within twelve months to $9.1 million. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-52&quot;&gt; Winning websites…are like water chutes: if your website doesn’t appeal to both early- and late-stage buyers, here’s how to design unbeatable multistep funnels . It’s easy to forget that some visitors aren’t ready to buy . You hear marketers say that they “want to make visitors reach for their credit cards.” But pushy selling is usually thrashed by sophisticated relationship building. . In this chapter, we explain why you need to develop a multistep marketing funnel that converts even those visitors who are “just browsing.” Then, we present the CRE Funnel Planner, a framework that makes it easy to design such funnels. . What we can learn from bricks-and-mortar bookstores . About twenty-five years ago, offline bookstores learned not to push the hard sale. They discovered they could convert a visitor from “just browsing” to “buying” by making their stores highly conducive to reading. They added chairs, reading areas, and even in-store coffee stores. They discovered that the more time visitors spent in the store, the more likely they were to buy. . Amazon has adopted the same approach, allowing visitors to “look inside” books. . The Hazelnut Trail&mdash;a mental model that helps you to design amazing conversion funnels . Imagine that you lost your beloved pet squirrel after letting him off the leash during a walk in a nearby forest. How would you coax him back home to his room? One effective approach (according to the animal advisors we hired for this convoluted analogy) would be to leave a trail of hazelnuts from the forest all the way back to the house. . If you simply left all the hazelnuts in a large pile back at home, then your squirrel wouldn’t make the journey. The plan would work only if you left a trail of evenly spaced, irresistibly high quality hazelnuts from where the squirrel was last seen to where you wanted him to be. . The Hazelnut Trail is a useful analogy for an effective marketing funnel. Like squirrels, people tend to act based on rewards, especially short-term rewards. In his book The Hidden Tools of Comedy (which we love), Steve Kaplan says, . “Everything we do, we do with the hopeful (at times deluded) idea that it will improve our lives. Everything we’re wearing today, every choice we’ve made, we made because we thought it would, even infinitesimally, make things better for us.” . Your conversion funnel should be like a Hazelnut Trail. Your visitors must be irresistibly attracted by each step of your sales funnel. They must believe that every step will make their lives at least slightly better. . The Conversion Rate Experts (CRE) Funnel Planner makes it easy to plan your Hazelnut Trail . All of the previous advice is easier said than done. The CRE Funnel Planner provides a valuable framework. It helps to turn your one-step sales process into a much more sophisticated, more profitable multistep process. It also makes it easier to communicate your funnel to your colleagues. . The planner has the following three columns: . . The CRE Funnel Planner: Much more powerful than you’d guess from those three simple columns. . A (terrible) one-step funnel for a seller of fishing boats . Now, let’s populate the CRE Funnel Planner for InflataFish, an imaginary company that sells inflatable fishing boats. Badly. . . A CRE Funnel Planner for an imaginary seller of inflatable fishing boats. . InflataFish has a crude one-step sales process: . The visitors want to look at inflatable fishing boats, maybe to buy one but at the moment just to look. . | InflataFish wants to get the visitors to click on the “Buy Now” button or order by phone, then pay. . | So InflataFish has overzealously reached for the visitors’ credit cards. It has created a sales page (represented by the hazelnut-shaped bullet point) that describes the boat and its features, advantages, and benefits. InflataFish hopes that the visitors will click “Buy Now” and spend $2,000 on a boat. . | . It’s equivalent to going to a nightclub and asking a stranger to marry you. . A (good) multipart funnel for a seller of fishing boats . InflataFish would benefit from creating a multistep Hazelnut Trail, as follows: . . A much-improved Hazelnut Trail for the same company. . In this case, the left-hand column is still the same&mdash;the visitor just wants to look at inflatable fishing boats. And, as before, InflataFish ultimately wants the visitor to click the “Buy Now” button. . But now, InflataFish has set itself many intermediate goals, each of which offers an appealing hazelnut reward: . First, InflataFish wants to become the visitors’ trusted advisor. It could do this by providing valuable free reports that explain how to buy inflatable fishing boats. And it could provide useful product-selection tools. Both of those are high-quality hazelnuts. . | Then, it wants to integrate the visitors into its community. It could do this by providing a forum in which its visitors could share fishing advice and experiences. That’s another high-quality hazelnut. . | Then it wants to collect the visitors’ email addresses. Which it does by providing three compelling offers (hazelnuts), including . a valuable free report called “How to plan the ultimate fishing trip&mdash;100 great tips from our customers.” . | a free, useful DVD about buying and using fishing boats. . | a useful email course delivered daily called “Angling Alerts: The latest news for fishing enthusiasts.” . | . | . Then InflataFish wants the visitors to click on the “Buy Now” button and pay for a boat. The visitors will do this when they are ready. But only because over a period of hours, days, weeks, months, or even years, they have gradually moved through the Hazelnut Trail, always to the point that matches their level of comfort, desire, and readiness. . It’s naively optimistic to hope that all visitors will go along the whole trail in one step. Business relationships&mdash;like personal relationships&mdash;take time to build. . “Readiness”&mdash;an important concept to understand . The word readiness is important when it comes to conversion funnels. Many marketers forget that, to a large extent, buyers will buy only when they are ready: . Sometimes people become ready because of something that has happened. For example, . A cell-phone contract expires, so a person becomes free to choose another carrier. . | On deciding to move house, a person starts to look for a moving company. . | After eating too much over the holidays, a person decides to join a weight-loss program. . | . | Sometimes people become ready to buy only once they have started a project. For example, people tend to plan a vacation on a day of their choosing, not when they see an ad for travel insurance. As soon as they decide to start planning, they begin a flurry of buying flights, hotels, car hire, etc. . | . How to manage readiness . It can be prohibitively expensive to persuade visitors to buy when they aren’t ready. It’s economically preferable to accept that buyers will buy when they are ready. . There are two ways in which a travel company can get a person’s attention when they are ready: . Appear in the prospect’s mind at the right time. By building a relationship with a prospect, a company can be the first thought that pops into a prospect’s mind when they become ready. . | Appear somewhere in the buying process. For example, a company that sells travel insurance could ensure that its marketing materials appear within the marketing funnels of other travel companies (such as hotels, airlines, travel insurance, airport transport, etc.). . | A sophisticated Hazelnut Trail worth $125m . To see an excellent example of a Hazelnut Trail, visit MoneySavingExpert.com, which is a UK-based financial services company. Its website is extremely popular, getting 13 million unique visitors a month. In fact, one in six UK citizens has opted in to its email list. In 2012, it sold for £87 million (about $125 million). . It’s not even obvious that the website is a commercial venture. On arriving at the website, you’ll be invited to subscribe to the free money-saving email. Then, you’ll be shown the valuable best-buy guides that explain, in plain language, how to buy different types of financial service. Then, you’ll be introduced to the money-saving forum and many other useful tools. . The website’s Hazelnut Trail is so effective you don’t even feel like you’re dealing with a company. By the time that you sign up for a financial product, you probably won’t even feel like you have been sold to. The fact that the company gets paid at the end seems almost incidental. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-59&quot;&gt; Winning websites…manage complexity: can your visitors not see the wood for the trees? Here’s an eight-step approach to managing complex sales . When we ask a website’s visitors why they didn’t buy, we hear them say the same things over and over again. Lack of trust comes up a lot, as does lack of understanding and inability to find a suitable product. . However, some objections aren’t widespread&mdash;they are product-specific. For example, there might be a hundred reasons why a buyer isn’t ready to buy customer-relationship-management (CRM) software, and each of the reasons is specific to CRM software. Each objection has to be tackled individually. What can you do if your visitors have tens&mdash;or even hundreds&mdash;of different objections? . This is where conversion gets hard. For a marketer who was hoping just to add a few testimonials and a guarantee, the problem can seem overwhelming. It can only be solved by a combination of process, diligence, and skill. And the following steps: . Step 1: A simple template to manage visitors’ objections (and your counterobjections) . Step 2: Should you use long or short copy? (Try to reduce how many words you need, by reducing the commitment. And then use as many words as you need.) . Step 3: How to organize your persuasive copy using “separation of concerns” . Step 4: Make it clear where one module ends and the next begins . Step 5: Optimize your navigation . Step 6: Two ways to improve how you label modules . Step 7: How to use “progressive disclosure” to stop your visitors getting lost in the detail (and then abandoning) . Step 8: Fallback options to convert users who still can’t find what they need . If your business has many different objections, this chapter describes how you can overcome every single one of them. Some of the steps may seem obvious, and some may require a lot of discipline to implement, but together they represent the easiest way to grow many businesses. . Step 1: A simple template to manage visitors’ objections (and your counterobjections) . In Section 2, we described how to identify your visitors’ objections. To manage all the responses, we recommend you create what we call an “O/CO” table&mdash;a table with two columns, one for objections and the other for counterobjections. Here’s a template O/CO table: . . You can get an amazing amount of value from populating a simple table of your objections and counterobjections (O/CO). . To begin with, the visitor type and visitor intention should be broad&mdash;for example, “All visitors to ABC.com.” However, if you work for a large enterprise&mdash;a national cell phone carrier, say&mdash;it may be something narrower, like “Visitors who are under contract with another carrier, who are looking for a new phone on a pay-monthly rate plan.” . Into the objections column, add all of your visitors’ objections, as revealed by your research. To make your list more manageable, you may wish to rank the objections by how frequently they get mentioned. . In the counterobjections column, write down the most effective responses you’d give to overcome each objection. You can identify good counterobjections using the following techniques: . Ask salespeople how they respond to each objection. . | Look through the company’s sales training materials and sales scripts to see whether there are prewritten responses to each objection. (If there aren’t, the table you are creating should be added to the company’s sales training course.) . | Ask live chat support representatives how they counter each objection. . | See whether the company has “canned responses” for live chat. They can be a goldmine of tested counterobjections. . | Come up with counterobjections yourself. With most companies, this is the most fruitful method. The people who are best at coming up with counterobjections tend to be intelligent and diligent and have an obsessive knowledge of direct-response marketing techniques, persuasive copywriting, psychology, and usability&mdash;all the core skills of CRO. . | . Step 2: Should you use long or short copy? (Try to reduce how many words you need, by reducing the commitment. And then use as many words as you need.) . Your website will need to contain at least as many words as you’d use when selling face-to-face. . But this raises an important point. Selling what? If your company makes customer-relationship-management (CRM) software, you have a wide choice over what you sell at each stage: . At one extreme, you could aim to complete everything in one step, selling a three-year enterprise-wide contract for the CRM, with a multimillion-dollar commitment. This may require months of face-to-face meetings. . | At the other extreme, you could sell an instant free trial with no credit card required&mdash;and postpone the rest of the selling to a later stage in your conversion funnel. It may take you no more than a minute of conversation to sell a free trial face-to-face. . | . If you ask for less, you don’t need to use as many words. So it pays to explore how you can redesign your conversion funnel so that each step becomes less commitment. . Of all the possible low-commitment steps, lead-generation (or lead-gen) pages deserve a special mention, because they are particularly effective. A lead-gen page is a page designed to collect the visitors’ contact details&mdash;often their email addresses. The “submit your email address” field on a lead-gen page represents a low perceived commitment to the visitor, but a high value to you as a marketer&mdash;because it allows you to lead-nurture the visitor with long copy ad infinitum (or, at least, ad tedium). . Of course, if you lower the commitment at an early stage, bear in mind that you may have simply deferred the commitment&mdash;and the persuasion required&mdash;to a subsequent stage. Sometimes a free trial of the product or service does that persuasion well. Also, it allows you to collect visitor’s contact details. Sometimes a free trial doesn’t work, though, especially if the product or software unavoidably requires the user to commit time or resources. (Commitments can include money, work, time, and risk.) Beware of suboptimizing a particular page only to discover that the problem pops up further down the funnel. A supermarket could get more customers to the checkout by getting the security guards to drag them there&mdash;or by closing off the rest of the store&mdash;but it wouldn’t increase profits. . The most successful online retailers do both: They reduce the commitment required from the buyers by pricing products aggressively low, and then using many words. . In many situations, it’s most effective to offer a dual path: to provide direct, low-commitment calls to action, plus long copy. Successful software companies often provide a low-commitment way forward (a free trial), plus detailed information for those who would prefer it. The calls to action may be scattered throughout the copy, as in the following image: . . Many visitors want to know the features of software before they try it out, so it pays to provide two paths. You can push a low-commitment free trial but also provide pages and pages of information. . Alternatively, the call to action may be in a lead-gen form that’s either static or scrolls down the side of the page: . . Your call to action may sit at the side of your long page. . You can offer as many paths as there are next steps that you’d like the buyer to consider: . . Sometimes it’s optimal to provide multiple paths. This example has three: (1)&nbsp;An order button for visitors who are ready to buy, (2)&nbsp;a button for visitors who want to schedule a trial, and (3)&nbsp;pages and pages of information for visitors who want more details. . Step 3: How to organize your persuasive copy using “separation of concerns” . No matter how long your page is, your visitors should be able to easily find the information they need. They shouldn’t have to read the whole page from start to end. A webpage should be long like a phone book, not like a Russian novel. . Your challenge is thus one of information architecture: How can you organize all the information so that visitors see what they need&mdash;and at the right level of detail&mdash;without getting bored? This is conversion at its hardest. It’s one of the biggest challenges for many websites. It’s also extremely fruitful when you get it right. In the following pages, we present some techniques and concepts that don’t appear in copywriting books. They will help you a great deal. . Separation of concerns is a fancy name for when information is organized and encapsulated into modules. The concept is closely related to the phrase “a place for everything and everything in its place.” Separation of concerns is essential when you’re managing a lot of content. For website design, the modules can be paragraphs, page sections, pages, or groups of pages: . . You can encapsulate benefits into clearly labeled paragraphs. . . Many winning websites clearly encapsulate their content into separate page sections. . . The navigation bars of many websites clearly encapsulate the content into groups of pages. (In one of our case studies, we describe how we used this technique to increase paid memberships for Smart Insights by 75%.) . By modularizing, you allow your visitors to easily find the information that they need, and to ignore the rest. . It’s hard to stress how important it is to organize information into an architecture that’s easy to navigate. Once a visitor is lost, it’s difficult to show them counterobjections. They’ll never find them. . Separation of concerns may seem obvious and straightforward, but once a company does it badly, a mess quickly ensues. We are fans of a particular brand of sit-stand desks. However, whenever we recommend them to people, we struggle to find the version we own (there are over twenty variations, each with subtle differences). The problem is common to many e-commerce websites that give each product variation its own page. The visitor has to play a game of spot the difference between different product pages, many of which are almost identical except for a few differences. . Visitors don’t want to play spot the difference. If they are buying a laptop, they don’t want to browse product names like “ABC123-1Tw, ABC123-2Tb, etc.” Instead, they prefer to see headings that reflect their current mindset and that narrow down the choices. They want to be given choices like “Do you want it with a 1 TB or 2 TB hard drive?” and “Do you want it in black or white?” . . That’s not a store&mdash;it’s a warehouse! This is an example of how an e-commerce page should not look. A product page should help buyers choose between the available options. It shouldn’t be just a database dump. . The following hack is useful if you are unsure of the logic by which your products or services should be sold: Phone the company’s sales department, and ask an open-ended question like “I’m having trouble choosing which sit-stand desk to buy. Could you help me?” Then notice which questions the sales advisor asks. If they are good, they’ll ask questions that narrow down the choices. If they are great, they’ll have a mental logic tree that elegantly narrows down the choices in as few steps as possible. They almost certainly won’t ask what the website asks: “Do you want Product ABC, Product DEF, or Product GHI?” Only a web marketer would do that. . There’s one more reason to clearly modularize your content: If information is hard to find for a visitor, it will also be hard to find for the website’s editors. So it will be even more likely to deteriorate over time. Poor separation of concerns tends to snowball. Some telecoms companies’ websites are messy to the point of being almost irrecoverably out of control. . Step 4: Make it clear where one module ends and the next begins . Once your information is clearly modularized, you need to make it clear where one module ends and the next starts. . You can do this using a hierarchy of text sizes and formatting, as we do in this book, using the following techniques: . Headings (and subheads) clearly show the start of sections (and subsections). However, be aware that readers tend to be less aware of the structure than the writer is. Readers are typically fine with Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles, and tend to be just about okay with Heading 3 styles. By the time a page has reached Heading 4 or below, the readers often struggle to understand where they are in the hierarchy. . | Paragraph returns indicate minor changes of topic. . | The opening sentence of a paragraph often introduces the theme of the paragraph. . | Text in bold (like this) reveals key points, to help skim-readers. . | Bullet-point lists (like this one) represent parallel ideas. . | . Another way to group information is to add background colors to page sections: . . To make it clear where one section ends and another starts, try using alternating gray and white backgrounds. Imagine how much more confusing the page would be without the backgrounds. . Another way to demarcate sections is to put information into boxes: . . It helps to clearly encapsulate content into separate page sections&mdash;which don’t take up any additional space. . Step 5: Optimize your navigation . Good navigation helps users find the information they are seeking. Navigation elements include horizontal and vertical navigation bars, tabs within pages, and on-page Johnson boxes (like the list of links near the top of our article at conversion-rate-experts.com/design). . Your navigation should reflect how your visitors would expect to find things. For example, for an e-commerce fashion retailer… . Users first expect to segment by age/gender (e.g., “Women”) . | And then by type of product (e.g., “Clothing”) . | And then by subcategory (e.g., “Dresses”) . | . The modularization should reflect the visitor’s mental model&mdash;not the mental model of the website’s creator. . When we doubled the sales of the web app PhotoShelter, we achieved a 12% increase merely by optimizing the navigation: . . PhotoShelter’s visitors converted much better after seeing examples. So we added an “Examples” tab to the navigation bar, growing overall sales by 12%. (Image credit: PhotoShelter.) . If you are unsure how to organize your information, card-sorting allows your users to do it for you. . Step 6: Two ways to improve how you label modules . 1. Label each module with a headline that’s clear and descriptive . It’s important to use the right words in a section’s heading. Your words should concisely describe the contents of a section in a way that will be obvious to visitors. Unfortunately, many websites fail in this respect. In many websites’ navigation bars, for example, the headings can be understood only by someone who’s already familiar with the website. For example, companies often use the names of their products in their navigation bars, even when the names aren’t self-explanatory. . You might find it useful to think of it as “surprise navigation.” With surprise navigation, you don’t know what you’re going to get until you’ve got it. Surprise navigation is as pointless as a road sign that can’t be understood until you’ve arrived at the destination. It’s generous to even call it navigation; it’s more like an in-joke. . Surprise navigation isn’t limited to navigation bars; it also appears anywhere that has road sign functionality&mdash;including headlines, subheads, the titles of page sections and other page elements. . Surprise navigation is a common problem; it leads visitors into oblivion, and it kills conversions. . You can eliminate yours by reading all of your headings, including the tabs in your navigation, the headings of pages, and the headings of sections&mdash;and then ensuring that each heading would be understandable to a newcomer. Then, to confirm that you were right, carry out user tests and Treejack tests. . 2. How to fix your headings: Many marketers mistakenly label modules with “categorizers” when they should have used “spoilers” or “teasers” . It’s often not enough for a heading to describe what’s in the module. It should also tease or spoil. . So if your page has a section of media testimonials, introduce it with a spoiler headline. That way, you communicate the message even to skim-readers: . Categorization headline: “Media mentions” (worse) . | Teaser headline: “See what the press are saying about us…” (a bit better) . | Spoiler headline: “We’ve had rave reviews from TIME, CNN, and many others!” (much better) . | . For persuasion, spoiler headlines usually win, because they show the most important information. . However, if you definitely want the user to click through, use a headline that teases, not spoils: . Categorization headline: “A video of a kitten pouncing on a hawk” (worse) . | Spoiler headline: “A kitten pounced on a hawk in a playful way, because they are friends” (no better) . | Teaser headline: “A kitten pounced on a hawk. I was expecting a nasty ending. What happened next was amazing!” (better) . | . Even many professional copywriters make the mistake of using categorization headlines when they should have used spoiler or teaser headlines: . Categorization headline: “Meet the 4th-gen ThinkoStat Learning Thermostat” (worse) . | Teaser headline: “The 4th-Generation ThinkoStat Learning Thermostat. See how we’ve made the best even better.” (better) . | Spoiler headline: “Meet the 4th-Generation ThinkoStat Learning Thermostat: Now it controls your hot water, it’s more beautiful, and it’s even easier to use.” (better) . | . Step 7: How to use “progressive disclosure” to stop your visitors getting lost in the detail (and then abandoning) . Progressive disclosure means hiding information so visitors don’t see it until they need it. We rely heavily on progressive disclosure. It is still greatly underused. . On the web, the most common method of progressive disclosure is to put information onto another page. That way, visitors won’t see the information unless they click on a link to it. This method has drawbacks, though. Once visitors go to another page, they may not return. . It’s often much better to use on-page elements. . Examples of progressive disclosure . The following images show some of the many ways to hide information within a page so it’s revealed only when the user hovers over it or clicks on it: . . Carousels with right and left arrows indicate that more products can be viewed. . . An accordion can be used to hide detail. . . Tooltips are a great way to conceal information until it’s needed. . . It’s possible to use horizontal and vertical carousels in combination, to show two different dimensions of data. For example, in an e-commerce store, you could show thumbnails of color variations on the horizontal axis and photos of different views of the product on the vertical axis. . . When the users hover over an image, an alternative view can be shown. . . Information can be hidden behind a “Read more” link (which, in the context of a bookseller, might sound like a subtly placed marketing slogan). When clicked, the “Read more” turns into “Read less” (which would be a terrible slogan for a bookseller). . . The information in a Help Center can be intuitively categorized into subjects. When the user clicks on a triangle, the answer is revealed. You can keep the answers short by linking to separate pages for users who want even more detail. . . A tooltip can contain any kind of information. . . There’s no limit to what can be put in a tooltip. A travel website may choose to display the times of return trips when the user hovers over the outbound journey. . Progressive disclosure lets you overcome a visitor objection at just the right moment. Visitors to sunshine.co.uk were concerned that the company had no phone number. We wrote a counterobjection that explained why this perceived shortcoming was actually a benefit. We added “Where’s our phone number?” to the header, and linked it to an overlay. This was one of the contributing factors that helped us make an additional $20 million (£14 million) per year for the company. . . By keeping the information in an overlay, sunshine.co.uk was able to counter one of its biggest objections without distracting visitors away from its conversion funnel. . SimpliSafe is an innovative home security company. We have helped it to grow its revenue by more than five times. (Its team members are some of the smartest, most dynamic people we’ve worked with.) Because SimpliSafe’s systems are self-installed by its customers, the customers need a lot of advice. The following images show how SimpliSafe used plus (+) signs to progressively disclose a huge amount of information. . . When clicked, each one of the “+” signs reveals a different overlay (as shown in the following image). (Image credit: SimpliSafe.) . . Each overlay contains enough information to warrant having its own page. But it’s better for it to be in an overlay, so users don’t lose where they are in the conversion funnel. (Image credit: SimpliSafe.) . At the start of this chapter, we described progressive disclosure as hiding information. However, it may be more intuitive to think of progressive disclosure in the positive sense&mdash;as adding information that otherwise may not warrant space on the page. . There are so many ways to progressively disclose information, how do you know where to start? Should you use a tooltip or an exit overlay? In the following pages, we describe the four types of “building blocks” with which you can build progressive-disclosure elements. . Building blocks of progressive disclosure: 1. Ways to indicate that more information can be revealed . You can use any of the following visual text cues to indicate that more information can be revealed: . Arrows, triangles, and chevrons indicate that information will appear as an expanding element. (The following image shows multiple types&mdash;you wouldn’t normally include all of them on one page.): . | Text that’s made to look like a link&mdash;usually by being a different color or underlined&mdash;is often effective and uses no additional space: . | Icons with +, ?, or i on them use little space and hint at the nature of the content that will appear: . | Magnifying glasses, depending on context, can indicate that the resulting information will be zoomed in, or that a search field will appear: . | Nothing&mdash;in other words, no clue that information will be progressively disclosed&mdash;is sometimes the best option. For example, if a user hovers over a particular page element, a tooltip may appear unannounced. Take this approach if you aren’t anxious for the visitor to discover the information, and you don’t want to clutter the interface. . | Elements that are abruptly cut off indicate that there’s a way to reveal the rest of the element. If only part of a photo, for example, is visible, visitors correctly guess that the rest of it can be revealed. (This is one of the techniques we describe on our website in our article about how to make users scroll down your page.): . | . Building blocks of progressive disclosure: 2. Ways to trigger the information . The information can be triggered in several ways: . By users clicking on the area. Use this if you don’t want to show the information unless users are keen to see it: . | By users swiping, as with carousels. (Consider offering clickable arrows too, to supplement the swiping.) Swiping is great for showing a large amount of extra information without disorienting the visitor: . | By users hovering over the area. Use this option if you are keen for the information to be viewed. Touchscreens don’t support hovering, so touchscreen users usually have to click instead: . | When the user scrolls a certain distance down a page: . | When the user appears to be exiting the page, by moving their pointer above the viewport of the browser: . | Some websites effectively do progressive disclosure in reverse; they reveal the information spontaneously when the page loads, and then allow it to be hidden. Some websites display notifications that appear when the page loads and then disappear after a few seconds&mdash;or when the user closes them. Qualaroo’s on-page surveys appear spontaneously but can be hidden by clicking on their “minimize” tabs: . | . Building blocks of progressive disclosure: 3. Formats in which to present the information . The hidden information can appear in several formats: . In a separate page. Do this if you aren’t anxious for the visitor to return to the original page. . | In an overlay. Overlays can be effectively used if you don’t want to distract the visitor from your conversion funnel: . | In a carousel. These come in useful when there’s a lot of similar information to show: . | In a tooltip (which is effectively a small overlay). These are great for small amounts of information. They tend to be anchored to a point on the page, so they can be fiddly when triggered near the edge of the viewport: . | By a page section expanding within the page. These are particularly useful when the information doesn’t need to be hidden again. And when expanding them won’t mess up the layout of the page: . | . Building blocks of progressive disclosure: 4. Ways to trigger the information to be hidden again . The revealed information can be hidden again in several ways: . By disappearing when the user stops hovering over that section. This can help or hinder users, depending on whether they are more likely to have problems continuing to hover over the content (because it’s small) or hiding it (often because it’s large). Hovering doesn’t apply to touchscreens, for which clicking must be used instead: . | By users clicking on a “Close” icon. This is often the best option; users tend to understand it well: . | By users clicking away from the page element. This is convenient for users who are “in the know,” but it isn’t discoverable, so it should be used in addition to showing a “Close” icon: . | Spontaneously after a certain time period. This is often used with information that appeared spontaneously too: . | When the user stops doing whatever triggered the information. . | . Step 8: Fallback options to convert users who still can’t find what they need . Sometimes, visitors will fail to find information no matter how well you have structured it. . In such cases, the following fallback options can be effective: . A search box: Search can help users to find what they need, but only at the expense of “teleporting” them into a different part of your website. Once they arrive on the search results page, they often lose their bearings. Once in a while, look through the queries in your search logs to identify which information the visitors had failed to find while browsing. Often, you’ll find that the information wasn’t where users would have expected it to be. . | A knowledge base: Knowledge bases can help users find answers to their questions. But, as with search boxes, visitors who search knowledge bases often lose where they were in the conversion funnel. . | Live chat: A live chat operator should be able to find information that the visitor can’t. Whether live chat is economically viable depends on the economics of your business (and not on the whims of the customer-support team). . | A prominently placed phone number: Not all visitors want to pick up the phone. But for those who do, phone calls tend to convert extremely well. The main drawback of phone calls is that they don’t scale easily; call center operatives need hiring, training, paying(!), and looking after. As such, the ideal combination is usually for the website to do as much of the work as possible. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-1&quot;&gt; Winning websites…sail past the competition: if your visitors are choosing your competitors, here’s how to win . If you don’t have a strategy for winning despite competitors, you are doomed. . This chapter describes many powerful concepts and techniques we have used to help our clients dominate in some of the world’s most competitive markets. . Some of the things you’ll get in this chapter: . four reasons why niching usually wins; . | how to spot good niches: three easy techniques you can use; . | six ways to spot opportunities your competitors will ignore; and . | some funny photos of good and bad competitive strategies. . | . How to make your visitors choose you (and not your competitors) . No company exists in a vacuum. Sometimes, visitors abandon your website simply because they prefer the website of one of your competitors. . How can you win the sale? . You could attempt to become better than all of your competitors in every way, but it’s hard being all things to all people. It’s much more effective to niche&mdash;to focus your efforts on being the best in a small number of dimensions. . You can be the best by providing a subset of features that some people would love: . Budget airlines chose a single dimension in which to excel: low headline prices. They lowered headline prices by cutting costs and turning many features into optional upsells, capturing the (large) segment of the market that made its decision based primarily on headline price. . | Our client daFlores is an e-commerce store that became successful by delivering a restricted range of products&mdash;flowers&mdash;to a restricted geographical location&mdash;Latin America&mdash;at a time when its competitors hadn’t established the infrastructure to provide this service. . | . Often, you can niche by targeting a particular group of customers. For example, . Our client Voices.com is a job website that serves only voice-over artists and people who are seeking voice-over artists. . | Our client Moz serves SEOs. Moz’s product has changed over the years, but its target market has remained roughly the same throughout. . | . Niching often wins . When you niche your service to a particular group of needs or customers, you get several powerful advantages. To illustrate the point, consider shampoo. If you study the shelves of a supermarket, you’ll see shampoo for the following: . Oily, itchy, and greasy hair . | Heavily dandruffy hair . | Suave professional hair . | Hair with fox poo it (to be fair, this one may not be in the same section of the supermarket) . | . In fact, you’d struggle to find general-purpose shampoo that isn’t niched to a particular type of hair. . Niched shampoos have displaced all the non-niched ones, because they have been more successful with customers. . Four reasons why niching usually wins . . An un-niched service (though clearly a multitalented person). . Niching is effective for several reasons: . A niched product is worded in terms of the customer’s needs. The niched product effectively says, “I understand your situation, and I am a ready-made solution for it.” It’s hard to overlook a product that has been designed to satisfy your exact need. . | People are aware that niched things are often better. A surgeon who specializes in a rare type of gastric operation will tend to be better at it than a surgeon who hasn’t. Specialists tend to be more proficient than generalists, because they have focused their resources on solving a narrower problem. As a result, most people recognize that specialization is an indicator of high performance. So even if all shampoo bottles were to contain the same ingredients, customers would still expect the specialist ones to be better. . | Niching allows you to become the best in the world. No one checks into a hotel and asks the concierge, “What’s the second-best Chinese restaurant nearby?” Seth Godin argues that buyers always want the best in the world. Though he admits that “the best” depends on what the target segment wants (e.g., Chinese food), and that “the world” may be restricted (e.g., to restaurants within a certain distance of the hotel). Godin argues that, to be successful, a person or company must define the “world” it will be best in, and what it means by “best.” And then, crucially, to not fall short. . | Things that are niched get attention. All death-metal bands have similar logos. Except for the band “Party Cannon.” See if you can spot Party Cannon’s logo: . | . Going to a death-metal festival? See if you can spot Party Cannon’s logo. (Image credit: Party Cannon.) . “Each time our logo goes viral, we gain fans.” &mdash;Chris, Party Cannon . Niching works best for marginal outsiders . Niching works best in marketplaces that are noisy and overcrowded. By being distinctive, you win a disproportionate amount of attention. . Once you have grown to saturate your niche, though, you need to satisfy more people and needs. At that point, the winning strategy is to become less niched and more moderate. . You see this happen during TV talent shows and political campaigns. At the start of a political campaign, a candidate benefits from being extreme. As the campaign progresses, and competitors are eliminated, strategic candidates tend to mellow, sacrificing attention-getting antics in order to appeal to a broader audience. . Tread on as few toes as possible . The software company HubSpot refuses to offer consulting services. Instead, it operates a partner program for agencies. As a result, many consultancies around the world evangelize HubSpot. If HubSpot had chosen to offer consultancy services, those same companies would have actively avoided recommending HubSpot. . By being niched and focused, your company can be symbiotic with other businesses. Neighboring companies become allies. . By being unfocused and broad, your company treads on more toes. Those allies become competitors. . Exercise restraint when widening the scope of your services. Try to minimize your number of competitors. Keep your footprint small. . How to spot good niches: Three easy techniques you can use . The following techniques help you to reliably identify good niches: . Look back at the success you have had over the past year. You may find that it has a theme. You may have already started niching inadvertently. Amplify that niching by communicating it to your visitors. In his book Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Peter Drucker describes how Macy’s department store initially downplayed the growing effect of appliance sales on its profits. It considered the sales to be an “embarrassing success.” Macy’s profits rose only once it embraced appliance sales as a part of its image. . | As markets grow, they fragment. If you can pick the next dimension along which your market will fragment, you can get there first. Match.com used to be the only dating website anyone had heard of. As the industry grew, many niched dating websites became successful. There are now successful dating websites aimed at… . long-term relationships (eHarmony); . | time-starved professionals (Lovestruck); . | people who don’t want to pay (PlentyOfFish); . | people of certain religions (ChristianMingle); . | country folk (Muddy Matches); . | and, ahem, Tinder. . | . | What is luxury today will be mainstream tomorrow. Study your most advanced, sophisticated, wealthiest users. The problems they have today&mdash;and the solutions they use&mdash;will soon be mass market. Such users give you a glimpse of the future. When plasma TVs first came out, they were used only by exhibitors at trade shows. As prices fell, plasma TVs began to be bought by public venues like bars. It took years before they began to be bought for domestic use. What are your sophisticated users buying today? How can you help to make that service mainstream? . | Niching works best when you create a new category . When we started working with Mobal, it rented phones to international travelers. So did its competitors. We created a new value proposition for Mobal: a travel-phone you could own for just $49, with no monthly fees. . Suddenly, Mobal was no longer one of many phone-rental companies; it was the $49-travel-phone company. Reviews in travel magazines would say, “If you need a phone when you’re abroad, you have two options: (1) rent one or (2) buy a Mobal phone.” . By creating a new category, Mobal became 50% of the available options. And gained free coverage in TIME, Inc., The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and almost every travel magazine. . Seven ways to spot niching opportunities your competitors will ignore . One of the most common mistakes is simply to identify an opportunity, and then aim to capture it. Just because something is an opportunity today doesn’t mean it’s worth chasing. . Instead, look for opportunities that you can seize without a struggle, because your competitors won’t stop you. . List your opportunities, and then run them through the following checklist, to identify which of them your competitors are likely to avoid: . Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because it runs against their strategy, their brand, and what they stand for: If Rolex was to start making cars, you could predict with reasonable confidence that it would target the luxury end of the market. Rolex would be unlikely to compete with a company that sells low-end cars. If Ikea were to launch a car, on the other hand, you might expect it to be lower priced and more functionally designed. And maybe you’d need to assemble the engine yourself. Ikea would, therefore, be less likely to compete with a company that sells luxury cars. . | Coca-Cola brands itself as being an age-old classic. Pepsi is therefore safe to position itself as being modern, because Coca-Cola will not attempt to occupy that position. . | Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because it would disrupt their existing business: When Google first made its office software free, it was safe to assume that Microsoft wouldn’t do the same. Such a move would have undermined too much of Microsoft’s revenue. In his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, Clayton Christensen calls this principle dependency. Companies depend on their existing customers, revenue, and investors and are unlikely to upset them. . | You ideally want to focus on an opportunity that will inevitably grow&mdash;to “skate where the puck is going.” Fortunately, many competitors will avoid such an opportunity because it isn’t big enough yet. This leaves a gap that you can fill. Even when an opportunity will imminently become large, many competitors will ignore it until it happens. . | Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because they have a track record of failing at that activity. Or not even trying. If a company has always failed at something, or has always avoided doing it, you can predict with reasonable confidence that it will continue to do the same. Often, you’ll never find out the reasons. Fortunately, you don’t need to. For example, when Yahoo! acquires a tech company, you can be reasonably confident that the tech company will no longer be a threat. . | Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because it doesn’t match their strengths. In this respect, it’s helpful to consider what Guy Kawasaki calls “your unfair advantages.” . | Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because they don’t know something that you do. Your experience may reveal an opportunity that other companies wouldn’t even recognize or appreciate. . | Are the following psychological biases stopping you from niching? . If niching is so effective, why do so few companies do it? Because niching means overcoming three types of psychological discomfort: . Discomfort 1: Focus = Neglect . Many people agree that they need to focus more. But they think that focus means concentrate. It doesn’t. Focus means neglect. As Steve Jobs said, “Focus means saying no to the hundred other good ideas.” Focusing doesn’t feel empowering; it feels embarrassing, upsetting, and scary. A sign that you are focusing is that you frequently cringe at the things you aren’t doing. Your head knows you are doing the right thing, but your stomach turns at the things you are neglecting. . How can you overcome the cringing feeling? Remind yourself that your neglect can be temporary. Once you dominate a particular niche, you can incrementally expand the scope of your business. As Amazon has done. Amazon started by being a bookstore and is heading toward being an everything store. . Discomfort 2: You must ignore social proof . If you see people running out of a building, you would be wise to copy them; maybe the building is on fire. People trust social proof because it’s often a reliable indicator. However, it can work against you. Next time your market research reveals an opportunity and you wonder why no one else has tried it, be aware that your desire for social proof might be the only thing standing between you and success. . Discomfort 3: You mustn’t conform . We tend to behave like those around us, to be liked or accepted. This same instinct can cause marketers to feel a twinge of discomfort every time they stray from the norm. But niching means doing things that others don’t. So next time you feel a twinge of awkwardness because your company is doing something eccentric&mdash;because you are sticking your neck out&mdash;remind yourself that your desire for conformity might be holding you back. . The riches in niches . The best way to “beat your competitors” is often to redefine yourself so that you have fewer of them. . Be prepared to go to war, but choose your battles wisely. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-61&quot;&gt; Winning websites…keep attention: if your visitors are forgetting about you, here’s how to make them keep coming back . . Your visitors’ browsing sessions can get sidetracked by real life. This family, for example, could possibly get distracted by eating, parenting, or the inevitable breakdown of their relationships. . Your visitors aren’t all sitting in a usability testing lab in isolation. They are real people living real lives: . Their kids might ask to be fed, and they have to abandon their online shopping to go and “cook” a bowl of breakfast cereal. . | Their taxi driver might arrive to take them to line dancing. . | Their dog might knock a glass of red wine onto the floor, and so they hurriedly abandon the life insurance form they were completing, and instead spend the next twenty minutes mopping an excellently clingy shiraz with apricot top notes out of their rug. . | . Stuff like that. Real lives can be distracting. . Once your visitors are distracted, they may never come back. How can you, as a web marketer, overcome those problems? You can’t make breakfast. You can’t postpone line dancing. You can’t absorb wine. So how can you make those visitors come back? . Solution 1: Be memorable enough so that they return . There are many ways to be memorable. Here are just three examples: . Have a memorable name: Once someone has heard the name SurveyMonkey, they are likely to remember it. That’s a conversion benefit that many of SurveyMonkey’s competitors&mdash;Typeform, for example&mdash;don’t have. If you want to create a great, memorable name for your product or company, we highly recommend you get the book “Hello, My Name is Awesome” by Alexandra Watkins. Alexandra’s company, Eat My Words, also offers a useful free PDF. . | Have an entertaining message: Dollar Shave Club became famous overnight with a video ad that went viral. Within four years, it sold to Unilever for $1 billion. . | Be different: LingsCars is a real business. It’s much larger than it appears. It achieves memorability by looking absolutely crazy. . | . . Dollar Shave Club became successful off the back of its entertaining explainer video. . . You probably wouldn’t want to replicate it, but LingsCars shows how successful a company can be just by standing out. . Solution 2: Establish ways to communicate with the visitors on an ongoing basis . If you can get your visitors’ contact details, or persuade them to follow you, then the pressure’s off. You no longer need to persuade them in a single session; you can do it over a period of days, weeks, months, or years. . The following techniques turn a one-time visit into an ongoing conversation&mdash;making your business resilient to taxis, wine stains, hungry kids, and whatever else life throws at your visitors. . Offer a no-brainer deal with a tiny commitment. Consider how you could greatly increase the conversion rate of the first visit by greatly reducing the commitment your visitors need to make. We described this in detail in “Step 2: Should you use long or short copy?” . | Persuade your visitors to follow you on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, or whichever social network is used most in your industry. . | Use ad retargeting to persuade your visitors to come back. Retargeted ads are particularly effective. Visitors who visited once tend to be extremely likely to visit again. . | Collect your visitors’ contact details&mdash;their email addresses, postal addresses, and/or phone numbers&mdash;and then create a follow-up flow that keeps their attention and persuades them to proceed. In many industries&mdash;such as education&mdash;this beats everything else. . | . . Many companies ask for contact details as soon as the visitors arrive. It may seem a bit “forward” but it works. . . The university-degrees niche is highly competitive. The winning call to action tends to be to collect contact details and then follow up via email and phone. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-20&quot;&gt; Winning websites…get prompt action: if your visitors are taking their time, here’s how to get them to act immediately . In exit surveys, visitors often report that they need to go away and think about it. Such responses are particularly common for purchases that are complex and nonurgent. . In such cases, the best solution is usually to look for reasons for urgency. . How travel agents use urgency . The travel industry is masterful at finding reasons for urgency and scarcity&mdash;which it expresses frequently throughout booking processes. At every step, there is a genuine reason for the visitor to hurry up. . Let’s look for a hotel in New York and see the techniques in action: . . Notifications often appear over the page a few seconds after it loads, capturing the visitors’ attention. . Within seconds of the page loading, a first notification appears in the top-right corner: . . An urgency notification. . Ah, so it’s a competition! This communicates scarcity and urgency. Almost immediately, a second notification appears: . . Another urgency notification. . So those fourteen people aren’t just looking; they’re booking. Note how the specific details make the urgency more palpable. . A third notification appears: . . Another urgency notification. . So not only are rooms selling out, they are becoming more expensive! . And then: . . A notification to communicate low commitment and to reduce the perceived risk. . which lowers the perceived risk of acting urgently. . A minute ago, we were idly browsing hotels. We didn’t even know there was a Novotel hotel in Times Square. Now we are caught in a Black Friday-style stampede for it. . Notice how the page elements above don’t just repeat the same message. They manage to express urgency in many subtly different ways. . Framing gains as losses . Ticket brokers focus on urgency too. Imagine you receive an email announcing that an ’80s soft metal band are having a reunion tour. You click on it out of curiosity. Before you know it, the ticket broker has reserved particular seats for you, and then show a timer at the side of the page: . . A timer on a checkout page adds urgency&mdash;particularly when it’s getting close to zero. . It’s the only animated part of the page, so it flickers its message of urgency in the corner of your eye as you study the page. . This alert doesn’t just express urgency. It has turned the decision into a fear of loss. The seat numbers have already been reserved for you; now you just need to decide whether to abandon them or not. According to Prospect Theory, changes that are framed as losses are weighed much more heavily than changes that are framed as gains. . And before you can say “soft-rock poodle perm,” you have bought tickets to see 90 minutes of new romantic power ballads. . How some companies build scarcity into their offers . In our experience, almost all businesses have genuine scarcity and urgency. . However, many companies manufacture scarcity and urgency, in the same way that they manufacture their products. Manufacturers of luxury goods, like Rolex, Ferrari, Louis Vuitton, build scarcity into their marketing plans. . Even if the product isn’t scarce, the offer can be. Companies like Bose create rolling time-limited offers. For example, Bose might offer free accessories for anyone who orders by the end of the month. But what happens the following month? No more offer? Instead, the offer simply switches to another time-limited offer, which expires at the end of that month. Such offers allow the company to always have a reason for the visitor to act promptly. An extreme example of rolling time-limited offers are daily deals websites. . Principles of urgency . Urgency is about time. Explore reasons why your visitors should act promptly: . Whenever possible, have a deadline, and always give a reason why the deadline exists. . | If there are no inevitable deadlines, consider creating deadlines. For example, offer a premium or discount for people who respond within a certain period. (For example, conferences usually have an early bird registration period.) . | Look for scarcity in your business. Scarcity causes an inevitable deadline&mdash;the time at which the scarce resource runs out. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-74&quot;&gt; Winning websites…thrive in an imperfect world: if parts of your sales funnel are outside of your control (and are terrible), here’s how to win regardless . Are parts of your sales funnel outside of your control? . Many marketers have their hands tied, unable to edit crucial parts of their funnels. . This is particularly common for businesses that are paid for generating leads for other businesses&mdash;for example, for financial services, education, health care, or real estate: . A financial services company might send its visitors to an application form on a bank’s website. If the bank’s website is terrible (many are), what can the financial services company do? . | A college education broker might send its leads to an application form on a particular college’s website. If the college’s website is terrible (many are), what can the broker do? . | A real estate broker or a health care provider might send its visitors to a local sales team that is terrible at closing the deal (many are). What can the real estate broker do? . | . The problem also occurs when part of the funnel is managed by a different department that isn’t interested in doing CRO. This happens surprisingly often. For example, many of our clients hire us for help with their marketing materials, but then discover through our research that numerous opportunities lie within the onboarding and usability of the product itself. This is really common with web app companies. . The “other” part of the organization is typically much worse at CRO. (We presume it’s because of the Dunning-Kruger effect; people who lack particular skills also lack the metacognition to appreciate their lack of skills.) . Regardless, it’s frustrating&mdash;for your visitors, who have to face the Handover of Death, and for you, who knows it could be prevented. . . How can you protect your visitors from the Handover of Death? . Seven effective remedies for when you don’t control the conversion page . Here’s what you can do to fix the problem: . 1. Ensure your visitors are fully persuaded . Ensure that your visitors are fully persuaded before they leave your website. Don’t rush them to leave. Don’t push them into a checkout process, for example, before they are persuaded to take action. . 2. Ensure your visitors qualify . Before your visitors leave, ensure that they qualify for the product they are considering. Financial products, for example, often have many qualification criteria. If you send a visitor to apply for a mortgage that they aren’t qualified for, they won’t (can’t, in fact) convert, and you are unlikely to see them again. . 3. Hustle your tracking code onto the ultimate conversion page . If you are only able to track when someone clicks away from your website, you will optimize your business for click-outs, not for conversions. So do whatever you can to put tracking code on the ultimate conversion page&mdash;even if it takes some negotiating and hustling. That way, you can optimize for the true goal. . 4. Be a destination, not just the station . Build a relationship with your visitors. You don’t want to simply be the station that your visitors pass through on the way to their final destination. Find ways of providing value to them, so they come to see you as a trusted advisor. Get their contact details, or get them to follow you on social media, so they remember to return next time they need your advice. . 5. Be memorable . Be memorable in terms of your name and branding, so that visitors think of you next time they have the same need. . 6. Have a reason why visitors should order via you . Offer visitors a reason to order via you rather than via a competitor. A highly effective technique is to give away information, because the marginal cost of doing so is almost zero, yet it can provide significant value to the customer. Information can be a deal maker. Shell Oil did this with outrageous success by giving away booklets about motoring. The booklets had titles like “How you can spot some car problems before they cost big money” and “How to save gasoline when you buy a car, drive a car, and take care of a car.” The campaign was reported to be Shell’s most successful ever, with three hundred million booklets given away. . 7. Expand your influence . Do whatever you can to get permission to edit those parts of the funnel that aren’t in your control. One of our clients, a phone company, discovered that one-third of all its inbound calls were from customers inquiring how to use the travel adapters that came free with the phones. We decided to contact the company that made the travel adapters and offered to redesign its packaging to make it more usable. After several rounds of iteratively designing and then usability testing, we sent off the much-improved packaging designs to the manufacturer. Several weeks later, when customers started receiving the newly designed travel adapters, the problematic inbound customer calls dropped to zero. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-34&quot;&gt; Winning websites…have a huge lifetime customer value (LCV): how to identify opportunities to increase your LCV, the powerful conversion metric that people forget about . Some people wrongly believe that CRO stops when a customer places an order. In fact, increasing repeat purchases is one of the easiest ways to grow your business. Another is to enthuse customers to tell their friends. In this chapter, you’ll learn some techniques to turn visitors into raving fans who love your company, spend a lot, and tell their friends to do the same. . . . . Your conversion funnel extends to the whole customer experience&mdash;and beyond. . To win at conversion, you must win at LCV. The most successful companies can outbid their competitors in advertising&mdash;not just because they outconvert their competitors, but also because their customers keep returning to spend more. That way, the cost of acquiring a customer can be recouped over the total lifetime of the customer. . Furthermore, existing customers are easier to convert&mdash;provided they had a good experience the first time round. . So how can you get customers to spend more, and more often? We have worked with many companies, and we have noticed commonalities in the ones that have become most successful. The following sections reveal our observations on what works. . A mindset to maximize LCV . Does success come to those who deserve it? . Until recently, the answer was no. But the world is changing quickly, and the answer is moving toward yes. Good people&mdash;and good companies&mdash;are increasingly getting what they deserve. The phrase “If you build it, they will come” used to be a “falsism.” But the internet has made consumers much better at finding great products and services. . Here’s an example. In the past, a bad restaurant in a tourist hotspot could prosper by preying on an endless supply of naive customers. Now, thanks to websites like TripAdvisor, prospective diners can find out the truth. So diners go to the best restaurants and they avoid the bad ones. The top-rated restaurants get almost all of the money. . If we ran a restaurant, we’d focus on delivering value&mdash;by cooking great food and making customers happy&mdash;in the firm belief that everything else would look after itself, because the truth would get out. . If your core value isn’t high, you’ll get almost no rewards until you become the best available option for your target market&mdash;at which point the rewards come rushing in. Because everyone wants the best. No one goes shopping for their second-best option. . So if you were running a restaurant, you’d want your food and service to be not just good but the best, and you’d want your employees to be not just happy but the happiest, because being best is disproportionately more fruitful than being second, third, or fourth. (Of course, the definition of best requires you to niche to a particular target market and a particular offering; a fast-food restaurant is the best at satisfying particular needs of particular customers.) . So we advise our clients to “become deserving of what you want.” To build a company that deserves to be hugely successful, because it’s the best in the world at delivering value. To focus their efforts on delivering and improving every aspect of their service. . This isn’t just nice-to-hear fluff. Many marketers are attracted to short-term hacks and black-hat secrets. (If you ever go to a conference where one of the talks has a title that mentions sneaky tricks, notice how full the room is.) . Companies that win at conversion tend to be those that aim to build something great. . Use Net Promoter Score to improve customer happiness . How can you measure whether you’re turning visitors into raving fans? Net Promoter Score (NPS) can be simple and effective. To measure your raving-fan-ness, simply ask your customers the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?” You then calculate the percentage of respondents who gave scores of 9 or 10 (NPS calls those people “Promoters”), and then subtract the percentage of respondents who gave scores of 0 to 6 (NPS calls them “Detractors”). The theory is that Promoters will grow your business via word of mouth and that Detractors will shrink your business via word of mouth. An NPS of +100 would mean that every customer would be a raving fan, evangelizing you wherever they go. An NPS of &ndash;100 would mean the opposite, that every customer is out there complaining. NPS isn’t just useful as a metric; it’s useful as a concept. An NPS of +100 is a guiding star that every team member can envisage and strive for. . Your raving fans are likely to make subsequent purchases, and they are likely to recommend you to their friends. . Upsell and cross-sell . In addition to selling more of the same thing, you can also increase LCV by satisfying additional needs. In the chapter about giving people what they want, we described a process to identify what your customers will buy from you, and how to explore which of those opportunities will make the biggest impact. . No bounds: Let CRO permeate every aspect of a business . One of our clients sells sheds online. Our CEO, Ben, was the most in need of a new shed. (More accurately, he was the person least reluctant to get one.) Ben had many insights during the buying process. One of the more interesting insights came once the shed was delivered to the front of his house. Ben discovered that the shed’s components would not fit easily through a standard doorway. They scraped the paint off the house’s door frame. Based on this feedback, our client redesigned all its sheds so that no component was too large to fit through a doorway. This improved the client’s customer feedback rating, which was already high. . . In buying and constructing this shed, Ben made an observation that led to the manufacturer redesigning its entire range. . Some people would deem shed-testing to be outside of the remit of CRO. But you can apply your CRO skills to every aspect of a business, throughout the whole customer experience. We’ve applied CRO to offline advertising, explainer videos, product design, sales scripts, recruitment funnels, training programs&mdash;you name it, we’ve optimized it. . The following activities are often effective at increasing customer satisfaction and LCV: . Building the relationship with visitors via regular follow-up&mdash;with an email autoresponder sequence or a lead-generation welcome pack. . | Being more than a store. Becoming a community and/or a trusted advisor. . | Creating and optimizing a refer-a-friend program. . | Cross-selling on your thank-you page. This can increase the net profit considerably, because you have already acquired the customers, so the additional gross profit goes straight to the bottom line. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-50&quot;&gt; Section 4: See the power of CRO in action. A case study showing exactly how we grew a company at record-breaking speed . . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-30&quot;&gt; A useful case study in conversion: how we helped grow a company by 470% in a year . . We helped goHenry to grow by 470% in one year. . It can help to see how a project flows from start to finish. In this section, we describe a project that helped a client of ours to grow by 470%. . In early 2015, goHenry hired us to increase the effectiveness of its digital marketing and grow its market share. goHenry is a financial-technology (FinTech) company that combines web and mobile apps to create a unique learning tool for children. It ranked in the FinTech&nbsp;100, a list of the top companies in FinTech. . This section describes some of the things we’ve done. Note that we refers to a team effort between Conversion Rate Experts (with our expertise and proven system) and goHenry (with its highly effective team). . . goHenry’s growth was faster than the winner of the Sunday Times Fast Track 100. . Identifying the biggest opportunity, and adopting a mobile-led approach to optimization . goHenry brought us in because it recognized that there was an opportunity to adopt a faster-moving, more experimental culture. . When we start working with new clients, we look for the big opportunities, the changes we can put in place quickly that will have a lasting&mdash;and scalable&mdash;effect on the business. . We used the following techniques to help identify the opportunities for goHenry: . We studied its analytics data to understand existing traffic sources&mdash;which channels were converting best, and where were the big opportunities for growth. . | We had a session with the goHenry team to discuss its current approach to making changes on the website. . | We mapped the different aspects of the company’s business model, to identify its “winning business model.” . | We took time to understand the regulatory regime in which goHenry operates (which can be particularly onerous for FinTech companies). . | . Two of the conclusions from the research were especially interesting: . The winning business model for goHenry required it to grow incredibly quickly&mdash;a strategy that we’ve applied successfully with many of our clients. Businesses like this tend to be “winner takes all.” goHenry had the first-mover advantage, which can be formidable provided the pace is kept up. So goHenry would need an approach to optimization that was lean and structured. . | The success of goHenry depended on mobile users, so we’d need to build the workflow around mobile from the get-go. . | . Stepping into the visitors’ shoes&mdash;and why you should focus on mobile in isolation . Before we made any changes on the website, we listened to what the visitors were telling us. Because goHenry’s visitors were on mobile devices, we listened to what the mobile visitors were telling us. It sounds obvious, but it’s often overlooked&mdash;even by companies with sophisticated mobile websites. . Don’t assume that your mobile visitors are just desktop visitors on a different device. If you do, you’ll focus on the user interface as the only difference between the two. . In fact&mdash;as we discovered when we gathered data on goHenry’s visitors&mdash;mobile users can have very different intentions, likes, and objections to their desktop counterparts. You’ll need to address these specifically on your mobile journey. . Some things we learned about goHenry’s mobile visitors (and how they’re different from desktop visitors) . The difference between mobile users and desktop users isn’t just about screen size. Mobile users are more likely to have arrived from a social network, so they were different in the following respects: . Mobile users were more impulsive. Many landed on the website on a whim&mdash;so knew much less about what was being offered. That’s bad news when you’re selling a new and innovative product, like goHenry. . | They were 50% less likely to have their children with them when they signed up. Remember, goHenry is a product for children, so this affected the mechanics of the new funnel as well as the messaging we used. . | They were 40% more likely to have concerns about trust and security (which are tough objections for a FinTech to overcome). . | . Gather and analyze data on your mobile visitors in isolation&mdash;otherwise valuable insights could be lost in the noise. . Knee-deep in insights about goHenry’s mobile visitors, we set about designing a new mobile conversion funnel. . Here’s what happened. . A new mobile landing page increased sign-ups by 78% . Using our insights on mobile visitors&mdash;and our workflow for developing high-converting pages for them&mdash;we created a new landing page for goHenry. . It won an A/B test convincingly, increasing sign-ups by 78% over the original. Here it is: . . At 2.5 m tall on mobile, our new page may have problems getting through doorways, but it had no problem beating the original page by 78%. . There are loads of reasons why our new page beat the original. Here are just some of the proven techniques we used: . Reasons it won: 1. We had a long story to tell, so we created a long page . Our mobile visitors were intrigued but had many strong objections&mdash;as you would expect when selling a new financial product for children. . A long page allows us to systematically address all of the key objections, starting with the strongest. . Then, as each objection was addressed, we gave the prospect an opportunity to proceed through the funnel by sprinkling the “call to action” throughout the page. This effectively made the page as short as possible&mdash;but as long as necessary. This was particularly important on mobile. . There’s no such thing as a too-long page&mdash;only a too-boring one. So we had to ensure that the page was engaging from top to bottom. . Reasons it won: 2. We used visual ways to present the information . Our research revealed that mobile visitors landed on the website with only a vague idea of what was being offered. Coupled with their strong objections, we were dealing with seriously volatile visitors, liable to self-destruct (leave the website) at any time. . We had to find ways to get our message across quickly. . . Just some of the ways we used to communicate the offer on mobile (all taken from the same page). . Notice that the previous techniques use visual methods for presenting complex information. Done right, this can be especially effective on mobile, where attention spans are as small as the screens. . Reasons it won: 3. We built trust and credibility&mdash;fast . Selling a new financial product and selling a new product for children are two of the toughest gigs in town. Buyers understandably have issues with trust and credibility. . Combining the two&mdash;selling a new financial product for children&mdash;is particularly difficult. . This became obvious when we looked at our research data. . . By using the trust inherent in the Visa brand, we wiped out issues with trust and credibility. . We needed something that would wipe out trust issues fast. . The answer lay in the fact that goHenry is backed by Visa, one of the world’s most well-known and trusted financial institutions. . By positioning Visa much more prominently as part of the proposition&mdash;showing it even more prominently than the goHenry brand&mdash;we reassured visitors that goHenry was associated with a brand they already trusted. . Do you have similar examples of “hidden wealth” in your business? Most of our clients have elements that could be highly persuasive to prospects, but that the prospects rarely see. Used correctly, such persuasion assets can be amazingly effective. It’s worth thoroughly searching your own business. Often, a fresh pair of eyes will spot something you’ve overlooked. . We created a 191% increase from optimizing mobile Facebook ads . When you’ve gathered loads of insights on your visitors, it’s crazy to focus only on the website. Every interaction a prospect, visitor, or customer has with your business is an opportunity for optimization. Constantly look for other areas to apply your learning. We use our research across all areas of the business, including offline. . Facebook was goHenry’s primary source of acquisition, so it was an obvious candidate for us to work on. We optimized goHenry’s Facebook ad campaign, applying multivariate testing to its ad creatives. By sending the ads to our winning landing pages, we increased the number of sign-ups by 191% (that’s nearly three times). . . Over a period of several months, we multivariate tested over 100 Facebook ads. . We created a 36% increase in sign-ups from optimizing the pricing page . We knew that price was a major pain point for prospects, so we turned our attention to the pricing page. Also, prospects had objections about being locked in and how to cancel the subscription. . We designed a new page to address these issues. It increased sign-ups by 36% over the original: . . During the A/B test, our new pricing page beat the control by 36%. You’ll see that it includes more salesmanship than the original. Many companies make the mistake of assuming that they don’t need to do any selling on their pricing page. . Here are some of the ways we addressed the pricing and trust objections: . . In the absence of obvious competitors to goHenry, prospects were using bank accounts as their “frame of reference.” But bank accounts are free. We communicated that goHenry is much more than a payment account&mdash;it’s an online learning tool. As such, its price is extremely low. . . Pricing objections peaked on the pricing page, so that’s where we added our primary counterobjection: the free trial. . . On the pricing page, don’t forget to remind prospects of the value of your product. We added a section covering all the great free features bundled with goHenry and an image showing how much “stuff” you get. . We created a 23% increase in sign-ups from homepage optimization . We’ve already described how our new landing page beat the original by 78%. . Next, we tested it against the current homepage. It won again, by 23%. . It won because our research told us that half of the visitors to the homepage were originally from the same source as those on the landing page&mdash;they were just returning for a second look. So it followed that they would have the same objections and be persuaded by the same appeals. . How did we know this? We asked them. . . Recycle, recycle, recycle&mdash;if you have winning content, look for other places you can use it. . Do you know where your customers come from? If you don’t, ask them the following question: “Where did you first hear about us?” . You might be surprised at the answer. . We created an 8% uplift in card activations from optimizing the postsale pages . Having made a huge impact increasing sign-ups, we turned our attention to the activation funnel. When a child’s card arrives in the mail, the parent must first activate it before it can be used. This stage is crucial for goHenry; each unactivated card is wasted money. . Before we began optimizing the card-activation stage, we carried out dedicated usability studies. The studies revealed two main issues: . The activation process began with the standard member log-in screen. Many parents didn’t consider themselves members at this point, so weren’t sure they were in the right place. . | There were several “cognitive barriers” on the journey, things that made members stop and think, diverting attention from the task at hand. . | . When we designed a new funnel to address these issues, card activations increased by 8%. . . Signpost your website so that visitors know they’re in the right place. . . Be ruthlessly minimal when designing your journeys&mdash;focus only on what’s necessary to complete the task at hand. When parents were asked to load money into their account, they had to define the amount in terms of a weekly allowance (unnecessary decision #1), and how many weeks’ allowance to add (unnecessary decision #2). Our new design removed both of these decisions. . We created an 11% uplift in card activations from optimizing the offline journey . Don’t just limit optimization to your website. If part of your journey happens offline, optimize that too. . That’s exactly what we did with goHenry’s card activation journey. . Our research told us that half of the children knew about the card before it arrived in the mail. Now, if you’ve got kids you’ll know how persuasive they can be, so it came as no surprise that parents were more likely to activate when their child knew about the card. . It followed that if we could make more kids aware of the card, more cards would be activated. . So we sent the welcome letter to the kids instead. After all, the purpose of goHenry is to teach children financial responsibility. . The result? Card activations increased by 11%. . . By sending the card and letter to kids (the letter on the right), we increased activations by 11%, as measured using an offline A/B test. . Some of the tools we used on the goHenry project . Here are just a few of them: . We use Qualaroo or Hotjar to add mobile-specific pop-up surveys to key pages. . | Each interaction between finger and screen expresses an intent&mdash;and you need to understand what it is. Tools like Hotjar, Crazy Egg, and Inspectlet will help you do just that. . | For maximum insights, use mobile screen recording software to capture usability tests (or simply record the test on another device). We use Lookback to build an army of usability testers&mdash;or test recruiters&mdash;and have the videos land right in your inbox. It will even film the subject’s face during the test. . | If you can’t get friends or colleagues to help, use websites like UserTesting.com to do remote usability testing on mobile. (Tip: we love UserTesting.com’s webcam-based tests for mobile, so look out for this option.) . | Use tools like SurveyMonkey to conduct quick straw polls. Verify is a good alternative. . | Make sure you can quickly view your wireframes on mobile. We use InVision to rapidly add functionality to our mobile wireframes. Then, we combine the wireframes with screenshots to create a semiworking version of the entire funnel. Finally, we use a service like UserTesting.com to test the prototype funnel. . | We use A/B testing software like Optimizely to measure which page generates the most conversions. Optimizely’s advanced custom audience features came into their own on this project. Tests that would have been prohibitively complex to run were suddenly within reach. . | . A tip for succeeding in highly regulated industries . If, like goHenry, you’re working in financial services&mdash;or any tightly regulated vertical&mdash;you’ll need to work closely with risk and compliance teams. This can be a major bottleneck in getting your ideas approved. Where possible, submit your ideas in “bite-size” chunks, each with a mini-business case. Complexity in these submissions can otherwise be crippling. Such “micro-approvals” are less onerous and much more likely to succeed. . What’s next? . We are now working on the goHenry app itself, aiming to drive engagement and referrals. . On the website, we’re working on the sign-up funnel, as well as other key parts of the journey such as forgotten password and referrals. . Once complete, we will have rebuilt the entire website. . What’s unusual about this rebuild is that it has been done iteratively, and with conversion at the heart of every decision. Conversion, by definition, is the reason that any website exists. . Every new page has been… . driven by visitors and . | measured to make sure it outperforms what went before it. . | . Nine out of every ten redesign projects we see go wrong. Performance and conversion often nosedive, and expensive&mdash;and time-consuming&mdash;remedial action is necessary. (We know this because this is why many clients pick up the phone and call us.) . By adopting the iterative approach we have outlined above, we eliminate the risk. Plus, every new page is ROI-positive from the moment it is pushed live. . What about desktop? . We have deliberately ignored desktop in this section, despite the fact that we’ve worked extensively on goHenry’s desktop website. That’s because optimizing for mobile is just like optimizing for desktop, but with the following additional obstacles: . Mobile users can be more distractible, because they are often on the move or multitasking. . | The connection speed is more likely to be low or intermittent. . | The keyboard is more fiddly to use. . | The screen is much smaller (and smaller still when the keyboard is active). In particular, users can struggle to complete forms. . | The screen is often being viewed in bright light, so low-contrast text and images can be harder to see. . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-48&quot;&gt; Now it’s your turn to win . You now know enough to hugely grow any business. . More importantly, you have a mental model for doing it: . By understanding your visitors, using the techniques we’ve described, you can empathically anticipate what will make them happy. . | And by understanding the key features of winning websites, you can identify your own company’s obstacles, and then fix them so your company is firing on all cylinders. . | .

At the start of this book, we included quotes taken from our website from clients we’ve helped over the last ten years. Here are more inspiring examples . “Conversion Rate Experts were looking for monumental wins, and suggested big changes across our business. They recommended, and helped us to build, what became the second-busiest financial community in the UK.” &mdash;money.co.uk, one of the UK’s most popular financial comparison websites. . “They passed amazing amounts of knowledge off to our team and inspired our team with their enthusiasm and passion for what they do. We’ve even had some product test pages where they’ve converted 100% better than the previous page.” &mdash;Cogeco Peer 1 Hosting, one of the world’s top-five hosting providers, hosting more than one percent of the internet. . “We gained confidence about making big changes because CRE told us that it’s the big changes that would have the big impact.” &mdash;TopCashback, which we have helped to be the fifth-fastest-growing company in the UK, growing sales by 2,600% (that’s 27 times) in three years. . “Each percentage point of conversion is very, very important to us and worth a lot of money. Great fun, great results, great return on investment.” &mdash;888.com, the high-profile gaming website. . “They helped us get our CRO program off the ground. We now have a much deeper understanding of some of the key customer pain points and, more importantly, a well-defined road map on how to address them.” &mdash;Hertz, the car-rental company with locations in 150 countries. . “It was a professional dream come true for me to have worked with them. In some of the places like the top of the funnel, we almost doubled our conversion rates. It’s helped all of us on the team get better at what we do.” &mdash;TINYpulse, an online B2B software platform for engaging employees. . “Conversion rate is the fastest, easiest way to see an increase in your business. The conversion rate was originally less than 5%, and Conversion Rate Experts increased it to 20%&ndash;25%.” &mdash;Voices.com, a leading recruitment platform for voice-over artists, having a user base of over 200,000 individuals and companies. . 363% increase in conversion rate for Crazy Egg, the leading click-mapping platform. “Instead of saying, ‘We want to do this, or we want to do that, or I think this would be best for the business,’ they got data to back up their decisions and they did that. Which is why we had such a substantial lift.” &mdash;Neil Patel, founder. “They focused on understanding our customers. We believe that led to the increase in conversions.” &mdash;Hiten Shah, founder. . 63% increase in sales for Morphsuits, the fancy dress company that became the UK’s 18th fastest growing company. “We know, when we’re thinking about making changes, that anything that they’re suggesting is backed up by the data.” &mdash;Morphsuits . “If you don’t have a solid conversion rate plan, I would definitely advise you to get in touch with Conversion Rate Experts.” &mdash;Dell, the multinational computer technology company. . “Conversion Rate Experts are by far and away the number one in the world. They have helped us transform our business and our processes around testing. As a direct result of working with Conversion Rate Experts, we’ve doubled our revenue.” &mdash;HomeFinder, a leading real-estate website. . “I went into this project fairly skeptical that we’d be able to achieve a 30%+ improvement. At 50%+, it far exceeded our expectations.” &mdash;AAG, America&#39;s largest provider of government-insured reverse mortgages. . “Working with Conversion Rate Experts has been extremely stunning in terms of results. It’s definitely driving a lot of revenue.” &mdash;Xero, the disruptive cloud software company. . “The decision making process is based on real data, tested data, rather than just gut feeling. The results that we’ve achieved have been very impressive.” &mdash;Companies Made Simple, the company formation service that has created over half a million companies. . “The work that we’ve done with Conversion Rate Experts has resulted in additional revenue of around £1 million per year. It’s been a huge learning experience for the entire team. I wish we had done it a lot earlier.” &mdash;Health Express, an online clinic. . “Sales have increased from £16 million to £31 million per year.” &mdash;Sunshine.co.uk, an online travel operator. . “They are brilliant. The results speak for themselves. Sales nearly tripled.” &mdash;Broadband.co.uk, a leading comparison website for broadband services. . “The results have been great.” &mdash;FreestyleXtreme, “Earth&#39;s largest action-sports store.” . “They show you how to increase your conversion rate in a structured, analytical and scientific manner.

CRE understands our pain, our industry, and our visitors’ frustrations. One test alone gave a 44% increase.” &mdash;The Foundry, a visual-effects software company whose clients include Pixar, ILM, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Sony Pictures Imageworks. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops}type=&quot;bodymatter&quot; class=&quot;calibre&quot; id=&quot;calibre_link-14&quot;&gt; Acknowledgements .

    "title": "Navigation Structure",
    "content": "Navigation Structure . . Main navigation | Ordering pages | Excluding pages | Pages with children Child pages | Auto-generating Table of Contents | Children with children | | Auxiliary Navigation | In-page navigation with Table of Contents | . Main navigation . The main navigation for your Just the Docs site is on the left side of the page at large screens and on the top (behind a tap) on small screens. The main navigation can be structured to accommodate a multi-level menu system (pages with children and grandchildren). . By default, all pages will appear as top level pages in the main nav unless a parent page is defined (see Pages with Children). . . Ordering pages . To specify a page order, use the nav_order parameter in your pages’ YAML front matter. . Example . layout: default title: Customization nav_order: 4 . . Excluding pages . For specific pages that you do not wish to include in the main navigation, e.g. a 404 page or a landing page, use the nav_exclude: true parameter in the YAML front matter for that page. . Example . layout: default title: 404 nav_exclude: true . . Pages with children . Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) | |-- docs | |-- ui-components | | |-- index.md (parent page) | | |-- buttons.md | | |-- code.md | | |-- labels.md | | |-- tables.md | | +-- typography.md | | | |-- utilities | | |-- index.md (parent page) | | |-- color.md | | |-- layout.md | | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | | +-- typography.md | | | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. | |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. . On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. . Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). . Example . layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. . Example . layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. . Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | Example . layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true . layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 . This would create the following navigation structure: . +-- .. | |-- UI Components | |-- .. | | | |-- Buttons | | |-- Button Child Page | | | |-- .. | +-- .. . . Auxiliary Navigation . To add a auxiliary navigation item to your site (in the upper right on all pages), add it to the aux_nav configuration option in your site’s _config.yml file. . Example . # Aux links for the upper right navigation aux_links: &quot;Just the Docs on GitHub&quot;: - &quot;//github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs&quot; . . In-page navigation with Table of Contents . To generate a Table of Contents on your docs pages, you can use the {:toc} method from Kramdown, immediately after an &lt;ol&gt; in Markdown. This will automatically generate an ordered list of anchor links to various sections of the page based on headings and heading levels. There may be occasions where you’re using a heading and you don’t want it to show up in the TOC, so to skip a particular heading use the {: .no_toc } CSS class. . Example . # Navigation Structure {: .no_toc } ## {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} . This example skips the page name heading (#) from the TOC, as well as the heading for the Table of Contents itself (##) because it is redundant, followed by the table of contents itself. .",

    "content": "Take Their Money - S . TAKE THEIR MONEY . Kyle Milligan &nbsp; . &nbsp; . Introduction . The Big Message Behind This Book: . Here&rsquo;s the single most important theme and idea for this guide: . Copywriting is a language. . Consider copywriting a &ldquo;professional language,&rdquo; like accounting. . Accounting is considered &ldquo;the language of business.&rdquo; . And copywriting has been referred to as &ldquo;salesmanship in print&hellip;&rdquo; So it makes sense to consider copywriting the &ldquo;language of sales.&rdquo; More specifically, it is the language of emotion. . Because emotions are what make people buy things. . For me, it has been effective to learn copywriting the way you&rsquo;d learn a new language, say Spanish. . (For the purposes of this book, assume you absolutely cannot read or speak any Spanish. . It will make all my examples a lot easier) . If you&rsquo;ve never tried to learn a new language, here&rsquo;s how the education process usually goes&hellip; . The instructors will start with some basics&hellip; . Then they will add some stuff on top, while they continue to repeat and reinforce past lessons and basics over and over. . It is the brute force repetition that makes the language stick. . But nobody teaches copywriting as a language to practice. . Instead they teach it like putting together a piece of furniture. . &ldquo;Do this. . Then do that. . Fill in this template.&rdquo; . We will not do that inside this guide. . We will establish a few core principles, then expand on them over and over and over. . In fact, you may find parts of this guide repetitive. . That is by design. . Once the emotions of the copywriting language are DRILLED into your memory through continuous practice and repetition... . Then you really just need to consume as much of the language as possible. . Soon you&rsquo;ll start to recognize patterns&hellip; . And then what started as reciting your &ldquo;ABC&rsquo;s&rdquo; and numbers &ldquo;one through ten&rdquo; will evolve into simple objects, then simple sentences&hellip; . Until you are ordering your own food at a restaurant and telling jokes in &ldquo;Spanish.&rdquo; This guide will help you develop skills in a similar way for copywriting. . At first you will need to think about what you are doing&hellip; . But not for long. . In no time it will all be second nature. . Most Gurus Only Get You Halfway There . Imagine if instead of teaching you Spanish, I just gave you some of the most common phrases Spanish people say and told you to &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; for whatever you need. . That&rsquo;s what a lot of &ldquo;copywriting training&rdquo; has become. . Email templates, headline templates&hellip; . Garbage. . And sometimes gurus accidentally teach copywriting concepts without realizing that they are really speaking in jargon that comes loaded with assumptions that were never explained! . That&rsquo;s because from the outside, it looks like gurus are speaking in simple English when they teach&hellip; . That&rsquo;s the deception of copywriting&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; appearance. . For example, they say you should write &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; when you write your copy. . But your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come automatically imbued with salesmanship&hellip; . That is, your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t automatically create intrigue&hellip; . Or automatically present a new and novel idea&hellip; . Or automatically communicate a sense of safety, ease, or urgency or scarcity! You see, the language of copywriting is found in the subtext, not the text. . Copywriting is an emotional language where the words on the page do not matter as much as you&rsquo;d think! . Because the emotional part of the brain is triggered by the unwritten subtext. . The subtext is inferred, not spoken. . Put another way, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.&rdquo; . If your words are conversational, but don&rsquo;t communicate important, specific subtext, then you are speaking English&hellip; . NOT copywriting. . If this sounds complicated, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; . This guide is designed specifically to clear all of that up for you. . And it will also offer you all the tools you need to master the language of copywriting. . What&rsquo;s important is if you have been buying tons of books and courses only to find that your copywriting skills haven&rsquo;t improved&hellip; . It&rsquo;s not your fault. . Nobody teaches this subject as what it is... . A unique language of its own that requires continuous practice. . Why Templates And Regular Copywriting Books Fail You . So back to our Spanish example. . Say you&rsquo;re ordering food at a restaurant. . The server is speaking only in Spanish. . You need help. . Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m there too, and I tell you exactly what to say to the server. . You repeat what I taught you perfectly! . Should you be happy? . You&rsquo;re probably not satisfied. . Because when you really think about it&hellip; . You only have the ability to say those couple words in that specific context, to that specific person, at that specific moment in time. . And even though you recognized a few of the sounds from Spanish books you&rsquo;ve read, you still don&rsquo;t really understand what you or the server said in the first place&hellip; . And here&rsquo;s the real kicker&hellip; . You have no concept or system to help you understand HOW I decided to say what I said, instead of&nbsp;saying something completely different... . Sure, the words made sense after you heard them&hellip; . But how can you come up with them? . That&rsquo;s the problem with reading regular copywriting books and following templates. . You KNOW that you are supposed to grab attention. . You KNOW that you are supposed to build intrigue. . You KNOW that you need to create urgency&hellip; . BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY?!?!?!?!?! . How the hell do you make this influence trigger&hellip; . TRIGGER?! . So if you&rsquo;ve read a bunch of copywriting books and still lack total and complete confidence in your copywriting, now you know why. . It&rsquo;s not your fault. . This book is going change that for you, once and for all. . Becoming A Great Copywriter - The Daily Practice . To become a great copywriter, and to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting, there are three things you must do. . I am &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; this checklist from Joe Schriefer, the publisher at Agora Financial and all around awesome dude. . The Daily Practice: . Read a piece of copy a day | Write a page of copy a day | Come up with an idea a day | Read a Piece of Copy a Day . When you read a piece of copy, you should practice &ldquo;active reading.&rdquo; Passive reading is what the majority of people do when they read. . The passive reader just absorbs the material and questions nothing within. . Your task as an active reader is to tease out subtext and try to infer the writer&rsquo;s purpose behind what was written. . This entire guide is dedicated to teaching you professional level active reading skills. . Write a Page of Copy A Day . Writing a page of copy a day isn&rsquo;t as daunting as it sounds. . Simply write a page of copy. . It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for a big project, though it can be. . It could be a series of five short emails that you sum up into one page. . And you don&rsquo;t have to use this page of copy you wrote. . If you want, you can throw your page away after you write it. . You could also just hand-copy a page of copy from a successful copywriter. . Sometimes I do that, then active read and mark up what I wrote. . Don&rsquo;t get too hung up on this stuff. . The benefit is in the daily practice and engagement with the language of copywriting. . Come Up With An Idea A Day . When coming up with an idea a day, you should not be hunting for a &ldquo;big idea.&rdquo; For instance, your one idea could be a simple way to improve a sales process&hellip; . A cool subject line for an email&hellip; . It could be anything, really. . Just try to stay in the habit of asking &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo; as often as possible. . I know you&rsquo;ll easily check this item off every day&hellip; . Everything in this guide will open your eyes and mind to a brand-new way of perceiving everything you read&hellip; . Particularly text within advertising and marketing materials. . So you will have plenty of ideas. . Of this I&rsquo;m sure. . What You Should Expect From This Guide&hellip; . The purpose of this guide is to give you the tools you need to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting and expedite your progress towards mastery over the language. . In this guide we will move through the common components of a full, long-form direct response sales letter. . We will cover the subtext that must be communicated by the copywriter, with examples of how some of the best copywriters in the world do it. . The lessons will build on each other, so easy to grasp patterns will emerge quickly for you. . Before we cover the different sections of copy, I need to explain how to active read&hellip; . Without knowing what to look for and how to perform active reading, the rest of this guide is worthless. . Active Reading- What To Look For When Reading A Piece of Copy . Copywriting is a language . Copywriting is a language communicated purely through subtext. . Therefore, when you are reading copy you are not looking for clever turns of phrase or &ldquo;mind control lines.&rdquo; . The words aren&rsquo;t important. . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . When reading a piece of copy, you are looking for what the copywriter is actually trying to communicate. . How I Discovered the Language . You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that everything I&rsquo;m going to show you in this guide already helped me generate well over $7.1 million in sales in a single year as a copywriter at Agora Financial. . And don&rsquo;t think for a minute that I had a clue what I was doing when I got hired. . I probably knew less about copywriting than you know now. . I was as green as they come. . But I was eager to learn copywriting fast so I could make a million bucks, so I asked this question on my first day: . &ldquo;What books should I read? I&rsquo;ve read The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert and The Ultimate Sales Letter by Dan Kennedy&hellip; . What else?&rdquo; . The reply: . &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to read any of that stuff&hellip; . Don&rsquo;t read about copy. . Just read copy.&rdquo; That was a disappointing answer for me at the time&hellip; . But it has turned out to be the most fundamental truth about learning copywriting fast&hellip; . And the most important step to becoming a great copywriter. . Lesson: . If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about Spanish&hellip; . Simply read Spanish. . And if you want to learn how to speak copywriting, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about copywriting&hellip; . Just read copywriting. . The fastest way to normalize the language of copywriting, and internalize it in your brain, is to read it every single day. . &ldquo;Actively&rdquo; Read a Piece of Copy a Day . It&rsquo;s not good enough to simply read a piece of copy every day. . You must practice active reading. . That is, you read with purpose. . You&rsquo;ll read with pen in hand, discovering and marking patterns that will make writing your own copy much, much easier... . And you&rsquo;ll look for new and novel lines the writer used that will inspire new, original ideas for when you&rsquo;re writing your own copy. . This guide is going to give you the tools to perform active reading like a champ. . It&rsquo;s All About The Patterns&hellip; . Since I work in direct response and typically write long-form sales letters, that&rsquo;s where our focus will be. . But don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; . Even if you don&rsquo;t write long-form sales letters, you can rest assured that the emotions you will learn in just a moment will make you great at any style or length of copywriting. . Because this guide is not designed to tell you WHAT to write. . Instead you&rsquo;ll learn how to speak the language itself&hellip; . This guide will shine a light on the secret patterns of the copywriting language, and soon they will be second nature to you. . I can&rsquo;t stress enough: . Recognizing patterns is one of the most critical lessons of reading copywriting daily. . Binging Copywriting And The Walking Dead . So here&rsquo;s an example&hellip; . I used to love watching &ldquo;The Walking Dead.&rdquo; Until I binged a season or two in a matter of days. . Then I could predict almost exactly when the zombies would appear&hellip; . And I knew the elements that would lead right up to the characters becoming trapped and then narrowly escaping. . I picked up on cues in the directing that gave away what was coming because the set ups were always so similar. . In fact, after binging two seasons, I felt like I could write an episode myself. . Opening scene&hellip; . So and so is injured or incapacitated in some way&hellip; . we need supplies / or a specific rare item&hellip; . Go on supply run&hellip; . everything is fine&hellip; . supply run goes bad/some idiot makes a loud noise&hellip; . Zombies appear out of nowhere&hellip; . roof falls in&hellip; . heroes are overwhelmed by army of zombies suddenly&hellip; . Someone gets grabbed&hellip; . they almost get bit&hellip; . they narrowly escape. . You just change the characters and locations&hellip; . And with some limited exceptions, the chain of events I just described appeared in similar fashion regularly in the show (from what I remember). . And it isn&rsquo;t that The Walking Dead creators aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;clever&rdquo; enough. . They knew exactly how to speak to their viewers&rsquo; emotions and captivate their audience. . That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the show is so successful. . But it&rsquo;s also why some regular patterns emerged. . You want to expedite your ability to recognize and deconstruct those types of patterns in copywriting. . The language of copywriting is designed for one function: to speak directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions&hellip; . So the sooner you can recognize the patterns within the language, the sooner YOU can manipulate those patterns to do the same yourself. . If I wanted to write my own episode of The Walking Dead I&rsquo;d binge episodes of The Walking Dead and copy what works. . Same thing with copywriting. . Once you &ldquo;binge&rdquo; enough copy, it takes the work out of writing it. . The words will flow from you naturally. . You&rsquo;ll just know what should come next. . As some folks put it, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . Before You Can Ever Perform Active Reading . Unfortunately, you cannot simply binge copywriting and recognize the patterns. . It won&rsquo;t work. . Remember, copywriting is a completely foreign language... . It is the hidden subtext that speaks directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions. . You can&rsquo;t just read the words and pick it up. . The critical reading skills you learned in school won&rsquo;t help you here. . So humble yourself now&hellip; . Do not think because copy is written in simple, basic, English words that it can be understood via traditional reading comprehension. . Without a decoder like this guide, binging copywriting would be like trying to read a million Spanish novels without some way to translate. . Even if you binge read all the Spanish novels in the world, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand anything more about the language without a way to translate it. . And you would be no closer to your goal of speaking Spanish fluently. . Important: . Binging is critical to learning and recognizing patterns. . But binging a foreign language is useless without a decoder. . This guide will serve as your decoder, unlocking your ability to binge copywriting and thus pick up the language rapidly. . | . Copywriting. Must. Be. Translated. . There is a TON going on &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; in copy. . Smoke and mirrors stuff. . You think you are reading one thing&hellip; . but you really are not. . And often, if you aren&rsquo;t very specifically searching and actively reading&hellip; . You may totally overlook a sales trigger or persuasion tactic that is subliminally being planted. . Active reading allows you to break down a piece of copy and pull out those tricks. . Active reading is a &ldquo;translator&rdquo; for teasing the subliminal subtext (i.e. . the REAL messages) out of the copy. . &nbsp; . &ldquo;The Big 4&rdquo; &ndash; The Subtext Beneath All Copywriting . In just a moment we will go deeper into active reading and dive into the different sections of copy&hellip; . But first, you must understand four crucial emotions and how they operate within a work of copy. . Because these four emotions are present in the entire body of copy&hellip; . From the first word of the headline, down to last word in the P.S.. . Every word of copywriting is specifically designed and choreographed to serve what I call: The &ldquo;The Big 4.&rdquo; . Basically, in great copy there are four main sentiments or emotions you want to trigger in your reader&rsquo;s mind&hellip; . These 4 do that&hellip; . Or &ldquo;are&rdquo; that. . And each of The Big 4 comes in a pair. . Think of each item as having an &ldquo;alter ego.&rdquo; . The alter ego is similar to the original emotion, but dressed up and comes with super powers. . Like Clark Kent and Superman. . Or Peter Parker and Spider-Man if you prefer Marvel (I do)&hellip; . Anyways, you get it. . When applied correctly, alter egos can function as persuasion multipliers, or &ldquo;amplifiers.&rdquo; I know, this might sound complicated, but trust me, it&rsquo;s really simple. . I promise. . Look&hellip; . Here are The Big 4: . New | Easy | Safe | Big | . And here they are with their alter egos attached: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast | . NESB . A quick and easy mnemonic device you can use to recall the Big 4 is NESB (nes-bee). . Let&rsquo;s dive into these, because they are the gas that drives every word of the copywriting machine. . The Big 4 are the subtext overlooked while regular people are reading copy with their&hellip; regular eyes. . I hope you&rsquo;re excited&hellip; . This is your first step into translating the incredible and powerful language of copywriting. . New . New is the single most important emotion to drive a successful piece of copy. . People are highly skeptical of advertising and they have very short attention spans. . The most direct way to combat their fickle attention is to put something &ldquo;new and novel&rdquo; in front of them. . It must be something they&rsquo;ve truly never seen before... . Or they will walk away from your pitch before you can even make it. . To frame how important &ldquo;New&rdquo; is&hellip; . Just remember this phrase: &ldquo;categorization is DEATH.&rdquo; . If the reader ever feels they can label your message as something they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;seen before&hellip;&rdquo; . Or even label your message as SIMILAR to something they&rsquo;ve seen before&hellip; . They think: “This is just like that thing I saw yesterday…” . Then you and your copy are DEAD. . BURIED. . Treat &ldquo;New&rdquo; with that level of mortal seriousness. . I&rsquo;m serious. . I cannot stress this enough. . Your reader must never be able to say, &ldquo;I know exactly what this is, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo; Copywriting speaks directly toward the emotional center of the brain. . The &ldquo;lizard brain&rdquo; as some call it. . And that is the most fickle and lazy part of the brain. . It does NOT want to spend any effort on attention. . The lizard brain wants to quickly categorize anything that crosses its path as either a threat, something to eat, or something to ignore. . That way it can go back to doing nothing. . Do NOT let the lizard brain categorize your copywriting as something to ignore. . You combat that by weaving New into the subtext of your copywriting. . This guide will purposefully not offer you &ldquo;step 1, 2, 3,&rdquo; to accomplish this. . This guide will not tell you what to write. . Remember, this guide is your translator&hellip; . It will help you recognize the patterns hidden in the subtext of the words that you once thought were just regular words. . And now you know about this one, single emotion, &ldquo;New&hellip;&rdquo; . You will now see the following words POP out at your face and smack you in the eye balls when you look at copy&hellip; . Breakthrough | Revolutionary | Discovery | Game Changing | Disruptive | NEW | Announcing | Revealed | Breaking | . You&rsquo;ve probably seen these words listed as &ldquo;power words&rdquo; in a blog post before. . But what is their power? What does it matter? . They convey &ldquo;New&rdquo;. . They tell the lizard brain, &ldquo;Hey, ya bastard. . You can&rsquo;t categorize and ignore me. . I&rsquo;ve gotcha.&rdquo; . And now your brain will automatically translate these &ldquo;regular words&rdquo; for what they really mean&hellip; . The subtext they really convey&hellip; . And you will immediately understand their true purpose in copywriting. . They tell the reader, &ldquo;You actually have NOT seen this before. . Keep reading to discover what it is&hellip;&rdquo; Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll understand what the copywriter who wrote them understands&hellip; . &ldquo;Categorization is DEATH.&rdquo; . If something is breakthrough, it is new. . If it is revolutionary&hellip; . It is new. . If it is a game changer&hellip; . it is new. . Again, all these words convey, &ldquo;You do not know what this is because it is brand new.&rdquo; . Why Is &ldquo;New&rdquo; So Important? . We&rsquo;re going to go just a little deeper than I planned&hellip; . But I think this is very, very important. . This touches on the psychology of the reader. . If you are offering a widget to a reader, you are offering them some sort of &ldquo;value.&rdquo; The &ldquo;value&rdquo; is that your widget solves a problem or provides some benefit. . Basic stuff, right? . And that&rsquo;s where many copywriting guides might stop, but not this one... . If you are selling a problem solver widget, chances are your reader has had this problem for a while&hellip; . And what&rsquo;s worse&hellip; . Nothing has ever worked for them before. . They&rsquo;ve probably bought a widget for this problem before, and it failed them. . So they still have the problem&hellip; . They are now keenly aware and averse to what doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip; . And they are still looking for that magic bullet / magic pill / one secret that will finally solve their problem. . If you put the &ldquo;same&rdquo; solution that they&rsquo;ve seen before, they KNOW there is no hope that it will work. . They have tried that. . And they assume that to indulge in reading your copy will just result in more disappointment. . So they won&rsquo;t waste their time. . But if the copy conveys this is BRAND NEW, then there is hope for them. . This could be the thing. . This could finally be it. . Finally, the solution to their problems. . Something new = hope. . So the emotion of New isn&rsquo;t just about holding attention to learn what the new thing is. . Many beginner copywriters believe intrigue alone will propel readers to continue reading. . But that&rsquo;s not New&rsquo;s true purpose. . New isn&rsquo;t just a set of &ldquo;power words.&rdquo; . Even though New does hold attention, and New does have power&hellip; . It&rsquo;s power comes from one thing NOBODY talks about&hellip; . New offers &ldquo;hope.&rdquo; . Hope that finally, the one thing that they have been searching for is in front of them. . New and Novel . One more thing on the topic of New&hellip; . New is NEW and NOVEL. . New is NOT just a &ldquo;better version of xyz.&rdquo; Do not get the two confused. . As the famous copywriter, Ryan McGrath, taught me at Agora Financial: New and different is better than &ldquo;better.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s a couple lines of real life copywriting that demonstrate New&hellip; . Dear Reader, . Hello, I&#39;m Dr. Kent Moors. . I&#39;m reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history... . And the last time was more than a century ago. . The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now... . - . This excerpt is from a sales letter by Money Map Press. . The headline is: . Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker . I&rsquo;ve dissected this promo on my YouTube. . Since you&rsquo;re probably reading this as a digital copy, I&rsquo;ll give you the URL to that YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/Fv7zwDItHlk . Copy and paste that link and you can see me dissect the entire sales letter for free. . Also, you can have access to my entire swipe file with my notes in the margins by going to: http://kylethewriter.com/swipe . I don&rsquo;t want to make sales pitches inside a book you paid money for, but I thought you might be interested in these free resources. . Any copywriting I use as an example in this book will be available through my swipe file link. . | . Sound like something you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;heard before?&rdquo; Probably not. . This is a &ldquo;world-changing new liquid.&rdquo; New. . New&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Only&rdquo; . Only is a very simple emotion to grasp&hellip; . You can &ldquo;Only get this solution here, through me, on this page.&rdquo; . To say you can only get something on this page means&hellip; . &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t bought this before on this page, then you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; To say you can only get something through me, means it is unique and proprietary to me. . So the subtext is, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t sell you this thing, you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; These ideas convey the same sentiment as &ldquo;New.&rdquo; . Which, again, is: &ldquo;this is different.&rdquo; But more powerfully. . Only amplifies New. . New is Peter Parker and Only is Spider-Man. . Got it? . Here are some key words that should jump out and let you know the subtext of the copywriting is communicating the Only emotion: . Exclusive | Patented | Only here | Proprietary | . You&rsquo;ll be able to automatically translate these words for what they really mean&hellip; . Because you understand that these are not just &ldquo;power words&hellip;&rdquo; . But that these words convey the benefit of exclusiveness&hellip; . They convey New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . Nothing is as important as New. . New is the source of hope. . Tap into that, and you have already won. . Here&rsquo;s an example of Only taken from my first front-end promo I wrote for James Altucher and his service, The Altucher Report, at Agora Financial. . The promo was called, The Hottest IPO. . Dear Reader, . See this document I&rsquo;m holding in my hand? It&rsquo;s called The Pre-IPO Prospectus. . It&rsquo;s the only document in the world that contains details of a pre-IPO strategy that could help you make a fortune from this private company&rsquo;s explosive growth&hellip; . BEFORE it goes public! . | . Right away we establish that this is a brand New opportunity that is Only available through us! . Easy . Nobody likes work. . If they did, everyone you knew when you were little and at school would be massively successful and rich today. . If for some reason I can&rsquo;t get you to totally believe that nobody likes work, then let&rsquo;s compromise at this: Anybody who loves work is not reading your copy. . They&rsquo;re working. . Okay, now you know copywriters only need to concern themselves with writing to people who want an easy, &ldquo;work-free&rdquo; solution to their problems&hellip; . You can easily grasp the Easy emotion. . Folks want a push-button solution. . Or they want the &ldquo;single, simple trick to 10x their results.&rdquo; There are two reasons for this: . They are lazy | They are insecure | Lazy . The first one is obvious, and probably the first thought that came to your mind immediately. . You can reduce a reader&rsquo;s &ldquo;workload&rdquo; and play into their laziness by making the solution take very little time&hellip; . &ldquo;Six minute abs.&rdquo; . Or by creating a system&hellip; . Or step-by-step solution&hellip; . Or by making it push-button&hellip; . The second reason, they are insecure, goes a little deeper into psychology. . Insecure . You see, like the New emotion, there is a chance that your prospect has tried something similar to what you&rsquo;re offering now&hellip; . And it failed them. . Maybe they blamed the products they bought. . But maybe, at a deeper level, they blamed themselves. . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not smart enough.&rdquo; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich enough.&rdquo; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too ugly, too short, too fat, too bald, too oily, too weak&hellip;&rdquo; . So a writer can multiply the effect of Easy by making things easy enough that Anybody can do it. . And that is where Easy&rsquo;s alter ego comes in. . Easy&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Anybody&rdquo; . When you convey that &ldquo;anybody can do xyz,&rdquo; you are conveying that the process has been dumbed down for the lowest common denominator. . Even though people may think they are bad at something, they never believe that they are the dumbest or worst person on the planet. . So you can quickly and easily convey that something is easy enough for them&hellip; . Despite their insecurities and shortcomings&hellip; . By conveying that it is so fool-proof that Anybody can use this solution and still get incredible results. . This leads us to what are known as &ldquo;Not Statements.&rdquo; . Not Statements . Not statements have two uses. . Build intrigue | Convey Easy/Anybody | The first use of Not Statements is to build intrigue. . Use this when your reader might THINK they know what you&rsquo;re talking about already, but then you say&hellip; . &ldquo;I can easily help you get abs in 6 days with this breakthrough technique&hellip; . It&rsquo;s not muscle confusion. . It&rsquo;s not power lifting. . And it&rsquo;s not cardio&hellip;&rdquo; . You want your reader left thinking, &ldquo;Well shit&hellip; . What is it?!&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s the intrigue side of Not Statements. . The other primary use of Not Statements is to directly employ the Easy / Anybody emotions&hellip; . &ldquo;You can earn $1,000 a week in passive income starting next Monday&hellip; . And you don&rsquo;t have to be a financial genius, or even have finished high school. . You don&rsquo;t have to have any coding or web experience, you could get started in the next five minutes with nothing but an internet connection. . And you don&rsquo;t have to have a lot money&hellip; . all you need is $10!&rdquo; . What not statements do in this context is provide the reader with the certainty that the solution is not too difficult for them. . In other words, the reader doesn&rsquo;t have to do any real work and they are already over-qualified. . Now when you read copywriting, I expect the REAL meaning behind the following words and phrases to POP out at you&hellip; . Easy | Anybody | Simple | 1, 2, 3 | Push-button | Automatic | Fool-proof | Step-by-step | System | All you have to do is&hellip; | All you needed to do&hellip; | Simply follow the steps&hellip; | Not statements | You don&rsquo;t need&hellip; | . Now you know that the copywriter is pushing the Easy/Anybody emotion into action. . &ldquo;This solution will not require work from you&hellip; . And it is not too complicated to be beyond your reach. . You can do this.&rdquo; . Easy. . Here&rsquo;s an example of Easy at play in Money Map&rsquo;s promo for &ldquo;The Money Zone.&rdquo; . Now you&rsquo;re $7,800 richer over a three-week period, all because the S&amp;P 500 went in the direction it was expected to. . And again, all you needed to do was place a middleman trade. . To do this you would have to place a special and very obscure options play on the S&amp;P, which as you know is not a stock but rather the heartbeat of the market itself. . To me this is easy money. . It doesn&rsquo;t get any easier than this. . | . The copywriter directly states that THIS IS EASY. . Below is an example of &ldquo;Not Statements&rdquo; from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . But in just a few minutes you could be one of the lucky few who will get their hands on The Pre-IPO Prospectus&hellip; . Inside this independent research document, you&rsquo;ll learn all the details of this exciting project&hellip; . And see how you can invest in the groundbreaking technology behind it&hellip; . BEFORE this startup goes public. . You don&rsquo;t have to be an accredited investor or have a lot of money. . You don&rsquo;t have to be a stock expert&hellip; . Or even have any investing experience at all. . But you need to act fast&hellip; . I expect by the end of the day all the 945 Pre-IPO Prospectuses I have will be gone. . | . In this copy, I&rsquo;m taking the most common hurdles a reader might bring up immediately and knocking them out line by line. . I&rsquo;m letting them know: &ldquo;Anybody can do this&hellip;&rdquo; . Safe . To capture attention, copywriters are forced to put some pretty bold promises in front of their readers. . Unfortunately, what the copywriters gain in attention with bold promises also comes handcuffed to additional skepticism. . To state the obvious, skepticism makes a copywriter&rsquo;s job more difficult&hellip; . But a smart copywriter can fight that skepticism with the right tools. . But before we get into those&hellip; . A Hidden Benefit of Safe . Employing the Safe emotion will combat reader skepticism&hellip; . And it will also make your offer more appear more VALUABLE to your reader. . Psychology studies have shown that when people consider something &ldquo;risky,&rdquo; they also judge that thing&rsquo;s benefits as less valuable. . Conversely, when folks deem something as &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; they automatically attribute higher value to that thing&rsquo;s benefits. . This might feel counterintuitive to the real world, where higher risk usually comes tied to higher potential rewards, but copywriters are not selling to logical beings&hellip; . They are selling to people. . So knowing what we know about irrational people, the Safe emotion serves two goals: . It makes the reader less skeptical about your offer, thereby making the reader more open to the idea of buying | By reducing risk, Safe automatically increases the reader&rsquo;s perceived value of your offer, because studies have shown that things people perceive as &ldquo;less risky&rdquo; are perceived as &ldquo;more valuable&rdquo; | That makes Safe a very powerful emotion. . And since it has two benefits, it has exponential returns for copywriters! . Risk Aversion . Studies have shown that people are risk averse. . Risk averse basically means people would rather avoid a loss than pursue a gain. . This is sort of common knowledge in the persuasion community. . But what does that mean for us, practically as copywriters? What does that mean for our Big 4 emotions? . The best way to understand it is to view an example from a real psychology study&hellip; . A set of subjects had two choices. . Choice one, they could take &ldquo;a gamble.&rdquo; . The gamble option was an 80% chance to win $100 with a 20% chance to win $10. . To help you visualize what that means&hellip; . Imagine the gamble option as a scratch-off lottery ticket with 10 squares. . Eight squares are worth $100 and two squares are worth $10. . But you can only scratch one square. . Okay, got that visual? . Good. . The other choice people had besides the gamble option was a sure thing of $80, guaranteed. . The results? . Most people take the $80. . Mathematically, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. . A statistician would tell you the value of the gamble was $82. . $100 X .8 + $10 *.2 = $82. . Logically, the gamble is worth more. . But we aren&rsquo;t dealing with logical beings. . We are dealing with people. . And even if you aren&rsquo;t a math whiz, turning down an 80% chance at $100 is a tough option to turn down. . Especially when the lowest possible outcome was to still win $10&hellip; . UNLESS you are a human being who places incredible value on CERTAINTY. . Fact is, most people in this experiment would rather &ldquo;pay a premium&rdquo; or &ldquo;take a discounted payout&rdquo; in exchange for CERTAINTY. . Even though an 80% chance at $100 is pretty damn good odds. . People would rather sacrifice 20 potential dollars and take a guaranteed $80. . Just because it&rsquo;s Safe. . Even though the worst-case scenario came in at a minority 20% chance&hellip; . Folks totally threw out the logical, and more attractive offer of an 80% shot at a better payout of $100. . What does this mean for you, as a copywriter? . It means your reader is very much invested in eliminating as much risk as possible. . Remember when we said the Safe emotion increases PERCEIVED value of your offer? Here&rsquo;s your proof&hellip; . Given two valuable options, people would prefer the LESS VALUABLE option ($80 instead of $100)&hellip; . As long as it is LESS RISKY (100% vs 80% chance). . They perceive the more Safe option as more desirable, even though it is in fact, less valuable. . Just to feel that sense of Safe. . Safe&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . There&rsquo;s a powerful way to jack up the level of Safe a reader feels. . If a copywriter can convey that something follows a Predictable pattern&hellip; . That the opportunity follows in-step with something similar that has happened before&hellip; . Or that this opportunity or its benefits are &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; then readers will perceive that thing as even more &ldquo;Safe.&rdquo; . Showing patterns inside credibility, track record, testimonials, case studies, success stories, etc., demonstrates that &ldquo;xyz result&rdquo; is more &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . The subtext conveyed is that the last time something like &ldquo;A&rdquo; happened in history, &ldquo;B&rdquo; was the result. . Made Up Example: . &ldquo;In 2005, Company A&rsquo;s stock dropped 800 points and then Company A hired CEO Frank. . Then investors in Company A made 10 million dollars in 48 hours. . Today, Company B&rsquo;s stock has just dropped 800 points and guess who they hired as CEO&hellip;? That&rsquo;s right, CEO Frank. . You already know what&rsquo;s bound to happen next for Company B&rsquo;s investors in just a matter of time. . | . If you can set up the pattern to be obvious&hellip; . And then let the READER predict or infer what will happen next like in the made up example above&hellip; . Then the reader is actually SELLING THEMSELVES on the opportunity. . So that was just one made up example. . I&rsquo;ll once again remind you that the words you choose are not as important as the subtext they convey. . That&rsquo;s why this guide does not say, &ldquo;write copy this way.&rdquo; . You write whatever words help you convey Safe and Predictable. . And now that you understand the emotion of Safe and its alter ego Predictable&hellip; . You can automatically translate the following words and phrases when you see them for what they really mean: &ldquo;This is Safe, therefore it is exceptionally beneficial and valuable.&rdquo; . Happened before | Predictable | Safe | History is repeating itself | Just like we&rsquo;ve seen before | Again | The last time this happened&hellip; | . We can see an example of Safe using the SAME copywriting example we used for Easy. . Here&rsquo;s that clip again from The Money Zone&hellip; . Now you&rsquo;re $7,800 richer over a three-week period, all because the S&amp;P 500 went in the direction it was expected to. . And again, all you needed to do was place a middleman trade. . To do this you would have to place a special and very obscure options play on the S&amp;P, which as you know is not a stock but rather the heartbeat of the market itself. . To me this is easy money. . It doesn&#3387;t get any easier than this. . Is there risk? Sure, whenever you&rsquo;re dealing with the markets&hellip; . You can always lose. . As I told you just minutes ago&hellip; . The master algorithm knows &ndash; with 93% certainty &ndash; which direction the S&amp;P is going in (one week in advance)&hellip; . But if the S&amp;P doesn&rsquo;t go in that direction over the following week, it won&rsquo;t enter the Money Zone, and you won&rsquo;t get paid. . | . Notice the copywriter actually gave the level of Safe a numerical value&hellip; 93% certainty. . How Predictable is this benefit? 93%. . This is a great time to explain why the writer would not WANT to claim 100% certainty&hellip; . A 100% claim in the stock market is simply unbelievable. . The entire world would be turned upside down if one person could figure out how to never miss a single opportunity in the stock market. . Everybody in the world would be breaking down doors to get that solution and its value would clearly be infinity dollars, since you could never lose money. . Therefore, a 100% certainty claim would actually create more skepticism, not less. . It&rsquo;s up to you to draw that line in your copy, depending on your niche and product offering. . I will mention I have seen a &ldquo;type&rdquo; of 100% claim in financial copywriting before. . In Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heatseekers&rdquo; promo&hellip; . The headline read: . . Using the track record in this way infers Safe and Predictable without guaranteeing it. . Big . Big generally refers to the size of the opportunity at hand. . This emotion communicates that the opportunity in front of the reader is extremely important, groundbreaking, and rewarding. . Big is probably the most abstract emotion of the four. . It can take many forms &ndash; but it can also be directly stated in copy. . Also, the other three emotions can directly feed into Big... . If something is New, it could be disruptive. . A disruption is usually Big. . &ldquo;The last time something like this happened, it was extremely disruptive&hellip;&rdquo; . That also weaves Predictability in the mix, since we infer we have seen something similar when we say &ldquo;the last time.&rdquo; . (That&rsquo;s pretty cool, huh? Soon you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up on these patterns as you binge copywriting). . A writer can weave Easy into Big by saying something like: . “This is so easy you’ll never trade stocks the same way again.” . So you see, the emotions can work in harmony. . Big is important, because it demands attention. . It infers change, and that is usually why someone reads your copy&hellip; . Because they want a change. . And Big works especially well when coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO). . Fear of Missing Out . Big lends itself easily to FOMO. . For example&hellip; . &ldquo;Do you want to miss out on the chance to invest in the next Google/Amazon/Facebook? Because that&rsquo;s how much money is at stake&hellip;&rdquo; . The reader might feel: &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty big. . I should pay attention.&rdquo; . Big&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; . It is important that the reader feel like they are standing at the foot of a mountain of opportunity. . This single thing can improve your life 10,000%.&rdquo; . The only thing better than something that big&hellip; . &ldquo;This single thing can improve your life 10,000% overnight&hellip;&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s great to see your money grow 10,000%... . To see your strength improve 10,000%... . To see your skin look 10,000% silkier and younge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . But what&rsquo;s better than those Big changes? . All &nbsp;of that stuff in a matter of seconds, minutes, days&hellip; . Not years. . So Fast multiplies the Big of your offer. . Knowing this, you can automatically translate the following phrases&hellip; . Big | Fast | Monster | Huge | Once in a lifetime | Quickly | Overnight | Weekly | . You&rsquo;ll know that Big commands attention&hellip; . It triggers FOMO&hellip; . And the only thing better than Big is getting something Big NOW. . Big AND Fast. . Here&rsquo;s an example of some real copywriting that demonstrates Big and Fast from The Hottest IPO promo&hellip; . And when it comes to growth, nobody comes even close to this startup&hellip; . That&rsquo;s why tech magazine Inc. . says: . &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quite Possibly the Fastest-Growing Private Company Ever&rdquo; . Business Insider calls it &ldquo;the most valuable startup in the U.S. . and across the globe.&rdquo; . And Time magazine called it &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing startup&rdquo; and &ldquo;the defining technology success story of this era.&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s growing faster than Google&hellip; . It&rsquo;s growing three times FASTER than Facebook. . It&rsquo;s growing even faster than Amazon. . And we know these companies all made a lot of people overnight millionaires. . In fact &mdash; Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon himself, says if you had invested in Amazon before it went public, you would have made 70,000 times your money! . Meaning a measly $1,000 investment could have turned into $70 million. . But you HAD to get in position before the IPO. . Because look at Amazon now. . It trades at over $1,000 per share! . In order to just make two times your money, that sucker would have to go up ONE THOUSAND dollars more! . That could take around, oh let&rsquo;s see&hellip; . an entire century. . But if you had been among the lucky few investors who moved fast, before Amazon went public&hellip; . You&rsquo;d be set for life. . Taking orders from nobody. . Enjoying the perks of what some people would call &ldquo;F-U money&rdquo;. . Like I said, the private company I&rsquo;m sharing with you today is growing even faster than Amazon. . It has poured billions into some accredited investors&rsquo; accounts already. . That&rsquo;s why&hellip; . You Need to Act Fast&hellip; . Because Silicon Valley Insiders Are Getting Rich With Each Passing Day . | . Notice how all the elements come together in this passage... . It&rsquo;s BIG, worth millions. . It&rsquo;s growing FASTER than the Biggest companies. . And OTHER PEOPLE are already getting rich (FOMO). . I&rsquo;ll give you one more example of Big and Fast&hellip; . This one from that same Money Map promo I used earlier about the new liquid. . Except this time, specifically pay attention to the &ldquo;Bigness.&rdquo; . Dear Reader, . Hello, I&#39;m Dr. Kent Moors. . I&#39;m reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history... . And the last time was more than a century ago. . The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now... . Even as you read this, these trucks are rolling out of a small American company&#39;s nondescript &ndash; yet highly secure &ndash; production facility in the Midwest. . Why all the secrecy and security? . I&#39;ll explain that fully in just a moment. . But the crux of it is that this tiny company has pioneered an incredible new &quot;polymorphic&quot; substance... . And that substance is about to transform dozens of global industries worth at least $3.1 trillion per year. . In the history of human commerce, this is by far the biggest combined market ever targeted by a single company... . | . This excerpt is dripping with Big&hellip; . &ldquo;HUGE profit opportunity.&rdquo; . &nbsp;&ldquo;Only seen twice in history.&rdquo; . &ldquo;World-changing&rdquo; . &ldquo;By far the biggest.&rdquo; . And &ldquo;Even as you read this,&rdquo; indicates that it&rsquo;s happening NOW, without your knowledge&hellip; . &nbsp;Tickling the FOMO trigger. . I LOVE this excerpt because you can find a strong presence of New, Safe, and Big in these few short sentences. . Because this promo is not offering a &ldquo;system&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; for the reader to follow, it doesn&rsquo;t lean too much on the Easy emotion. . And that&rsquo;s okay. . Every line of copy doesn&rsquo;t have to have all four emotions. . You&rsquo;ll start to recognize that as you begin binging copy on your own. . And remember, if you want the full promo for any of the excerpts I&rsquo;ve shown, you can have them totally free at: www.kylethewriter.com/swipe . Summing Up The Big 4 Emotions&hellip; . Now that you understand that an entire body of copy is driven by four main emotions and their alter egos&hellip; . I think you are ready to dive into the nuances of the different sections of copy. . There are also four of them, too. . But no cool name this time (maybe there will be when I write the second edition of this book). . The Four Sections of Copy . All words in a piece of copy are not created equal. . Remember that the Big 4 should be weaved into virtually every line of copy&hellip; . And aside from those emotions, specific words have specific roles to play, depending on what section of the copy they are in. . There is an order to a sales letter, and that is important. . Abandon the order, and the copy doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense. . So think of it like this&hellip; . In English we say: &ldquo;The red apple.&rdquo; . In Spanish it&rsquo;s reversed; &ldquo;La manzana roja.&rdquo; Translated literally: &ldquo;The apple red.&rdquo; . If you screw around with the order, the meaning isn&rsquo;t totally lost&hellip; . But it sure is mangled. . And that is bad for keeping the attention of busy and skeptical readers. . So to simplify everything, let&rsquo;s break the copy into four sections&hellip; . And we will have specific things to look for in each section while we are actively reading&hellip; . The four sections of copy are: . The headline | The lead | The body | The offer | Before we dive in, remember the goal of this guide&hellip; . This guide is meant to decode the language of copywriting. . It will be the tool that allows you to decipher the subtext in each section of copy. . You just need to know what to look for&hellip; . So in this upcoming section you&rsquo;ll get a brand new method to help you perform active reading. . As you learn the framework for copywriting in this next section&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll also learn to TRANSLATE the subliminal messages of the copywriting language into &ldquo;plain English.&rdquo; It will seem like I&rsquo;m telling you WHAT to write, but that is not our goal with this. . I&rsquo;m teaching you how to TRANSLATE what you are reading&hellip; . Then you will be able to accomplish the greater goal of &ldquo;binging&rdquo; good copywriting&hellip; . You want to learn how to effectively BINGE. . That should be your main focus. . Because if you can binge on good copywriting&hellip; . You can recognize the obvious patterns. . Like when I binged too much of &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; and ruined the show for myself. . After that, you&rsquo;ll know everything you need to write your own amazing copy with ease. . Section 1: The Headline . A crazy amount of the information must be conveyed very early in the copy. . Unfortunately, most readers won&rsquo;t read much further than the headline&hellip; . So you&rsquo;ve got to cram a lot of stuff into your copy right away. . You&rsquo;ve probably heard this before, but if you haven&rsquo;t: . &ldquo;The purpose of a headline is to grab attention.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a VERY simplistic way to put it and there is A LOT to unpack from that line. . In fact, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; way to put it, and this section will uncover the underlying assumptions that often go undiscussed. . First, we should discuss the structure of a headline. . The Structure of the Headline Complex . Here&rsquo;s the headline for The Hottest IPO In History . . The line at the top: “WARNING: Limited Spots Available” is referred to as the “eyebrow.” . The headline is &ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History.&rdquo; . The stuff below the headline, the &ldquo;99.9%...goes public!&rdquo; is referred to as &ldquo;deck copy.&rdquo; . You could call the testimonial beneath &ldquo;deck copy.&rdquo; . You could call it &ldquo;the testimonial box.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s where my structure expertise ends because it doesn&rsquo;t much matter what you label it. . The 4 U&rsquo;s . The quickest method for translating a headline is to identify four elements commonly labeled as &ldquo;The Four U&rsquo;s.&rdquo; (lots of fours in this guide, huh?) . A google search told me that the 4 U&rsquo;s were originally developed by legendary entrepreneur and copywriter, Mark Ford. . Ford co-founded American Writers and Artists, Inc&hellip; . And The Palm Beach Letter, the flagship investment advisory for Palm Beach Research Group. . I haven&rsquo;t done any further research on how the 4 U&rsquo;s were developed or what they specifically meant to Mark Ford. . That being said: Ford may have slightly different definitions than I&rsquo;m sharing here, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be material differences. . So in this section, I&rsquo;m going to be explaining what the four U&rsquo;s mean to me, personally. . The four U&rsquo;s are: . Urgent | Unique | Useful | Ultra-Specific | . All four do not have to be present for a headline to work. . But if 2 or more are missing, the headline will probably not hold attention. . Urgent . Urgency is easy. . Just convey that there is a limited time to read this piece of copy and get in on this opportunity. . When you see a date in the headline, its sole purpose is to convey urgency. . “Take action by December 21” . “Sale ends this Friday” . Usually, when one conveys the Big emotion in the headline, it also creates urgency through FOMO. . FOMO is like a cousin of urgency. . Consider the Hottest IPO headline again: . &ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History&rdquo; . . There is nothing specifically urgent about it&hellip; but there is a hint of urgency within the FOMO it generates. . The &ldquo;deck copy&rdquo; beneath the headline teases more urgency with the &ldquo;BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s another subtle example from Money Map: . . Notice how the copywriter says it&rsquo;s ABOUT to go public. . Also you&rsquo;ll see the Big emotion and FOMO clearly at play here. . Many times, copywriters just go right for the throat with urgency. . Here&rsquo;s an example from a headline with clear urgency&hellip; . I wrote this during the cryptocurrency boom: . . Urgency is the simplest U, and one of the U&rsquo;s that could be discarded from the headline, so long as the other 3 are present. . One of my favorite promos was Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Money Zone&rdquo; promo. . That was a very successful promo, and there was zero urgency in the headline. . Take a look&hellip; . . Ultra-Specific . The next U is Ultra-specific. . Find some way to make the opportunity &ldquo;weirdly&rdquo; specific. . Don&rsquo;t tell someone they can make $10,000. . Tell them they can make $10,251 (odd numbers supposedly work best). . Don&rsquo;t tell them they&rsquo;ll look 10 years younger&hellip; . Tell them they&rsquo;ll look 12 and a half years younger. . Starting to get it? . Don&rsquo;t tell them their strength will improve 100%... . Tell them it will improve 251%. . Alright. . So that&rsquo;s one way. . Another way to plug in some ultra-specificity is with speed. . Selling a karate course? . &ldquo;A 3-second karate move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo; . The specific numbers imply that the headline&rsquo;s claim has been tested and proven before. . The line: &ldquo;A 3-second move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo; implies that this move has in fact worked in 3 seconds before&hellip; . AND the move worked for someone who weighed 134 pounds less than their opponent. . The reason ultra-specificity is so important is it plants depth into the claim. . In short, it makes the headline seem REAL. . It increases believability. . At least enough that the reader may investigate further. . In The Hottest IPO example above, the promise was &ldquo;can turn the average retirement into $588,000 or more&hellip; . BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo; . In the 70-Cent Crypto example above: &ldquo;turn a small sum into $2.7 million.&rdquo; . Go as specific as legally possible, and don&rsquo;t lie. . Generally, the ultra-specific claim should be based on an example that you will demonstrate in your lead or body copy. . Consider the lead copy of 70 Cent Crypto: . . See how right away we explain where the $2.7 million claim came from? . Ultra-specific is another one of the U&rsquo;s that can be discarded, so long as the other 3 U&rsquo;s are still present. . Money Map&rsquo;s Money Zone promo claimed you could make &ldquo;up to $11,000 a week&rdquo; and it worked very well. . I would say that line is sorta specific. . Not &ldquo;ultra.&rdquo; . And that promo&rsquo;s headline didn&rsquo;t even have ANY urgency! . Unique . Unique is non-negotiable. . Because unique is a synonym for New and novel. . We know from The Big 4 Emotions that New is the foundation of strong copy. . If your headline offers up something the reader has seen before, they will not waste their precious time reading it. . Think about the health niche, where diets come and go. . Is anybody still trying to sell you on the Atkins diet? . A while back it was EVERYWHERE. . But after a while it wasn&rsquo;t New. . And it wasn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;magic bullet solution&rdquo; many people thought it would be. . And thus, they began their search for the next &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; that would make them a healthier, fitter, sexier person&hellip; . overnight. . The South Beach Diet was first called the &ldquo;Modified Carbohydrate Diet.&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t a sexy sell&hellip; . After rebranding the diet as something New (The South Beach Diet), it took off. . In 2018, the ketogenic diet (keto) was the hot new diet. . And I bet in 2019 keto will all but disappear, except for within the circles of intense keto advocates. . New diets will continue to emerge and dominate simply because the market demands it. . People who struggle to consistently diet and exercise will always be looking for the easier solution. . That&rsquo;s one of the things that makes &ldquo;unique&rdquo; so captivating. . Take a look at this Money Map headline for their Night Trader Product&hellip; . The copywriter infers &ldquo;this is different&rdquo; by starting with &ldquo;99.99% of American Investors Trade During the Day&hellip;&rdquo; . And then moving into&hellip; . &ldquo;While other people toss and turn&hellip;&rdquo; . This conveys the subtext that he is doing something New&hellip; . He&rsquo;s the Only person doing it (or at least in the 00.01%)&hellip; . And that makes it Unique! . If the reader has been struggling for success in the stock market, this headline offers up some secret knowledge about a New, unique method that they&rsquo;ve never heard of&hellip; . This headline offers hope because it is unique! . Another example of unique&rsquo;s power can be found by referring back to the Money Zone headline from the previous section&hellip; . I would argue that the uniqueness of the Money Zone headline&hellip; . Where they claim America&rsquo;s #1 stock analyst is &ldquo;DONE with stocks!&rdquo;... . Is where the power of the headline came from. . How often does the #1 person at anything announce they are completely giving that thing up? Something New and better must have been uncovered! . The copywriter understood that nothing is more important than being New and Novel&hellip; . When you plant something unique in your headline, you are conveying the New emotion in the subtext. . To convey something unique, just pull one item from your product or offer, and emphasize it. . The Money Zone product doesn&rsquo;t trade traditional stocks. . The Night Trader product trades at night. . It&rsquo;s not rocket science. . Your product probably has more than one unique element to it. . For instance, here is a second headline for The Hottest IPO that I wrote&hellip; . . This headline is selling the same product as The Hottest IPO, but with a completely fresh and unique idea. . The main selling point of The Hottest IPO and The $15 Trillion Gadget is that self-driving cars are going to be very disruptive. . So I was able to tie that idea of self-driving cars to an IPO and also tie it to the physical parts that make self-driving cars work. . This is useful for refreshing fatiguing copy, but that&rsquo;s a little advanced for this section. . The point is&hellip; . finding something unique in your offer or product just requires a little critical thinking. . Just Highlight Something . Don&rsquo;t spin your wheels trying to make your idea totally &ldquo;revolutionary.&rdquo; . Finding something unique isn&rsquo;t that hard. . In fact, that is probably the hardest part&hellip; . There is no &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; for you. . It probably won&rsquo;t &ldquo;jump out at you.&rdquo; . Because your unique element could be any insignificant thing. . There just needs to be a unique element in your headline that the reader has never, ever seen before. . An easy &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to think about this: &ldquo;The first BLANK to ever&hellip;&rdquo; . &ldquo;The first skin cream to ever use volcanic ash.&rdquo; . &ldquo;The first options trading system to ever exclusively trade 25 cent options&hellip;&rdquo; This conveys New, and New conveys unique. . I want to push you away from copying down this line and using it. . Because I don&rsquo;t necessarily want you to directly state this line in your headline. . In fact, I almost deleted this &ldquo;hack&rdquo; example from this guide&hellip; . For fear you would simply use it as a bland template. . This &ldquo;hack&rdquo; is supposed to get your mind thinking about the subtext you need to convey: NEW. . Remember, I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write&hellip; . I&rsquo;m offering tools to help you translate the copywriting language so YOU can speak it fluently. . Let&rsquo;s look over a quick example to show what I mean&hellip; . The 70 Cent Crypto headline is a great example. . . When we wrote this promo, cryptocurrencies were hot. . Everybody was piling into crypto. . So how could I make headline about cryptocurrencies feel unique? I could just pick one element about the crypto and highlight it. . All I had to do was draw attention to how cheap the crypto was and voila. . I wouldn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;The first crypto ever to be 70 cents and could make you rich.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why templates are bad news. . Once you can speak the copywriting language, your headline will use words that are as natural to you as how you describe your favorite restaurant. . Think about this&hellip; . If you wanted to convince me to go to your favorite restaurant, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t say: . &ldquo;How do I get Kyle interested in this restaurant? Ummm&hellip; It&rsquo;s the first restaurant ever to&hellip; Uhhh&hellip; the first restaurant ever to give me two loaves of bread before dinner?&rdquo; . If you try to fit your writing into a tight template, it will stifle your abilities... . It will kill your ability to create something New... . And that will kill your success. . We are not putting together a piece of furniture when we build a headline&hellip; . We are speaking a language of subtext and emotion. . Always, always, always, start your process THERE. . Think to yourself &ldquo;I know the subtext I must communicate, what words might do that best?&rdquo; And make sure your headline has some unique element or idea in it. . Useful . The reader will not care to read your copy if they do not feel they will draw something useful from it. . This means you will already need to know what your audience finds &ldquo;useful...&rdquo; . This will require some research. . To write something truly useful, you&rsquo;ll want to know: . Who your ideal prospect is | What topics they are curious about today | What promises or benefits would compel them to continue reading on | . One approach is to directly offer a benefit: . &ldquo;Make money&rdquo; . &ldquo;Look younger&rdquo; . Etc&hellip; . Or you can offer information on a specific topic that is top of mind, that they are interested in&hellip; . Take a look at this headline by Palm Beach Research Group for their product, The Palm Beach Letter. . . This headline refers to President Trump&rsquo;s tax reform, which was highly covered by the media. . You can see the copywriter took something top of mind and made it useful. . When you know what is top of mind for your reader, you can write something that strikes a specific chord of intrigue. . Intrigue Alone is NOT Useful &ndash; What&rsquo;s In It For Me? (WIIFM) . I have seen experienced copywriters make this mistake before... . They&rsquo;ll show me a headline and say, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; . I search and search but then I&rsquo;m forced to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; . And then they&rsquo;ll say something like, &ldquo;Well, this is a topic they should really be interested in reading more about...&rdquo; . Then they frown and realize that intrigue alone is not going to cut it. . Sometimes even great writers can get caught up in the excitement of their idea. . But great copywriters also know that intrigue alone is not enough to pull a reader into your sales letter. . Once this error is pointed out to them, experienced copywriters immediately go back to the drawing board without argument. . Remember, everyone wants to know &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In It For Me?&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;WIIFM is everyone&rsquo;s favorite radio station.&rdquo; . Your headline must be useful to the reader. . Going back to the Palm Beach Letter headline: &ldquo;We Snuck Through!&rdquo; . That is a cool, intriguing headline&hellip; . Snuck through where??? . The writer teases the usefulness via &ldquo;income tricks&rdquo; while introducing a topic that is top of mind: tax reform. . &ldquo;18 Little&mdash;Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo; . And finally, really making it REALLY useful for the reader, the writer drops the line: . &ldquo;A new FREE BOOK reveals how you could collect up to $6,842 per month thanks to these 100% legal ideas&hellip;&rdquo; . And if you&rsquo;re really paying attention, you should be able to see how we are incorporating different elements we&rsquo;ve learned in the previous sections. . It All Adds Up . Let&rsquo;s take a moment to go through this&hellip; . The words &ldquo;little known&rdquo; and &ldquo;loopholes&rdquo; imply you can &ldquo;Only&rdquo; get this knowledge from me. . Otherwise everyone would know. . Only is New&rsquo;s powerful alter ego. . The link to Trump&rsquo;s tax reforms makes the headline Safe... . By tying the headline to the government and the law, the opportunity has the highest level of credibility. . Making $6,842 per month is ultra-specific, useful, &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . Predictable because per month implies the income will repeat on a monthly basis. . A FREE BOOK is cheap enough for Anyone to Easily afford. . And &ldquo;100% legal ideas&rdquo; implies that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything out of the ordinary, shady, or difficult. . See how many boxes have been checked... . All of it neatly wrapped into the headline. . Wrapping Up The Headline . Perhaps without this guide, you might have seen a headline like, &ldquo;&ldquo;WE SNUCK THROUGH!&rdquo; 18 Little&mdash; Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo; . And thought: &ldquo;benefit driven headline.&rdquo; But now, in this guide&hellip; . Right in front of you&hellip; . You have all the tools you need to pick apart headlines like this and see what they really communicate. . The copywriting language is a direct link to a reader&rsquo;s emotional triggers. . The language is communicated purely through the subtext. . All you have to do is keep your focus on The Big 4. . Already you&rsquo;ve seen how a copywriter can communicate New, Easy, Safe and Big in a wild variety of ways. . You&rsquo;ve seen that the words do not matter&hellip; . Only what the words imply. . That&rsquo;s why I try very hard to never tell you what to write&hellip; . Because I want YOU to develop the your copywriting fluency to a point that you intuitively know you communicate something is Easy simply by calling it &ldquo;100% legal.&rdquo; . Going forward, you&rsquo;ll know with a quick glance whether a headline is doing its job well or not. . And you&rsquo;ll be able to binge hundreds of headlines this way&hellip; . Uncovering the subliminal patterns that make the best ones work so well. . Now that you know what elements must be communicated, via the language of copywriting, you can quickly form your own headlines. . And I didn&rsquo;t tell you a single thing to write&hellip; . Because it isn&rsquo;t what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . When you know you must communicate urgency&hellip; the words will just come naturally. . And it will be more and more natural as you binge more and more copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll recognize the common patterns of how other writers convey urgency. . It will be the same when you know you must communicate uniqueness: the words will come naturally. . You know you must communicate ultra-specificity&hellip; . The words will come naturally. . You know you must communicate usefulness&hellip; and guess what? . The words will come as naturally as saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful day outside&rdquo; in plain English. . And very soon, as you make your way through the rest of this guide&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll be able to go from headline to P.S. writing your own piece of copy&hellip; . Powerfully communicating in the language of copywriting with ease. . You&rsquo;ll see that virtually every line in a successful piece of copy serves a purpose. . And once you know how to translate the subtext from the words&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . For the first time ever, you&rsquo;ll speak the same language as the best copywriters in the world. . You&rsquo;ll be unstoppable. . Section 2: The Lead . The lead is what immediately follows the headline and in terms of the Big 4, the lead is the generally the densest area of a piece of copy. . It would not be crazy to think you could spend 30 minutes picking apart the first 500 words of a piece of copy. . I have a few ways to sum up a lead. . A Lead Is Like The Abstract To A Scholarly Journal Article. . If you&rsquo;ve ever looked up a scholarly journal article, they always have an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; at the top. . Or you might see it on the preview page where they ask you to pay for the full article. . In an abstract, the researcher has to communicate pretty much all the major details of the study. . That could be the major details about the sample, the methods, and the results. . And that serves as a high-level summary of the what you can expect if you purchase the research article&hellip; . If a reader wants the finer details, they buy or read the whole article. . That&rsquo;s basically what a copywriter is tasked to do when writing a lead. . Here are the FIVE major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead: . Capture attention (Can be done in headline) | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a big promise | Open a loop (bribe) | . But before we get into the step-by-steps, we have to cover some ground rules. . A Lead Should Contain The Most Compelling Claims and Info That Will Be Covered In The Copy . A copywriter has to cram some of the &ldquo;major&rdquo; information about what will be covered in the body copy into the first couple pages&hellip; . Or approximately 500-ish words. . Keep in mind, leads can vary in length. . In long form sales letters, I&rsquo;ve seen leads range anywhere from 2-7 pages. . Basically, you&rsquo;ll want to tease your most compelling claim or claims and produce your general sales message in the lead. . And you haven&rsquo;t started proving your claims by page 7, you probably need to scale the lead back. . At a minimum: . The Lead Should Introduce the Fundamental Claim or Idea That Will Be Covered or Proven in the Body Copy. . That does NOT mean you must reveal the offer or product in the lead. . Not even a little bit. . In many sales letters, the offer or product is hidden until the very last few pages. . Usually in a long form sales letter, the lead&rsquo;s purpose is to build hype about an opportunity&hellip; . Or really illustrate the terrible problem that needs to be solved. . It does that by acutely focusing on the Big 4, right up until the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; is introduced. . Often, once the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; behind the letter (the guy selling something) is introduced, the lead is over. . And essentially, by the time you reach the end of the lead, all the major information that would make your prospect want to buy should have already been conveyed. . The rest of the letter, called the body copy, is just &ldquo;proving the point.&rdquo; . A Lead Offers ONE Big Idea or Promise Which Can Be Summed Up In A Single Sentence . In my experience, writing a lead is an &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; process. . That is, I won&rsquo;t actually know everything that will be in the lead until the promo is about fully written. . Sometimes when I&rsquo;m writing the body copy I&rsquo;ll discover some neat hook, a weird angle, or a new piece of information I could go back and inject into the lead. . It&rsquo;s been the same while writing this guide. . I started writing this guide knowing the &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; I wanted to take the text. . I had ONE idea. . Which I could sum up in a single sentence&hellip; . &ldquo;Copywriting is a language, communicated purely through subtext.&rdquo; . I started my introduction by writing some of the things I THOUGHT I would cover&hellip; . But as I&rsquo;ve been writing the book, it has taken a life and direction of its own. . And I keep having to go back and change my introduction to tease what is really be covered. . It&rsquo;s the same thing with any lead, in my experience. . But you should still only have one idea. . The Headline, Lead, and Body Copy Share a &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . Before you write a word of copy, summarize your idea in one sentence. . This is the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of your letter. . It is the lifeforce that compelled you to write your piece of copy in the first place. . The reason for this is you NEED a single coherent direction. . Start with this question: what is the one major benefit or payoff that everything in your copy will tie to? I&rsquo;ve heard this called &ldquo;The Golden Thread.&rdquo; . And it&rsquo;s also been referred to as &ldquo;The Rule of One.&rdquo; I call it the &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . Ideally, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what the Soul of your copy is before you start writing. . But as I mentioned earlier, for me writing the lead is an &ldquo;ongoing process.&rdquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I like the term &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . It gives your idea permission to exist like a living thing&hellip; . Something that grows and evolves over time. . Sometimes your Soul will be crystal clear&hellip; . Sometimes you will have to hash out a couple attempts to focus or find your Soul. . But you should always have some sense for what your Soul is about. . New information should just sharpen the Soul and make it clearer. . The point is, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if your Soul starts a little vague when you write the first version of your lead. . But at the end of writing your copy, EVERYTHING should be tied to ONE idea that you can sum up in a single sentence. . For example, I wrote a promo called Trump Bonus Checks with another copywriter, Rob Braddock. . We had ONE sentence to guide all of our writing. . That sentence was EXACTLY THIS: . &ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo; . . That was the Soul of our promo. . If anything we wrote deviated from that message in any way, it was promptly deleted. . Okay, knowing all these things I&rsquo;ve explained about the lead&hellip; . Again, here are the FOUR major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead: . Capture attention | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a Big Promise | Open a loop | . The Lead Should Capture Attention . To capture attention, some copywriters begin their lead with what is called a pattern interrupt. . &nbsp;A super easy way to quickly capture a reader&rsquo;s attention is to just show them something&hellip; . Preferably something they haven&rsquo;t seen before in another ad. . Here&rsquo;s a couple examples from promos I have worked on. . Notice how all the lead text starts in a similar fashion&hellip; . . . . . Coming up with a pattern interrupt isn&rsquo;t rocket science. . Just try to get the reader to focus attention on you. . Be aware of what your competitors are putting in front of your reader as pattern interrupts. . You do not want to present your reader with something they have seen before. . Now you know you can grab their attention in the lead with a pattern interrupt&hellip; . Or, if you think your headline complex by itself was a strong enough pattern interrupt, you can build their intrigue by expanding upon your headline. . The Lead Should Expand Upon the Headline . You&rsquo;ll want the lead to flow right out of your headline and offer some additional relevant information about your headline. . This is sometimes called a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo; . Payoffs . Your headline should generate sufficient curiosity for the reader to want to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about. . The next line out of the headline should give them just a little bit more detail without giving away anything too particular. . Some folks refer to this as a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo; . I can demonstrate the payoff concept in the first couple lines of a successful marketing email I wrote for The $15 Trillion Gadget. . Tiny, Incredible Gadget Could Bring $15 Trillion&hellip; . Dear Reader, . A gadget you could conceal in the palm of your hand&hellip; . That could easily pass through airport security&hellip; . And could be mass-produced quickly&hellip; . Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a breakthrough $15 trillion tech revolution&hellip; . Of course this will make a lot of investors very rich&hellip; . But it will also scare lot of people. . Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, &ldquo;Once the massive market disruption begins&hellip; &nbsp;we expect significant turmoil.&rdquo; . The boom is coming either way. . It&rsquo;s your choice whether you want to grow wealthy&hellip; &nbsp;or just be scared. . Click here now to learn about what&rsquo;s coming. . | . The sales letter I wrote this email for has nothing to do with airport security&hellip; . Or much to do with the gadget or its mass production abilities. . If you&rsquo;ll recall from earlier, this sales letter was about self-driving cars. . So we have our headline (or subject line, for this email): . &ldquo;Tiny, Incredible Gadget Could Bring $15 Trillion&hellip;&rdquo; . Then the first couple lines of this email are little nothing &ldquo;payoffs&rdquo; I give the reader to expand on the headline&hellip; . They don&rsquo;t really offer any new useful information&hellip; . They are just something I use to capture and hold the reader&rsquo;s attention while I shift gears to the real opportunity I want to talk about&hellip; . The technology inside the gadget, and its potential money rewards. . That&rsquo;s when I drop the line: . &ldquo;Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a breakthrough $15 trillion tech revolution&hellip;&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s the big promise I really want them to read. . It was the same strategy with the pattern interrupt examples above. . I captured the reader&rsquo;s attention just long enough to shift to my big promise&hellip; . Which is usually something like: &ldquo;You can get rich from this.&rdquo; . You want to get to your one big promise as soon as possible. . As. Soon. As. &nbsp;Possible. . Here&rsquo;s another example of expanding upon the headline in promo I wrote for Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass&hellip; . . Throughout this entire excerpt of copy, I&rsquo;m simply expanding upon the &ldquo;49 Retirement Income Tricks&rdquo; I mentioned in the headline. . Okay let&rsquo;s recap what we have so far&hellip; . Recap for the first two: . Get their attention with the headline and the 4 U&rsquo;s&hellip; . Pattern interrupts are a powerful and easy way to capture attention. . Expand on your headline&hellip; . And remember, when you expand upon the headline, you do not have to give away your secrets. . You can just list properties about the subject that your headline focused on. . The goal is to build curiosity, intrigue, and/or hype. . Then, offer your ONE big promise as soon as possible. . P.S. &nbsp;As extra practice, you can start to look for the Big 4 in all the examples above. . | . The Lead Should Offer Credibility . Very early in your lead, the copy should offer credibility that explains why your reader should believe you. . Thinking about it logically &ndash; You should have made a big promise in your headline&hellip; . Your promise is weird and specific enough to capture and hold attention&hellip; . It offers something the reader wants&hellip; . And chances are, the reader is so cynical and skeptical they are on the edge of shouting &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; the first chance they get. . In fact, they can&rsquo;t wait to call bullshit on a &ldquo;scammy marketer&rdquo; like you. . They live for it! . This is the time to inject some cred that proves either: . You are a credible authority, who should be listened to, or&hellip; | Your claims are supported by credible authorities | You do not need to make a big show of credibility in the lead. . Just a single line will do for now. . Because as you&rsquo;ll see when we explore the body copy, there is a more appropriate time to lay the credibility on thick. . If we refer back to that short email I wrote, you&rsquo;ll see I inject some credibility after my big promise by quoting an authority: . &ldquo;Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, &ldquo;Once the massive market disruption begins&hellip; we expect significant turmoil.&rdquo; &ldquo; . We don&rsquo;t know how or why the turmoil will come&hellip; . But a guy with a fancy title said he expects it&hellip; . That communicates the event is basically inevitable! . (Communicating something is probable/inevitable communicates our the Big 4 Emotion of Safe/Predictable&hellip; . Are you starting to see how these lessons are building on each other more and more?) . I then have to quickly move to a call to action after that credibility line because it was a short email, not a sales letter. . This email has proved consistently that by the time a reader reaches the end of it&hellip; . That about 11% of people are sufficiently intrigued and convinced that whatever this thing is, it&rsquo;s real and interesting enough to them to click the link and learn more... . And these readers get a lot of marketing emails every single day. . Also consider this: Clicking a link is an action the reader has to take. . That&rsquo;s some form of investment or micro-commitment, which is a decent feat in persuasion. . For a copywriter starting their lead, their job is simpler. . They just need make sure the reader takes NO action besides reading the next line. . Another Example: . We can also look back to the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass letter for an example of credibility. . You&rsquo;ll notice that the opening line IS, in fact, credibility. . &ldquo;Dear Reader, . I&rsquo;m Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time.&rdquo; . I had utilized a significant amount of deck copy to expand my headline&hellip; . And dropping credibility in the first line was easy and natural. . There is no hard and fast &ldquo;specific&rdquo; timing with the four things you must do in the lead. . I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write. . I&rsquo;m simply highlighting patterns of subtext that is usually communicated by the best copywriters. . I have personally followed these patterns to great success. . And I know you can too. . So we have captured attention&hellip; . Expanded upon the headline&hellip; . And inserted some credibility&hellip; what now? . The Lead Should Offer The Big Promise . As I stated earlier, you want to get to your big promise as quickly as possible. . There are no specific words you must use. . You should write whatever comes most naturally. . It&rsquo;s possible your Big Promise will change slightly from the time you start your writing until you finish. . That&rsquo;s okay. . When constructing your big promise, use the Big 4 Emotions as a guide: . New / Only | Easy / Anybody | Safe / Predictable | Big / Fast | . Some products lend themselves to certain emotions more than others. . For instance, if a writer wants to sell a product based around a &ldquo;system&hellip;&rdquo; . It could be a system to help lonely, single people go on more dates&hellip; . A system for hopeless couch potatoes to lose 20 pounds&hellip; . A system for broke people to generate passive income&hellip; . It could be anything about a step by step system / push-button solution / done-for-you product&hellip; . The writer may want to lean more heavily on introducing and proving claims about how Fast the system pays out benefits and how Anybody can use it. . The Big Promise should reflect that as well. . If a copywriter is writing about a prediction&hellip; . A trend that the copywriter wants readers to buy into early&hellip; . If the writer is trying to convince a person that something is on its way and the reader needs to act fast&hellip; . Then the copywriter will lean on emotions of New and Big to rile up that fear of missing out. . Throughout the copy, the copywriter will want to hit on as many of the Big 4 Emotions as possible&hellip; . But a writer can lean much more heavily on the two or three that naturally favor their offer. . Which ones the writer chooses as the most important to their message will make up the remainder of their lead. . But if you can, jam as many of the Big 4 Emotions as you can early into your lead. . Let&rsquo;s revisit the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass lead&hellip; . . Here&rsquo;s my Big Promise&hellip; . &ldquo;All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even . $4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out&hellip;&rdquo; . My Big Promise actually states the words &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because the promise is for passive income. . Someone who wants passive income wants money to come on auto-pilot. . They don&rsquo;t want to have to tinker with anything. . They don&rsquo;t want to worry about the fluctuations of the stock market. . They just want the money to come and come on time. . Set it and forget it. . So I stress that this is safe and predictable in my promise. . Also, the phrase &ldquo;All it takes&hellip;&rdquo; indicates there is an abundance of &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; in this offer. . And all you need to do is take advantage of a couple of the 49 secrets. Easy. . At the same time I&rsquo;m promising Big income numbers, up in the thousands of dollars. . And the opportunity is totally New because this information has never been in any of the past books that Robert has written! . The Lead Should Open A Loop . At this point in the lead, the writer has brought up their big promise and presented their most compelling claims&hellip; . Now they need to create an &ldquo;open loop.&rdquo; . An open loop is just a &ldquo;tease&rdquo; for information that will be revealed later in the letter. . This is also referred to as a &ldquo;bribe.&rdquo; (I got the term &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; from Clayton Makepeace). . It&rsquo;s a bribe you offer them in exchange for them to continue reading. . Luckily, opening a loop is pretty simple to execute, and can be written like: . &ldquo;In just a second, I will show you exactly how &lsquo;the claims I just said&rsquo; are totally true.&rdquo; This is a simple open loop&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll see variants as you binge copy&hellip; . Another common example: . &ldquo;If you stick with me, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt how you can &lsquo;receive the benefits I promised.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Just look over a couple pieces of copy and next thing you&rsquo;ll know, you&rsquo;ll be able to rattle off 10 different lines to open a loop. . And you&rsquo;ll find methods that are far more subtle than asking the reader to stick around. . In fact, in just a second I&rsquo;ll show you a masterfully written open loop right out of an actual sales letter. . But first&hellip; . Putting A Lead Together . We see the lead usually contains five basic elements . Capture attention | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a Big Promise | Open a loop (bribe) | . When you look at leads the way I have described, the job becomes fairly straightforward. . The copywriter should already understand the Soul of his project. . He has summed up his idea in a single sentence. . i.e. for Trump Bonus Checks we used &ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo; Then the copywriter is tasked with proving that idea. . The writers task is to find information that proves the claims&hellip; . Then communicate them through the Big 4 Emotions. . Once you see that, and truly grasp it in your bones&hellip; . Writing copy just becomes a system of answering simple questions. . Start with: . The soul of my promo summed up in a single sentence is&hellip; . Then: . &ldquo;How do I prove this is Big? &nbsp;What can I compare it to that was Big already?&rdquo; . &ldquo;How can I demonstrate to the reader how Easy and Fast this is?&rdquo; . The best writers in the world know this&hellip; . Even though it&rsquo;s quite possible they don&rsquo;t consciously know that they are doing it this way. . Because they think they just &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; . They speak the language of copywriting. . Just like when you talk to your friends&hellip; . You don&rsquo;t consciously realize when you are conjugating verbs or using adjectives to modify nouns. . You just do it. . After years of practice, the master copywriters eventually come to speak the language of copywriting. . But it won&rsquo;t take you years of practice. . Starting today (or whenever you finish this guide)&hellip; . You can look at a line of copy and immediately translate what the writer was trying to accomplish. . And I mean ANY old random line of copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll know EXACTLY why it was written&hellip; even if it is completely out of context! . Any Single Line of Copy . As proof of the practical use of this guide&hellip; . I&rsquo;ve grabbed a single, random line of copy from the lead of a sales letter in my swipe file. . If you&rsquo;ve paid attention to every word up to this point in the guide&hellip; . You know everything you must know to translate its true meaning. . Here&rsquo;s the one line: . &ldquo;Plus multiple triple-digit wins of up to 542% in the coming months...&rdquo; . See if you can use what you&rsquo;ve learned to translate this single, out of context line. . What do you think the writer was trying to communicate? . You know this line is in the lead&hellip; . And you have the Big 4 Emotions framework to go by&hellip; . Take a shot at it on your own, then I&rsquo;ll go into it with you. . Does the translation jump out at you yet? . Let&rsquo;s see if we can figure out what this single line communicates&hellip; REALLY. . Since this is in the lead, it looks like the copywriter is setting up a promise or claim he will have to prove later in the body copy&hellip; . And what are they trying to communicate with this claim? . &ldquo;Multiple&rdquo; = more than one chance to profit = Safe. | &ldquo;Triple digit wins&rdquo; = Big&nbsp;wins. | &ldquo;542%&rdquo; is specific enough to imply some intense calculation has been run to produce this number = Safe. | That 542% number is a pretty nice return = Big. | &ldquo;Coming months&rdquo; = Predictable. | . When you translate each word using just the Big 4 Emotions as your decoder&hellip; . You can see this line was designed to communicate that the opportunity is both Big and Safe. . This is one line of copy from a 37-page promo. . Now imagine you binged and translated copy like this for multiple sales letters&hellip; . You dug into each line to find what it was truly communicating&hellip; . It would not take you long at all before you&rsquo;d see&hellip; . These sales-letter things are all pretty similar. . Then you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . Finally, you&rsquo;ll speak the language of copywriting with ease. . A Quick Exercise: Translate The Copy That Surrounds That Single Line . Below I&rsquo;ll post the rest of the copy that surrounds that single line we just translated. . It&rsquo;s from a sales letter by Money Map Press. . The headline is: . Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker I&rsquo;ve dissected this promo on my YouTube. . Since you&rsquo;re probably reading this as a digital copy, I&rsquo;ll give you the URL to that YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/Fv7zwDItHlk . Copy and paste that link and you can see me dissect the entire sales letter for free. . Also, you can have access to my entire swipe file with my notes in the margins by going to: http://kylethewriter.com/swipe . I don&rsquo;t want to make sales pitches inside a book you paid money for, but I thought you might be interested in these free resources. . Here&rsquo;s some of the copywriting that surrounds that single line we just translated: . As you&#39;re probably starting to realize, this is a historic breakthrough. . And if you play it the way I&#39;m going to show you... . You could haul in the kinds of profits that only come around once in a century. . I&#39;m talking about the chance to score up to 10,000% returns or moreover just the next few years... . Plus multiple triple-digit wins of up to 542% in the coming months... . And the potential for literally hundreds of times your money long term. . How can I be SURE this company could score you such huge profits? . I&#39;ll show you right now... . The Pentagon is handing you this win on a silver platter. . | . This is the end of the lead for that promo. . The lead is 382 words long. . Then the writer transitions into the body copy next by introducing the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; in what I call &ldquo;the credibility section.&rdquo; . This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy. . But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip; . Earlier I said I would show you an open loop. . Do you see it? . The open loop was: . &ldquo;If you play it the way I&rsquo;m going to show you&hellip;&rdquo; . The copywriter is SAYING you can make a bunch of money&hellip; . But what he is really communicating &nbsp;is: . &ldquo;I will reveal this method to you&hellip; just keep reading&hellip;&rdquo; . Then the copy goes on to communicate: . &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to miss this, because it&rsquo;s huge! . And if you&rsquo;re nervous, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; it&rsquo;s totally safe.&rdquo; . Again, the more you practice, the more these things will jump out at you. . And I will never, ever, ever have to tell you: &ldquo;write this, write that.&rdquo; &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll just know. . One more open loop example: . If you refer back to the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass lead&hellip; . The second line is an open loop&hellip; . Dear Reader, . I&rsquo;m Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time. . Today I want to tell you about 49 retirement income secrets I did NOT include in Rich Dad Poor Dad&hellip; . Secrets that the rich love&hellip; but the poor and middle class do not know about! . All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even . $4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out&hellip; . Starting as soon as this coming Monday, January 21, 2019 . | . Oh, one last (secret) open loop example: . Maybe you caught it, but I just opened another loop above: . &ldquo;This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy. . But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip; . Earlier I said I would show you an open loop&hellip;&rdquo; . I opened a new loop RIGHT before closing my first loop by saying &ldquo;but before we dive into&hellip;&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s the easiest way to do set up loops. . After finishing this guide and binging a little bit of copy, you&rsquo;ll be able to open loops easily and automatically. . Section 3: The Body Copy . &nbsp; . Believe it or not, things start to get a lot more streamlined in the body copy. . The point of the body copy is for the copywriter to prove their claims from the lead and then any subsequent objections that may come up. . Here&rsquo;s how I like to think about the body copy&hellip; . Imagine that you have totally made your pitch in the lead. . You laid out your opportunity, the exciting promise and maybe some claims about why they should buy today. . Many people are excited and ready to buy. . But there are a bunch of very analytical folks standing there with their arms folded and they say: . &ldquo;Yeah, but...&rdquo; . That is an objection. . That reader has some sort of hesitation about your lead. . In the body copy, the copywriter&rsquo;s job is to anticipate every single &ldquo;Yeah, but&hellip;&rdquo; from their lead&hellip; . And then resolve it. . And if that sounds like a lot, once again, don&rsquo;t worry. . There is a very simple template that you can follow to crush through each objection. . In fact, while I usually recommend following emotions&hellip; . This is one of the few step-by-step templates I recommend you stick to. . You&rsquo;ll also be happy to know that there are some very common objections that are universal to almost every single sale on the planet. . After you overcome them one or two times, it will be second nature for you going forward. . The most complicated part is gathering the proof for overcoming objections. . Again, don&rsquo;t worry. . You can usually grab everything you need from a quick google search. . And once you overcome the most common objections, the bulk of your work in the body copy is done! . &nbsp;So&hellip; . In this section of the guide I&rsquo;ll offer: . The simple template that master copywriters follow when they want to prove their point | The most common objections you must overcome | The most common types of proof you can use to overcome those objections | . Let&rsquo;s start with the proof template. . The Body Template . The body copy will consist almost entirely of a copywriter repeating this single template over and over. . Like most elements of the copywriting language, you would probably never even notice that a sales letter is just repeating this over and over unless you were specifically trained to translate copy. . Good thing you have this guide, huh? . Again, I want to repeat that this is one of the few instances where I say it is a good idea for you to stick to the template almost always. . Jumping straight into the template, here it is: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit | . Feel free to drill this into your brain for a moment&hellip; . Once you grasp these four things, it will make the next two sections super easy to breeze through. . Got these four burned in your brain forever? . Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about it. . Addressing an Objection . An objection is anything in a customer&rsquo;s mind that may prevent them from buying. . An objection doesn&rsquo;t have to be a literal &ldquo;no&rdquo; sort of objection to your claim or promise&hellip; . It could also be a critical piece of information that would cause the reader to refuse to buy unless they knew it. . For instance&hellip; . If a copywriter were to claim, &ldquo;You can make a ton of money with this system&hellip;&rdquo; . A natural set of follow-up questions would be: . &ldquo;Why am I just now hearing about this?&rdquo; | &ldquo;Do I need to have experience to do this?&rdquo; | &ldquo;What guarantees do I have?&rdquo; | &ldquo;How much money can I make?&rdquo; | . None of these are outright literal &ldquo;objections,&rdquo; like someone shouting &ldquo;bullshit!&rdquo; or saying &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; . But we address them as such. . Also, please take a moment to note that I generated all four of these objections in an instant, simply by considering objections to my promise using the frame of The Big 4. . That is, each objection corresponds to one of The Big 4&hellip; . New | Easy | Safe | Big | . It took me mere seconds to generate those four objections, and I could definitely come up with more by considering the 4 alter egos. . Well, you did pay money for this guide (I hope)&hellip; . So just for you I&rsquo;ll go the extra mile now&hellip; . The Alter Egos: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast The objections: | Why should I buy this from you? | What if I don&rsquo;t have any money right now? | How do I know this will work? | How fast will I make money? | . Again, by keeping the Big 4 Emotions top of mind&hellip; . I could generate every answer I needed to communicate without ANY effort. . So now you have a set of objections you can anticipate a reasonable reader to consider. . And all you have to do at this point is follow the body copy template and answer the objections. . Remember: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit&nbsp; | . Observe: . First consider your objection: How much money can I make? . A copywriter may blatantly address the objection in their copy this way: . &ldquo;I bet by now you are probably wondering, &ldquo;how much money can I make?&rsquo;&rdquo; . Or the copywriter can cut that step and just jump straight to the next step of the template: Claim. . Before I dive into claims, I&rsquo;ll just rattle off some of the most common objections you might spot while translating copy&hellip; . Why shouldn&rsquo;t I just use an alternative? | Why should I act now? | Who are you? | Why should I listen to you? | How did you figure this out? | How does it work? | Why are you telling me about this? | Is this going to be difficult? | What do I need to get started? | Will this take a lot of time? | Is this risky? | How much will the results improve my life? / How big are the &ldquo;results?&rdquo; / How much money can I make, etc. | How fast will it take to see results? | How much does it cost? | What if it doesn&rsquo;t work? | . Making a Claim . It&rsquo;s very easy and subtler for a copywriter to anticipate an objection&hellip; . And then start a new section of copy with they state a direct claim that answers the &ldquo;unspoken&rdquo; objection. . The un-stated objection: How much money can I make? . The copywriter turns the answer (a claim) into a subhead: . &ldquo;You can make $10,000 in a week with this system.&rdquo; . Okay, that&rsquo;s a cool. . The copywriter has made their claim. . And he didn&rsquo;t need to directly state the objection (How much money can I make?) in the copy at all. . Now it&rsquo;s time for the proof. . Presenting Proof . Proof is any information that can help the copywriter substantiate their claim. . Generally, proof comes in threes. . That&rsquo;s pretty important. . The writing can feel a little &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; if the writer only offers one or two pieces of proof. . More than three is great&hellip; . But generally, three is the magic number of proof points. . Let&rsquo;s go over the most common types of proof. . Case studies | Demonstrations | Testimonials | Quotes from authorities | Charts and graphs | Official documents | Articles and headlines | . So at this stage of the template the copywriter has claimed the reader can make $10,000 with their system. . But they cannot find three pieces of proof showing $10,000 returns. . The $10,000 mark is just too high. . That&rsquo;s okay. . There&rsquo;s a simple trick for this. . Here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d do. . Proof #1: . &ldquo;Look at what happened when my proprietary system said buy Stock ABC&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock ABC* You could have made $5,000!&rdquo; . Proof #2: . &ldquo;And then the system said buy Stock DEF&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock DEF* You could have made $7,500!&rdquo; . Proof #3: . &ldquo;Now I bet you&rsquo;re pretty convinced this is a great system.&nbsp;But wait until I show you what happened when the system said to buy stock GHI&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock GHI* . You could have made a whopping $10,000!&rdquo; . The copywriter just proved you could make $10,000 with the system and provided three pieces of proof. . Show Don&rsquo;t Tell . When a copywriter is offering up their three or more pieces of proof, they would like &ldquo;show&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tell&rdquo; as often as possible. . You can try to present number gains as visuals, like the charts in the above example. . Generally with each of the three pieces of proof, you&rsquo;ll want to re-present them two to three times in different ways. . This is called a &ldquo;reframe.&rdquo; . Reframing The Proof . So in the above example, the copywriter provided a visual chart AND told the reader about the monetary gains. . That&rsquo;s two&nbsp;presentations. . How else could the copywriter &ldquo;show&rdquo; the reader how much money they were getting? . A good copywriter will try reframe proof often. . Continuing the previous example&hellip; . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . Use my proprietary system to collect that much every month and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a reframe. . I changed the frame from a one-time $10,000 win into a &ldquo;yearly income.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not difficult, see? . All you need to do for a reframe is present a new perspective on the same information. . Another easy way for a copywriter to reframe their proof is just to make a simple, relatable comparison. . Let&rsquo;s try another. . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . That&rsquo;s 765 times more money that what you would have made sticking your money in the S&amp;P 500 for the entire year!&rdquo; . When a copywriter reframes their proof, they are making the proof &ldquo;three-dimensional.&rdquo; In a reader&rsquo;s mind, it becomes more tangible. &nbsp;More real. . When you start to binge copywriting, you will now translate this reframe pattern constantly&hellip; . As a result, you&rsquo;ll start to see new and clever ways to reframe simple pieces of proof. . Showing the Reader The Benefit . Everyone always says, talk about benefits over features. . Finally, here&rsquo;s a copywriter&rsquo;s big chance. . Step 1: They&rsquo;ve anticipated the objection&hellip; . Step 2: They&rsquo;ve stated a claim that combats the objection&hellip; . Step 3: They&rsquo;ve presented three pieces of proof that support the claim AND reframed each to make them three-dimensional&hellip; . Now it&rsquo;s time to talk benefits. . Here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d do it: . Continuing our example after our third piece of proof&hellip; . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . Make that much every month with this system and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income! Won&rsquo;t you be the talk of the town? . Imagine it&hellip; . People will whisper about you, &lsquo;how did he afford that fancy new car?&rsquo; . &lsquo;Did you see his new pool?&rsquo; . &lsquo;What about that trip to Italy he took his family on! Where did he get ALL THAT MONEY?&rsquo;&rdquo; . In this example, I didn&rsquo;t state the benefits directly at the reader. . I &ldquo;showed&rdquo; him the benefits in action. . I showed him the life he could have. . A very easy way a copywriter can illustrate (show don&rsquo;t tell) the benefits to the reader is simply by writing the word: &ldquo;Imagine&hellip;&rdquo; . And then write out whatever the reader would enjoy imagining. . &ldquo;Imagine the look on your friend&rsquo;s faces when you knock 10 strokes off your golf game.&rdquo; . &ldquo;Imagine sleeping easy every night because our debt consolidation service lowered your payments by hundreds of dollars a month.&rdquo; . To keep the copy fresh and avoid an echo&hellip; . A copywriter can just erase the word &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; and tell the reader about the benefits they&rsquo;ll experience. . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll speak with confidence and make friends easily after attending this public speaking class.&rdquo; . A Dark Tip About Benefits . Let me share something with you that I have found to be universally true. . Things that people consider the most personal, are actually the most common. . That is, everyone&rsquo;s personal shame is EVERYONE&rsquo;S personal shame. . Are you jealous of your successful, beautiful best friend who has had it so easy their whole life? . So is everyone else. . Do you resent how you allowed yourself to be manipulated in your last relationship&hellip; . or all your relationships? . So does everyone else. . Do you think you are unlovable for something that you did or happened to you years ago? . Unfortunately, so do most people. . And maybe not all of these apply to you&hellip; . But it is a hell of a bountiful place to start when thinking up how you&rsquo;ll describe benefits. . Everyone wants relief from their fears and frustrations. . They want to stick it to their smug brother in law&hellip; . Or their controlling father&hellip; . Or their Math teacher who said they wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything. . Everyone wants to be somebody. . Everyone wants to feel loved, special, and important. . Everyone wants a life of leisure and pleasure. . The truth is&hellip; . Those things that everyone thinks are most personal and private&hellip; . Are actually the most universal. . Ugly truths we don&rsquo;t want to face about our natures. . But hey, that&rsquo;s just part of being human. . The Seven Deadly Benefits . Another way to think about this &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of benefits stuff, is to consider the seven deadly sins. . Lust | Gluttony | Greed | Sloth | Wrath | Envy | Pride | People want a life full of this stuff. . That&rsquo;s why they buy things. . They want a solution that makes things easier so they can lounge around. . They want something to make them RICH so they can lord it over their judgmental father in law&hellip; . They want to have a better golf game because they want to have some dignity (pride) when they play beside their skilled friends. . When you think of presenting benefits from these sort of &ldquo;dark&rdquo; places&hellip; . Then you&rsquo;ll be able to paint a most beautiful picture for your reader. . Now when you see the word &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; in a piece of copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll immediately translate the words following as the copywriter&rsquo;s presentation of benefits&hellip; . And maybe even trace them directly to one of the seven deadly sins. . Examples of the Body Copy Template In Action . The first example is very special to me. . It&rsquo;s one of the first claims I ever wrote and proved in a sales letter. . I want you to pay attention to how simple this example is. . The structure is painfully obvious and elementary. . But it works! . As of today, this letter has been making me money every single day for about a year. . Here&rsquo;s the example, from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . You Need to Act Fast&hellip; Because Silicon Valley Insiders Are Getting Rich With Each Passing Day . You see, behind the scenes&hellip; . In the private market&hellip; . This company is already making some of my venture capitalist friends filthy rich. . For example, one of my friends who&rsquo;s a Silicon Valley insider (he asked me not to mention his name) says he turned $25,000 into nearly $60 million. . Bill Gurley, considered one of technology&rsquo;s top dealmakers, got in early&hellip; . and his investment grew 58,233% to over $7 billion! . Shark Tank guest Chris Sacca saw his investment soar 933,233%. &nbsp;His stake is now worth over $2.8 billion! . With those types of gains, a $1,000 investment would have made you over $9 million already! . That&rsquo;s crazy, right? . | . The Objection is:&nbsp;why should I act fast? . The claim is:&nbsp;Silicon Valley insiders are already getting rich. You&rsquo;re missing out. . The proof is: I provided three examples of rich investors as my three pieces of proof. . I wrote the benefit in turns of a small investment making you rich. . This is how simple copywriting can be for you. . Now let&rsquo;s look closer&hellip; . Because I&rsquo;m talking about James Altucher&rsquo;s &ldquo;venture capitalist friends&rdquo; it offers an exclusive &ldquo;insider&rdquo; look. . Triggering the Only emotion. . The $1,000 indicates it is Easy to get rich from this. . Because big name investors and prominent people are putting in their money, you can feel assured this isn&rsquo;t a scam. . SAFE. . And $1,000 turning into over $9 million? It doesn&rsquo;t get much Bigger than that. . Let&rsquo;s look at another example. . This example will be much more sophisticated because of my experience after a year of writing at Agora Financial. . This is proof presented in the form of a case study for Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass. . A Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week . This one secret move could not only supplement your retirement, but could bring in more money than your salary alone. . I&rsquo;m sure George was a little scared of trying something new... . Something outside the stock market, bonds, typical real estate or anything you might have heard before. . &ldquo;At first I was really skeptical. . I didn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; . But thanks to this little-known, one-time move&hellip; . George was able to immediately gross $96,000 in yearly income for himself and his family. . While I haven&#39;t had a chance to personally vet his financials&hellip; . Just imagine pocketing the equivalent of $1,846&hellip; every single week&hellip; for LIFE. . More money than most people collect from an entire month of Social Security. . And George says he only spends about an hour a week checking in on his income! . Which is about &ldquo;eight to nine thousand,&rdquo; he whispered in amazement. . Now George has a reliable way to keep making a lot of money in retirement&hellip; . George says his own family has a hard time believing his rapid success. . Because most folks have never heard of such a lucrative strategy as this. . | . The objection is: Will this be hard? . My claim is:&nbsp;&ldquo;A Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week.&rdquo; . My proof is:&nbsp;George&rsquo;s story. . He&rsquo;s a regular, skeptical guy who executed a little-known, one-time move to collect $96,000 in yearly income. . I asked the reader to imagine the benefits of $1,846 every single week for life. . I reframed the amount by comparing it to social security. . I also make sure to cover the Big 4 Emotions&hellip; . Inside my story I suggest George was trying something NEW. . I insist most people don&rsquo;t know this secret. . ONLY (New&rsquo;s alter ego) I do. . I tell the reader it is only a one-time move. . It doesn&rsquo;t require a ton of work. . It&rsquo;s EASY. . I address the reader&rsquo;s skepticism through George and his own shock. . Ensuring it is SAFE and ANYBODY (Easy&rsquo;s alter ego) can do it. . George&rsquo;s checks come in &ldquo;eight to nine thousand&rdquo; a month. . PREDICTABLE (Safe&rsquo;s alter ego) income. . And for a one-time move, eight to nine thousand a month is pretty damn BIG and FAST. . Rinse and repeat for the next section of the body copy. . Just remember to check off as many of the Big 4 boxes as possible. . The reader will be convinced. . Then all that&rsquo;s left to do is take their money. . Wrapping Up The Body Copy Template . There you have it&hellip; . When you look at nearly any piece of copy, particularly long-form&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll find that the very best performers in the world follow this simple step-by-step template in their body copy: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit | . The next time you read a piece of body copy, you should now be able to dissect virtually every line&hellip; . And you&rsquo;ll be able to easily translate each line to determine what stage the writer is at in their communication. . Are they communicating a claim that they want you to believe? . Are they communicating proof as to WHY you should believe them? Or are they communicating a benefit? . Are they showing you how, if you&rsquo;ll just listen to them, your wildest dreams will come true? . Seeing this pattern will become second nature to you, now that it is part of your copywriting lexicon. . And you&rsquo;ll be surprised how universal it is. . Common Sections in the Body Copy . Now that you know how to present your information, I&rsquo;m going to list some common sections in the body copy and go over them with you. . Sometimes these ideas are presented in the lead in a single line&hellip; . Then elaborated further in the body copy with an entire section following the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template. . The following list of sections aren&rsquo;t official definitions you&rsquo;ve read anywhere else in the world&hellip; . Because they are names I personally gave to patterns I recognized while translating literally thousands of pages of copy. . Better Than Section | The Last Time This Happened Section | Guru/Credibility Section | Discovery Story | Key Insight | Layman&rsquo;s Explanation | Technical Explanation | . The first two sections listed are a little unique. . Because it is common for these to be in the grey area that could be LEAD or body copy, depending on who you talk to. . But they do follow the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template. . Two Quick Tips for Building A Strong Lead And Starting the Body Copy With A Bang . There are two sections of copy I really like to include in a lead where I&rsquo;m presenting a large opportunity. . I typically use these two sections in a customer acquisition sales letter, or a &ldquo;front end&rdquo; promotion. . A front-end promotion is a low-priced offer of around $50 or less&hellip; . It&rsquo;s designed to get the customer to buy something from you and get into your customer list. . &nbsp;A back-end promotion is a high-priced offer of anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 or beyond&hellip; . It&rsquo;s designed to generate a ton of profits. . You don&rsquo;t need to know much more than that. . With what I&rsquo;ve taught you thus far, the next two sections should make sense&hellip; . And once you grasp the core concepts I show you, you&rsquo;ll be able to immediately translate these sections into what any copywriter is really trying to communicate. . The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section . The first section I call The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section&hellip; . And it is exactly what it sounds like! . After you hit all the core elements of a lead as explained above, you simply want to communicate the following message in a subhead&hellip; . &ldquo;This opportunity is &lsquo;better than&rsquo; the best, hottest thing out there right now.&rdquo; . Since I write financial copy, I love to go to something like Amazon or Facebook for this section. . For instance, FAANG stocks were all the rave in 2018. . Investors thought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google were the MUST HAVE stocks. . So, for a &ldquo;better than&rdquo; section I might say something like: . &ldquo;This single opportunity will deliver bigger profits than all the FAANG stocks put together!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my claim. . Then I would find a quote or figure about my opportunity from a news source&hellip; . One that would support the idea that you could make more with my opportunity than the FAANG stocks&hellip; . Then I might grab a chart or think of a comparison to draw&hellip; . And then one other piece of proof. . Bingo bango, that&rsquo;s one awesome &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section all done. . What Does A &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section Communicate? . The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section simultaneously builds the hype for your opportunity&hellip; . Which makes it perfect for around the lead&hellip; . While also selling the reader OUT of doing the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment. . Selling out of something basically means selling &ldquo;away&rdquo; from something&hellip; . It&rsquo;s the process of selling someone on NOT doing something else. . Because one objection the reader might have is, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just do this thing that&rsquo;s hot right now?&rdquo; . I recommend you knock that objection out early. . Now, which emotion I communicate is up to the angle of my claim and the proof I fetch. . For instance, if I say &ldquo;you can make more money with my opportunity than with FAANG stocks&hellip;&rdquo; . Then I am communicating my opportunity is BIG. . If I say my opportunity has consistently outperformed FAANG, I am communicating it is BIG and SAFE. . So pick and choose what you want to specifically communicate for your opportunity. . But no matter what: I MUST communicate one of The Big 4 or the section is worthless. . Here&rsquo;s an example of the Better Than section from The Hottest IPO and it will pick up where my last example left off&hellip; . With those types of gains, a $1,000 investment would have made you over $9 million already! . That&rsquo;s crazy, right? . That&rsquo;s Even Better Than Bitcoin . I don&rsquo;t know of any other asset that could grow your wealth so fast. . For example, the mainstream media likes to say that Bitcoin is the best performance asset in the entire world. . Sure, Bitcoin has minted tons of millionaires. . But this private company is making people even more money! . Over the last 12 months, Bitcoin has delivered around 800% returns for investors. . But we have seen over 900,000% gains from this private startup. . That&rsquo;s over 1,000 times higher than Bitcoin! . No wonder Business Insider calls this company &ldquo;the most valuable startup in the U.S. and across the globe.&rdquo; . | . When The Hottest IPO was written, Bitcoin was all the hype. . It was the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment I needed to sell away from. . When I re-wrote the lead of Hottest IPO for the $15 Trillion Gadget, it made sense to update my example. . Here is how the &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section was presented in the $15 Trillion Gadget. . . &nbsp; . The Second One I Call &ldquo;The Last Time Something Like This Happened&rdquo; (TLTSLTH) Section . This can go early in the copy, near the lead because it is a Big, hype-driven section. . To employ the TLTSLTH section, simply communicate the following message in a subhead: . &ldquo;The last time something like this happened was over 25 years ago!&rdquo; . Then I tell the story about what happened 25 years ago&hellip; . Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger. . &ldquo;The last time something like this opportunity happened, people became wildly happy!&rdquo; . So for something like financial copywriting, you might write something like: . &ldquo;The last time a tax bill like this was passed, millionaires were minted overnight.&rdquo; . Then you explain how people got rich from a similar opportunity&hellip; . Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger. . By showing a historical case study, I have introduced a pattern&hellip; . And therefore, Predictability. . The legendary Gary Halbert did this in his famous &ldquo;Water Ad.&rdquo; . WARNING: Do Not Read This Unless You Are Already Rich! . If you would like to know how someone can start with a simple idea... and then... generate over $51,000,000 in sales in just one year... this is going to be the most interesting message you will ever read. &nbsp;Here is why: &nbsp;There&#39;s a guy in California named Carl Palmer who, until recently, was very wealthy and very bored. &nbsp;He got rich (the first time) by starting a company in 1970 which he sold out to Coca-Cola just three years later in 1973. &nbsp; As part of the deal, he had to sign a &quot;non-compete&quot; agreement with a duration of five years. &nbsp;After that five years ended, he went back in business and built up another company which was soon acquired by the giant AMF Corporation. &nbsp;After that, Carl developed Shackley&#39;s reverse osmosis home water filtration system... and... in the first year... &nbsp;they did $51 million in sales with that product. &nbsp;And so on. &nbsp;You get the idea. &nbsp;What this guy does is, he comes up with enormously valuable inventions, starts a company to sell those inventions... &nbsp;and soon... he goes nuts with all the hassles of running a business... and so... &nbsp;he sells out (at a huge profit) to some giant corporation that has the resources and the clout to exploit the living daylights out of whatever it is he has invented. &nbsp;But now, he has outdone himself. &nbsp;Now, at the request of the Seychelle Technologies, Inc., he has invented something that is needed by every human being in the world... and... . This Invention Is Almost Certain To Generate Billions In Sales! . | . Pay attention to how Halbert explains the pattern between &ldquo;You get the idea&rdquo; and &ldquo;But now, he has outdone himself.&rdquo; . This is a huge booster for the Safe emotion because it creates a very valuable and Predictable pattern for the reader to believe in&hellip; . Knowing this, you should be able to immediately translate what it is copywriters are REALLY trying to communicate when they explain history to you. . The Guru/Credibility Section . The Guru or &ldquo;Credibility&rdquo; section is pretty much ubiquitous in all pieces of copy&hellip; . It&rsquo;s also where I draw a hard, black and white line for transition from the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;body copy.&rdquo; . When you see the credibility section, you are officially in the body copy. . The credibility section is designed to overcome the &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why should I listen to you?&rdquo; objections. . So while you are binging and translating copywriting you&rsquo;ll notice the credibility section communicates: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo; . That is the copywriter&rsquo;s claim: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo; . Generally, the copywriter will introduce the guru and then list some reasons the guru is credible. . That can include photos with prominent, credible people&hellip; . A list of appearances on authority sources, like being on TV and news networks&hellip; . Or a track record of success or accurate predictions. . Usually, you won&rsquo;t see case studies or testimonials at this point. . Those are mostly reserved for the Offer Copy, which we will cover in a little bit. . Here&rsquo;s an example Guru Section from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . Notice the variety of sources that really show the reader: &ldquo;James Altucher is a very credible guy you should listen to!&rdquo; . . . &nbsp; . The Discovery Story . The discovery story or &ldquo;key insight&rdquo; section usually tells the story of how the guru came across this breakthrough opportunity. . It addresses the objection: &ldquo;how do you know about this?&rdquo; . And usually communicates some element of New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . That is, the story could be about a key piece of information gathered from a secret source&hellip; . Or some elite network&hellip; . The proof would simply be offering proof such a relationship exists between the guru and the secret source. . Made Up Example: . Here&rsquo;s a made up example off the top of my head, and we will build on this in the coming sections&hellip; . &ldquo;As you know, I have worked on government projects before. . And on one of these projects I overheard a secret meeting. . Afterward, I approached one of the men and asked him about it, and what he shared with me blew my mind. . I can&rsquo;t tell you all the details here&hellip; . All you need to know is this is the most explosive opportunity I&rsquo;ve ever come across.&rdquo; . This example lets the reader know there is a secret government opportunity only our guru knows about. . So you just want to communicate that this information is not available to the whole world. . In fact, it was by chance that our guru luckily discovered this opportunity, thanks to his personal circumstances. . That&rsquo;s Big 4 Emotion New/&ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how we did that for The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Then the writer can transition into the key insight section. . The Key Insight . The key insight is the single piece (or pieces) of information the reader must know to be true in order to believe the opportunity is real. . Continuing the Made-Up Example: . Let&rsquo;s expand upon our made-up secret government opportunity from earlier&hellip; . &ldquo;The mysterious man told me about a secret government contract with major chip manufacturers around the world that would set up a $250 billion industry.&rdquo; . How can you make the reader believe this is true? . The writer can back this big claim up with proof using &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of things to come. . The writing is on the wall so to speak. (Safe/Predictable) . A writer may say something like&hellip; . &ldquo;Even though everyone has been kept hush hush, several prominent chip companies have quietly enjoyed explosion in their stocks recently. . That&rsquo;s because the insiders know what&rsquo;s happening and they&rsquo;re pouring in money now.&rdquo; . Again I&rsquo;m just making all this up. . But because I speak the language of copywriting&hellip; . I know what message I must communicate, and it just flows from my fingers. . I just need to tell you that I know one important piece of information that is setting up something big. . Then I write what that might sound like. . My skills have sharpened from binging copywriting. . And now the patterns have become so obvious to me, almost to the point of being dull. . It took me about a year to learn and develop this method. . And now, thanks to this guide, you&rsquo;ll be able to speak the copywriting language in no time&hellip; . And replicate my skill in a matter of weeks. . Real copy example: . Here&rsquo;s a real example of how we used our key piece of information about &ldquo;IBM&rsquo;s announcement&rdquo; in 70 Cent Crypto: . . The reader must understand that IBM is on board with this crypto and that their involvement is what will cause this whole opportunity to work. . I backed that claim up with examples of old announcements for other cryptos that took place before a crypto exploded in price. . Another challenge in this promo was convincing the reader that Bitcoin was on its way out, and our coin was the better coin. . Here&rsquo;s the key insight we used to prove that point: . . The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation . The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation addresses the objection: &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; . But the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is only one part of addressing that objection&hellip; . More on that in a moment. . Basically, The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is where you&rsquo;ll explain how the opportunity functions&hellip; . And do so in a way that two people half-drunk at the bar would be able to explain it to each other. . This is a cousin of the key insight. . Remember the Big 4 emotions when creating The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation. . So, picture two people hunched over at the bar. . Their faces are red and their eyes are half-closed from drinking too much. . Person 1 says to Person 2, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bunch of bullshit. . You&rsquo;ll believe anything you read online.&rdquo; What Person 2 says in reply IS the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation section. . If it&rsquo;s a system you&rsquo;re selling, the drunkard will reply with something like&hellip; . &ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple. You just follow these three steps and BAM. Success. . Listen, the secret is the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. . It&rsquo;s this new thing scientists discovered that makes the whole thing work. &nbsp; . I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. &nbsp;Until I heard about that &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; . I&rsquo;m telling you... &nbsp;This is the real deal.&rdquo; . . If it is our government contract example I just made up above, Person 2&rsquo;s reply would be something like: . &ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple. . Ya know how the government spends billions of dollars every year on war? . Well now there&rsquo;s a NEW sector and it&rsquo;s WAY cheaper than the old way... . So the government is going all in RIGHT NOW! I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. . They got these computers now that can do 500 times what the old technology did and at a fraction of the cost! . I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. Until I heard about that new sector. . I&rsquo;m telling you&hellip; This is the real deal.&rdquo; . . Again, I&rsquo;m totally making all this stuff up on the spot. . I know I must communicate a SIMPLE key piece of information that a person falling over drunk could communicate to a skeptical friend at the bar. . That&rsquo;s what I call: &ldquo;The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation: . . If you were drunk at the bar with a friend&hellip; could you explain this to them? . &ldquo;This dude has this secret formula&hellip; or crazy algorithm&hellip; . And it PREDICTS the stock market. &nbsp;I know, it sounds crazy. But it was over 90% accurate!&rdquo; . Even though the copywriter talks a bunch of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; about the algorithm in the above section, he doesn&rsquo;t really tell you how it works&hellip; . Just that &ldquo;it works.&rdquo; . The Technical Explanation . The Technical Explanation is just the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation dressed up in a lab coat with glasses. . If it were a system I were selling, I would go into crazy detail about the science behind the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; . So much detail as to fly over the head of the reader. . And that is by design. . For instance, I could present the complicated scientific formula that makes it all work. . This communicates, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smarter than you. &nbsp;Trust me.&rdquo; . For the made-up government contracts example we have above, I could talk about computer chips in more detail. . I could mention the microns and nanosecond reaction times or something. . Here&rsquo;s how they did it in The Money Zone: . . The copywriter is throwing so much jargon and technical stuff at the reader so they will think to themselves, &ldquo;Okay, okay, I don&rsquo;t understand any of this stuff. I&rsquo;m not a computer genius. Whatever.&rdquo; . Even though the reader doesn&rsquo;t actually want to know or learn this complicated stuff, they want reassurance the guru DOES know it. . Safe/Predictable. . Wrapping Up The Body Copy . You now know some of the most common elements of the body copy section in a piece of copy. . The stuff you&rsquo;ve learned is verypowerful. . I must confess that I am feeling a desire to invest in one of those government contract chip companies we made up&hellip; . Even though I KNOW logically, that I just made all that stuff up about a new &ldquo;sector&rdquo; and government opportunity . I know, logically, that opportunity doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; . But my emotions are not rational. . They do not understand logic. . They are reactive, and the words I typed in the make-believe examples are emotionally exciting. . The language of copywriting is communicated purely through subtext. . The language of copywriting isn&rsquo;t about what is said, it is about what is communicated. . The things REALLY being communicating by a skilled copywriter will bypass the reader&rsquo;s rational, logical levels of the brain&hellip; . And go directly to pulling their emotional strings. . In learning how to translate that language yourself&hellip; . You are learning how to communicate directly to a human being&rsquo;s emotional and core desires. . Section 4: The Offer . Hooray, we&rsquo;ve made it to the offer! . It&rsquo;s all downhill from here&hellip; sort of. . Generally, the offer section in long form direct response copy occupies the last twenty to thirty percent of the text. . It&rsquo;s very similar to the format of any &ldquo;free webinar&rdquo; you might have attended. . You get about 45 minutes of content&hellip; . Followed by a 15-minute pitch&hellip; . And sometimes, if the webinar host is feeling generous, you get about 30-40 minutes Q&amp;A. . Frankly, it&rsquo;s no different in copywriting&hellip; . Because webinars are based on high performing sales techniques and often scripted by copywriters! . What To Look For In An Offer . A ton of information must be conveyed quickly and directly in an offer&hellip; . This is the part of your copy where you will be asking a reader to whip out their credit card, so you want to make sure they have NO reason not to&hellip; . That means being crystal clear with details and instructions for them to follow. . Here are the most common elements that make up the offer section: . Summarize everything discussed so far | Intro report | Intro service | The unique selling proposition | How it works / What to expect / What you get | Pump in some cred | . Add bonuses | Share testimonials | Recap | Offer guarantee | Limit the Spots or Quantity | Set a deadline | Ask for sale | . These do not have to be presented in a specific order&hellip; . But the order I&rsquo;ve presented above is pretty clean and effective. . Remember to keep the Big 4 top of mind when writing every word of your copy&hellip; . Even the offer section. . Because directly stating information about something, is NOT copywriting. . That is educating... . That&rsquo;s a blog post. . If you are telling, you aren&rsquo;t selling. . So there is an art that comes in conveying your information and instruction&hellip;. . While continuing to SELL them on the offer section. . The persuasive message must continue to be subtly communicated, while being intertwined with the information. . Don&rsquo;t skip over that part&hellip; . Because that is &ldquo;the copywriting part.&rdquo; . I hope you&rsquo;re excited to learn how to structure and create a compelling offer in this section. . Once you learn to spot these patterns in the copy, and tease out what a copywriter is really communicating&hellip; . You will be able to write your own offer copy with ease. . A Membership or Subscription Service Is One of the Most Complicated Offers . The reason membership and subscription offers are so complicated is because the SELLER is usually selling a subscription&hellip; . While the BUYER is usually interested in buying into the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; or &ldquo;system&rdquo; that has been teased throughout the copy. . As such, the offer section will require an introduction of both the &ldquo;report&rdquo; that explains the opportunity&hellip; . And then must also introduce the subscription service itself. . So let&rsquo;s take my government contract example I made up earlier. . I&rsquo;ve explained to you there is a huge opportunity to profit off these secret government contracts&hellip; . And I&rsquo;ve put all the details for you in a nice little report. . The report is called, Report X. . Guess what? Report X is free. . Here are the details inside: x&hellip; y&hellip; and z&hellip; . i.e. &ldquo;Inside you&rsquo;ll learn: Exactly how to profit, what ticker symbol to invest in, and my sophisticated, full research.&rdquo; . The report will reveal everything the reader desperately wants to know that was only teased in the sales letter. . But the objective of the copywriter is to get a new subscriber&hellip; . So they might write something like: . &ldquo;But in order to receive the free report, you must subscribe to my newsletter or membership service, &lsquo;The ABC Club&rsquo; for $49 per year.&rdquo; . Get it now? I&rsquo;m actually selling the subscription service. . That just adds a slight wrinkle to information you must convey in the offer. . But it&rsquo;s no big deal. . You can use a similar setup for anything else you&rsquo;re selling. . If I&rsquo;m selling basketball training&hellip; . I could write an entire sales letter about, “The one secret to being a better basketball player than Lebron James.” . I could talk about that one secret the whole time. . I could illustrate how it is New, Safe, Easy, and Big. . Then say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the secret when you join my basketball training club.&rdquo; . Until the offer section, the reader may have never known there was a club! . And that&rsquo;s okay. . It&rsquo;s up to you what items you select to highlight in your copy... . You may want to test a couple angles and find the best performing one, then ditch the others. . Here&rsquo;s an example of introducing the report and subscription service from The 70 Cent Crypto. . . There&rsquo;s a lot happening in this example. . Let&rsquo;s just focus on the report and subscription service. . At the top we introduce the information the reader wants, using a dossier: The $.70 Crypto That Could Make You Rich in 2018. . At the bottom we introduce the subscription service that will grant you access. . Then we explain that in order to get the dossier, you must join the subscription service: . . Working Backwards and Building Your Offer . In just a second we&rsquo;ll dive full into the elements of an offer section&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll see exactly what information you must tell&hellip; . But I want to remind you about the most important aspect about the language of copywriting. . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . You&rsquo;ll be happy to know, there are still only 4 main things you&rsquo;ll want to keep top of mind when writing an offer: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast | . So when you&rsquo;re reading an offer by a master copywriter, see if you can recognize examples of them weaving the Big 4 (and their alter-egos) into the information to make it more exciting. . Okay, I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting long enough&hellip; . Let&rsquo;s dive into the elements of typical offer copy. . Summarize Everything Discussed Before . In the lesson on body copy, you learned that body copy follows a typical structure of: Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit format. . Once one claim is proven and the benefits presented, there is an opportunity for the copywriter to weave in a quick reminder about the opportunity before moving on and presenting a new claim in the next section. . That&rsquo;s why the following part of the offer copy should stick out like a sore thumb&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll notice you are about 70 percent through the copy and it seems like you&rsquo;re re-reading the lead all over again. . No new information is being presented&hellip; . No new claim is being proven&hellip; . At this point your brain will see the pattern: You know you are reaching the offer copy. . In a moment, the writer will present you with the opportunity to &ldquo;get in&rdquo; on what he&rsquo;s been hyping up, via some product offer or report. . So in order to get you in the state of mind to badly want that thing (usually a report)&hellip; . He is going to use the same hype from the lead to get you hype again. . This part will be similar to the lead. . Sometimes instead of presenting claims, the writer will suggest he has fulfilled all their claims from earlier. . Like this: . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the proof that X Claim is happening&hellip; I&rsquo;ve shown you the proof about Y Claim. . And now you can get the details in X Report.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Here it is in The Hottest IPO: . . Intro Report . See how easily that flowed? . We recapped, rebuilt the hype that caused you to read in the first place, then presented you with an opportunity to &ldquo;get in.&rdquo; . You&rsquo;ll also notice, we REALLY jack up the urgency as we get closer and closer to the close of the letter. . More on urgency in a moment. . When you see a copywriter intro the report, you&rsquo;ll notice the copywriter doesn&rsquo;t give away the specifics inside. . Instead, they tell you about the information you, the reader, hope to get from inside. . &ldquo;Once you have this report, it will only take you 5 minutes and 3 clicks of your mouse to get in front of this life-changing opportunity!&rdquo; . Notice that in this made-up example, I don&rsquo;t go into boring details inside the report. . Instead, I stick to my core emotions, the Big 4 Emotions. . This particular line, I highlight how easy, fast, and big this all is. . And the fact that they don&rsquo;t know the information in my report and I am holding it, triggers New/Only. . Bam. All four hit. . And I didn&rsquo;t give away anything. . Not only is withholding the details MORE effective&hellip; . Divulging the details is INEFFECTIVE and actually HARMFUL. . There&rsquo;s two reasons for that. . Information is not sexy | The reader may believe they have this &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo; | Point one: Information is not sexy. . The human brain cannot deal with raw data. . Sure, it can solve problems and calculate things&hellip; . But it cannot come to an emotional or motivated conclusion based on facts. . It needs a story to guide that motivation. . That&rsquo;s what copywriting is. . So always remember&hellip; . Even though the reader wants this information, BADLY even&hellip; . Giving it to them will NOT work. . Because it is not scientifically possible to excite them to action with raw data. . If you activate their calculating, analytical part of the brain, even for a moment, that kills all the momentum you&rsquo;ve built. . In fact, make sure that you are mostly presenting stories in your body copy too. . Never just use raw data as proof. . As for the second point: the reader cannot be allowed to think they have your secret &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo; . &nbsp;The moment they think, “Oh I think I know what this secret is… I can do this on my own…” . ...Then they are gone. . They&rsquo;ll either try to do it on their own&hellip; . Or they will try and find another version of your secret for cheaper, if they think they know what your thing is. . You must never allow your opportunity to be categorized as a commodity. . If that happens, it&rsquo;s &nbsp;over. . On that note: You can keep your report from being &ldquo;another boring old report&rdquo; by calling it something else. . Anything else! . Dossier, Bulletin, Hot Sheet, Guide, Manual. . These are just a few quick examples. . You&rsquo;ll notice we called the report in The 70 Cent Crypto a &ldquo;dossier.&rdquo; . And we called the Pre-IPO Prospectus a &ldquo;prospectus.&rdquo; . But I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to write. . That would not serve you. . Writing copy is not a &ldquo;how to.&rdquo; . Instead, you must binge on copy, translate out the subtext, and then you&rsquo;ll know what to look for when you see another writer Intro the Report in their offer section. . After seeing a couple examples, you&rsquo;ll quickly come up with New, unique names for your own report with a little bit of thought. . You&rsquo;ll see ways to weave New, Safe, Easy, and Big into your report tease. . At this point, the copywriter has summarized the exciting stuff&hellip; . Introduced their report and teased some key information&hellip; . And now they&rsquo;ll drop a line like: . &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . Or&hellip; . &ldquo;As soon as you RSVP your spot in my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . . Intro The Service . This is the real offer you want to the reader to take&hellip; . A quick note about the &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; line&hellip; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; . As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . Usually the words trial offer only appear in front end products, where the price is $49 and they can get their money back if unsatisfied. . The words &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t usually appear in back end offers&hellip; . Because back end offers are priced at $2,000 and above&hellip; . And you don&rsquo;t want the customer to buy, steal the information in the report, and then ask for a refund. . So most folks do not offer a &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; for back ends. . Many folks do not offer refunds for back ends at all. . You&rsquo;ve seen examples of how a writer might introduce the report and then the service&hellip; . And you&rsquo;ll pick up more as you binge copy. . So now what? . Now it&rsquo;s time to sell the service itself. . The first thing to do&hellip; . Explain the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) . The unique selling proposition is what makes your service DIFFERENT. . The USP will trigger New/Only for your reader and your presentation can be pretty straight forward: . “The only service that...” . ...and you say the logical thing that comes to mind. . It may be the only service that uses the special system you&rsquo;ve been teasing. . Or the only service that does things the special way they do&hellip; . Or has the special people involved that are involved. . It just has to be &ldquo;unique&rdquo; to be a unique selling proposition. . One thing that is important, and many people get hung up on... . Your USP doesn&rsquo;t even have to be THAT &ldquo;unique.&rdquo; . Sounds like I&rsquo;m contradicting myself now, huh? . So there are three ways to create a USP. . Have something actually unique | Label something common as unique | Give something &ldquo;old&rdquo; a new name | Actually Unique . You can use something truly unique, like a proprietary formula or patented technology or process&hellip; . Label Something Common as Unique . Or you can highlight something COMMON about your product that nobody else has highlighted before. . A classic example comes from a company that was having trouble selling fire alarms. . They brought on a copywriter who asked how the alarms were made. . After going over how the alarms were made, the copywriter said, &ldquo;These connectors are gold plated. . We should sell that.&rdquo; . The manufacturer said, &ldquo;all company&rsquo;s connectors are gold plated.&rdquo; . The copywriter said, &ldquo;but nobody is talking about it!&rdquo; . I got that story from Joseph Sugarman&rsquo;s Adweek Copywriting Handbook, I believe. . Give Something &ldquo;Old&rdquo; A New Name . The South Beach diet failed in its first several iterations because it was named &ldquo;The modified carbohydrate diet.&rdquo; . That was not new and not sexy. . So they called the same old thing something new, &ldquo;The South Beach Diet&rdquo; and bam, national success. . One more example&hellip; . The iPod was not an original idea. . There were TONS of MP3 players all over the market, made by a zillion manufacturers. . But Steve Jobs in his infinite wisdom decided to market the iPod as &ldquo;1,000 songs in your pocket.&rdquo; . All of a sudden, Apple&rsquo;s MP3 player was super unique and exciting. . It didn&rsquo;t play songs differently than any other MP3 player, but it sure was the most popular. . It will only take reading a handful of examples before you really spot this trend and quickly come up with your own ideas. . Another very common way to communicate the USP is to start a sentence with &ldquo;my mission with Service XYZ is to&hellip;&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how we did it in The Hottest IPO&hellip; . . Notice how we make The Altucher Report unique by labeling it the &ldquo;ONLY place where I&rsquo;ll personally update you on emerging new ways to earn more income and grow your wealth&hellip;&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone introduced their service and made it unique: . . How it Works / What to Expect / What You Get . The next thing you have to do once you have told the reader why your product is unique, is tell them what to expect from their experience. . You&rsquo;ll notice copywriters make it as clear as possible, answering questions like: What comes with this service or membership? . How often will I receive an email? . What will be in the emails? . Pro Tip: put a graphic of an actual email&hellip; . Presented like a sheet of paper with the letter head and text and everything&hellip; . That way the reader can see it, and it will help them recognize the format, the branding, and most importantly&hellip; . What to expect! . This is also a great time to include anything else that comes standard with the offer. . That could be special access to an exclusive website, a customer service number, or any other regular emails they might receive. . Because your competitors will probably be offering similar things, you will want to &ldquo;dress&rdquo; your standard offering &ldquo;up.&rdquo; . You&rsquo;ll see it in the copy while you&rsquo;re binging. . Call your report something weird. . Call your website something weird. . Instead of just saying, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s our customer service phone number,&rdquo; say something like, &ldquo;We have a dedicated team of specialists to support you for this project. Here&rsquo;s their number.&rdquo; . No matter where you are in the copy, every element should feel New. . When you are in the offer section, it is really tempting to just say, &ldquo;this is what you want, here it is&hellip;&rdquo; and just give them the information. . But you have to fight against that urge. . Even in the offer section, you should make every effort to keep the reader from thinking, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo; . And while making your offer, remember, specifics are key. . And in the specifics, you want to emphasize how EASY you&rsquo;ve made everything. . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll receive an email from me every Monday morning when the markets open.Inside I&rsquo;ll include commentary about the markets, one trade recommendation, and step by step instructions to execute that trade if you wish to invest.Everything you need to get in the trade is right there in the email, and you can be in any of these trades in mere minutes.You don&rsquo;t need a special brokerage account, any old one will do... . You don&rsquo;t need a specific amount of money, either.In fact, anybody can follow these simple instructions with just an internet connection and 10 minutes of time.&rdquo; . I just made all that up. . As someone who speaks the language of copy, I don&rsquo;t have to really consult any outside resources or think hard about this stuff. . I know I just need to make this part sound really EASY. . Because after thousands of hours binging copy&hellip; not reading ABOUT copy&hellip; . I have seen that all the great copywriters lean heavily on the Easy emotion in this section. . Now that you have learned this part of the offer, you&rsquo;ll see it too! . As you start to binge great copy on your own, it will only couple examples for you to instantly recognize creative ways writers make their offer section seem unique and exciting&hellip; . Then you&rsquo;ll be able to write your own with ease. . The Money Zone promo did a terrific job at this: . . Pump in Some Cred . There is no specific spot to drop this&hellip; . But now is a good time to remind the reader of the guru&rsquo;s credibility before moving onto bonuses. . Something like a quick look at the track record or appearances on TV will do. . Not testimonials, though. . Weave testimonials in between bonuses or save them for after. . The Money Zone does this right before they go into bonuses: . . Add Bonuses . At this point the reader knows what they are getting and how it will work. . And right after that, many great copywriters &ldquo;spice up&rdquo; their offer with some cool bonuses. . Bonuses can be anything, really. . Consider bonuses as cherries on top of your big opportunity. . Let&rsquo;s consider my make-believe government contracts example... . We are offering a big free report for the opportunity. . The report reveals the stock of a computer chip manufacturer that will profit huge from a secret government contract. . This will give investors a ton of money overnight. . So I could offer a bonus report about another profitable investing sector where the government has big, profitable contracts. . Or I could offer a bonus report about other investing sectors that will benefit from the computer chips themselves. . Or I could send them some sort of physical product&hellip; . Like a free laptop that contains the very computer chip the company makes! . Generally, you should make your bonuses related to your big opportunity. . In my personal opinion, tacking on random unrelated bonuses subtracts from the strength of your original offer. . You wouldn&rsquo;t want to tack a &ldquo;how to buy gold&rdquo; bonus at the end of your cryptocurrency letter. . (These two are basically at polar opposite ends of the investing ideology pole) . That&rsquo;s probably the only rule I would put on bonuses. . You might think, &ldquo;Why would anybody do that?&rdquo; . The quick answer is: because it&rsquo;s easy. . Sometimes people have leftover bonuses or free software they can bundle and throw in with their offer. . So they just bundle a bunch of random stuff and throw it at the reader. . Again, to me, that just cheapens your original pitch. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s my two cents. . Just try to get creative when you can. &nbsp;There is a lack of creativity in this world. . Keep your eyes peeled for creative bonuses while you&rsquo;re binging copy. . In Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass, we tried to include bonuses that went along with our theme of safe, predictable income. . We offered a bonus report called - &ldquo;The Recession Proof Portfolio: Five Assets That NEVER Go Out of Style.&rdquo; . . Testimonials . The key for good testimonials, is to try and mimic the reader as much as possible in their presentation. . That includes mirroring your target market&rsquo;s physical features in images, and their economic and life status where you can. . Even locations where you know your target market might be concentrated. . A quick and easy way to mimic your reader is by using photos, even stock photos will do, of people who should resemble your ideal reader. . If you are writing mostly for old white men, find some images of old white men to plug in beside the testimonials. . If you are writing for young female yoga enthusiasts, find some images of young ladies performing yoga. . For all graphics, if you didn&rsquo;t PAY for them - make sure to only use royalty free images and/or images labeled for commercial use. . Basically, don&rsquo;t grab random images off Google. . That&rsquo;s an easy way to get in trouble. . The best testimonials include the most specifics. . Example 1: &ldquo;This service is great!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a pretty cool testimonial. . But let&rsquo;s look at one (made up example) with more specifics&hellip; . Example 2: &ldquo;I had $65 to my name. I spent $49 on Guru A&rsquo;s service. &nbsp;My mom, who I was living with, thought I was crazy. &nbsp;I memorized everything in Guru A&rsquo;s book and employed every step in chapters 2-4, verbatim. Two weeks later I was a millionaire. &nbsp;Thank god for Guru A. They changed my life.&rdquo; . The more details in the testimonial, the greater chance for the Big 4 to be weaved into them. . From this example above we can see that the opportunity to follow Guru A is Big, Fast, Easy, Safe, and Anybody could do it. . So if you have testimonials, look at the long ones. . Here&rsquo;s a great testimonial we used in Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass: . . Gathering Testimonials . If you don&rsquo;t have a list of testimonials ready to go, that&rsquo;s okay too. . First, think of the perfect story you&rsquo;d want to hear in your testimonial, then ask 3-5 open-ended questions that guide your reader to tell that story. . If you want them to say something like: . &ldquo;I made a ton of money thanks to Guru A in just a couple weeks! I invested in stock xyz as soon as they said to and boom! I made $6,000! I highly recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a stellar testimonial . To get a response like that, you might ask these basic, guided questions: . Did you make a lot of money thanks to Guru A? | How much money and how fast did you do it? | How did you do it? | Would you recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service? | . Remember, Safe is our big emotion with testimonials&hellip; . So the more specifics you include, the more you talk about how the reader followed the guru&rsquo;s instructions and won, the more real and safe the testimonial will feel. . When you are binging copywriting and come to the testimonials section, you can translate the testimonials into useful questions that you can use yourself. . Recap The Offer So Far . The copywriter will have covered a lot of stuff in their offer by this point. . And the testimonials will have answered the reader&rsquo;s most pressing questions about whether this could work for them or not&hellip; . Which will make the reader feel Safe. . So they&rsquo;re excited. . Now it&rsquo;s time to make this deal feel larger than life. . You can do that quickly with a strong recap section. . Generally, a recap will be a rapid fire, bullet driven list. . Before we talk about what to say, let&rsquo;s talk about what you&rsquo;re communicating. . You&rsquo;re communicating that this offer contains an intense amount of value. . It&rsquo;s BIG. . An easy way to execute this is with a price anchor. . Before we get to the price anchor, let&rsquo;s look at some recap sections&hellip; . Here&rsquo;s how we did it for a front end product: The Hottest IPO. . Notice how we bullet out each piece of our offer and tease a little bit of information&hellip; . . Also take note of how we total up the values at the end and stack images to make the offer seem BIG! . Now take a look at this recap section from The Money Zone, which is a more expensive back end product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . For the Money Zone sales letter, no price for the product is ever stated in the letter &ndash; so they don&rsquo;t tie values to pieces of the offer on the sales page. . Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about a couple ways to set a price anchor. . The Price Anchor . The price anchor is just the psychological starting point for how much an offer is &ldquo;really worth.&rdquo; . Like a negotiation, the higher you can drive this number up at the start, the better. . This is really easy to do in a bullet driven recap like we did in The Hottest IPO&hellip; . Cover all the things that come standard with the offer. . Give each piece its own bullet with a little bit of detail added. . In as few words as possible, explain what they can expect and how simple it all is&hellip; . Cover all the bonuses offered, and tease some of the information inside. . And here&rsquo;s the little trick: Beside each bullet, assign a value. . &ldquo;My exclusive Pre-IPO Prospectus&hellip;: ($199 Value)&rdquo;. . When you reach the end of your bullets, you can sum up all of your stuff and say something like, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an $8,414 value!&rdquo; . That creates what is known as a price anchor. . Then you can say, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t pay anywhere near that today&hellip; . In fact, you won&rsquo;t even pay HALF that. . You can have all this incredible value, $8,414 worth, for just $49.&rdquo; . Which brings me to&hellip; . A word of caution on your price anchor&hellip; . You may have gotten the sense that $8,414 for just $49 is a little bit of&hellip; well, bullshit. . That&rsquo;s over a 99% reduction. . Nobody would ever deliver that much value so cheap. . And that&rsquo;s a common reaction. . Instead of just telling you that earlier, I thought I&rsquo;d show you first&hellip; . There is a rule of thumb for your price anchor. . Try to keep the anchor from going over 20x the actual price. . We broke that rule on The Hottest IPO&hellip; . But it will be a lot easier for the reader to accept that your offer of $421 has been reduced down to $49&hellip; . Than an offer worth $8,414 being reduced all the way down to $49. . Then you can reframe this discount and make it BIG, without being ridiculous. . &ldquo;You can have this $421 value for the low, low rate of $49! . That&rsquo;s over 80% off the total value! And just a mere 13 cents a day&hellip; . A price that anyone could afford!&rdquo; . See how I was able to reframe that a couple different times? . As you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, each of these lessons offers you a new tool to build your copywriting fluency. . Once you speak the language of copy, and you binge it, it will just make sense to do all these things naturally! . Comparing Apples to Oranges . Aside from the recap section, another way to offer a price anchor is by comparing apples to oranges. . Think of it like comparing a McDonalds cheeseburger to a T-bone steak. . Here&rsquo;s a Real Example from The Buyout Millionaires Club promo at Agora Financial: . The only tool that can help you get ahead of big money moves&hellip; our backtests showed that this indicator could have given readers a chance to see gains like the historical examples I&rsquo;ve shown you already&hellip; . Gains like&hellip; . $27,000, $42,333 and even an extraordinary $95,833 in a Matter of DAYS . How much would that be worth to you? Before you answer, consider this&hellip; . When I used to run a hedge fund&hellip; . We used to charge something called the 2-and-20 fee structure&hellip; . Meaning you are charged a 2% management fee&hellip; . Remember how I said the One-Day Bonus Indicator showed it could deliver average returns totaling . $24,829 every 9 days? . That equates to $1,390,424 a year&hellip; . With gains like that&hellip; . Your fees would easily be over $250,000. . | . Before talking about how much a subscription to the newsletter will cost ($2,000)&hellip; . The copywriters first mention a cost of $250,000 for Wall Street fees. . Apples to oranges. . Offer a Guarantee . When you offer a guarantee, you are simply guaranteeing &ldquo;results.&rdquo; . And a guarantee does not mean you must give someone their money back. . A guarantee can offer anything. . Usually, for cheaper front end offers, a money-back guarantee is appropriate. . But for very expensive back end offers, where information is the product, a money back guarantee can spell disaster. . Because people can buy, download the content, then refund. . But, like I said, you can offer a guarantee without offering someone their money back. . For a financial copywriting back end, you may see a guarantee like this: . &ldquo;We guarantee the chance to see 10x your money or we&rsquo;ll work for free.&rdquo; . Also of note: these words don&rsquo;t guarantee you &ldquo;will&rdquo; make 10x&hellip; . They guarantee you the &ldquo;chance to see 10x your money.&rdquo; . This way if the reader never invests a dime, but the guru still does his job of selecting 10x stocks, then the guru doesn&rsquo;t owe the reader anything further. . Whether the readers invest in the guru&rsquo;s recommendations or not is their choice. . Next, let&rsquo;s look at the words: &ldquo;work for free.&rdquo; . Generally, the guarantee is backed by a second year of the service for free. . Meaning, if the service doesn&rsquo;t produce 10x returns in the portfolio, the second year of the service is free. . The first reaction everyone ALWAYS has to this guarantee is: &ldquo;Why would I want a free service that didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; . That question is tremendously valid&hellip; &nbsp;but apparently inconsequential. . Because financial publishers have been running promos with that guarantee for a long, long time with great success&hellip; so&hellip; there&rsquo;s that. . Here&rsquo;s our guarantee for The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Limit the Spots or Quantity (Scarcity) . I wrote this entire book and when I reached this point, I admit, I had a mini panic attack. . Because I thought I might have completely overlooked a critical fifth pillar to copywriting. . And I imagined I would look like a total fool with egg all over my face&hellip; . Even after saying again and again, &ldquo;All you need is these FOUR things.&rdquo; That potential &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; pillar&hellip; . Urgency&hellip; and its alter ego Scarcity. . Urgency/Scarcity &ndash; The FIFTH Pillar of Copywriting? . Oh my GOD! THERE&rsquo;S A FIFTH PILLAR NOW!? . Well, luckily, no. . While it is very powerful, I don&rsquo;t think I would label urgency as fundamental as The Big 4. . You see, when you are reading copy, I encourage you to perform active reading&hellip; . And dissect every line and try to understand which of The Big 4 the writer was trying to communicate. . Because if you can decode copywriting through active reading, you can binge. . And if you binge you&rsquo;ll recognize the patterns for how master copywriters communicate The Big 4. . Then you will be able to automatically recreate those patterns and communicate exactly what you want with ease. . And when looking at urgency, it doesn&rsquo;t fit the bill to join The Big 4. . Consider The Big 4 as a healthy, well-balanced, four-course meal&hellip; . And urgency is like hot sauce. . You splash it in on top. . Without The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll go hungry. . And without urgency, the meal just isn&rsquo;t as spicy. . Even with huge portions of just two or three of The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll survive. . Let&rsquo;s look at the reverse&hellip; . Think how hard a meal of just hot sauce would be to swallow. . That&rsquo;s your reader&rsquo;s relationship with urgency. . Little doses of urgency here and there go a long way. . Except in the &nbsp;offer section. . The offer section without urgency would be like a dry chicken wing without any sauce. . Follow me? . Okay, so I think you get it now. . Just remember that urgency is some date or deadline. . Some reason to act NOW. . (And as such, I think it is probably best categorized under &ldquo;Big&rdquo; instead of given its own pillar)&hellip; . Urgency&rsquo;s Alter Ego is Scarcity . Even though Urgency can&rsquo;t join The Big 4, it does have an alter-ego. . Urgency&rsquo;s alter ego is Scarcity. . While a deadline limits the time&hellip; . Scarcity takes another step and further limits the opportunity&rsquo;s QUANTITY. . Urgency says &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip;&rdquo; . But Scarcity says, &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip; if you still can.&rdquo; . It signals to the reader&hellip; Maybe there will still spots available for you. . Maybe not. . Who knows? . Because Scarcity is sort of a one-trick-pony that triggers a sensation of &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; when coupled with Urgency, it is more appropriately filed under New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; than as its own pillar. . Urgency and Scarcity are very powerful when wielded properly. . And while I think you can use them sparingly to great effect, they have a big role to play in the offer section. . Right before asking for the sale, it&rsquo;s very common to see the copywriter limit the spots available and the window of time to get into them. . The Money Zone does it right after the guarantee: . . Ask for the Sale . I said &ldquo;ask for the sale&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;close&rdquo; on purpose. . Here is a subtle nuance of psychology that most folks don&rsquo;t know about or practice&hellip; . When you close, you want to instruct the reader on what to do&hellip; . But you don&rsquo;t want to TELL them what to do. . And therein lies the nuance. . Instead, you present what is called a &ldquo;Crossroads Close.&rdquo; . Crossroads Close . The crossroads close positions the reader at a crossroads where he must choose a path. . The crossroads close will usually go like this&hellip; . &ldquo;You now have two choices. . You can choose to join me and make all this money / experience all these incredible benefits&hellip; . And have yourself a brand new, incredible life. . Or you can click away and go back to the life you&rsquo;ve had before reading this. . The life you&rsquo;ve always had.&rdquo; When phrased like that, it sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice. . Some folks offer a third choice, &ldquo;try to figure all this stuff out on your own, with no help&hellip; Even though it took me 10 years to figure it out and I&rsquo;m a professional.&rdquo; . But based on everything I&rsquo;ve seen in psychology papers, it is my opinion that the fewer choices, the better. . Why water down the contrast of the two original choices? . Anyways, when the reader looks at the original two choices it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice at all. . But it still is a choice. . That&rsquo;s the subtlety of it. . The reader is given the OPTION to be a stubborn ox and say &ldquo;no&hellip;&rdquo; . Even though it makes no logical sense to do so in the context of a crossroad close. . But a choice is all the reader wants. . Choice = autonomy. . The reader is still the master of their own destiny. . They know that even if they choose themselves into a pit of despair, they did it their way. . Look, nobody likes to be preached at... . Nobody likes to be told they must do something or buy something or else they are an idiot&hellip; . Even though many salesmen take the: &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to be an idiot to say no to this. . Don&rsquo;t even think about saying no, you dummy,&rdquo; approach. . At the end of the offer section the reader knows they are being sold&hellip; . Or they should know by now. . They know the Urgency and Scarcity is meant to push them. . And they want the freedom of autonomy. . The freedom to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; . So what does that look like in copy? Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did it: . . You&rsquo;ll see the writer present the crossroads close. . Then tell the reader the decision is totally theirs. . Of course while reinforcing how obvious the choice is. . Then at this point, the copywriter has done all he can do. . The copywriter will quickly sum up the opportunity, the urgency, the scarcity&hellip; . And then leave the reader to their final decision to click or not click. . The pitch is over. . Just the big, colorful button remains. . The P.S. and FAQ . Personally, I love to summarize the promo in a P.S. . directly after the sign off. . Sort of like its own abbreviated version of the lead. . Some copywriters like to drop an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) after the sign off. . The FAQ basically pulls out each individual objection, or the most common ones, and addresses them directly. . I&rsquo;m not a fan of FAQs. . For one, it&rsquo;s more work on the copywriter to re-answer questions that should have already been addressed in the copy. . Second, there is no flow or conversation control when it comes to an FAQ. . The way FAQs are written, question by question&hellip; . Allows the reader to freely jump around the page and scan from one question to the next. . In phone sales they say you need to control the conversation. . An FAQ takes that control away from the copywriter: the seller, who should control the conversation. . There is a natural and even forced breakage of attention from one idea to the next in an FAQ section. . And the inevitable repeating of information the reader has &ldquo;already seen before.&rdquo; . What&rsquo;s the point of writing a coherent, story-driven, sales letter that &ldquo;shows&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tells&hellip;&rdquo; Just to make a list that tells after it&rsquo;s all over? . Sure, the copywriter can weave sales messages into FAQ&hellip; . And I know of very successful sales letters with immense FAQ sections (Jim Rickards&rsquo; IMPACT System jumps into mind)&hellip; . But personally, I&rsquo;m not a fan. . Just write compelling copy and the FAQ becomes unnecessary. . You are free to write one if you want&hellip; . Completely your choice. . Wrapping Up The Offer Section . The offer section is chock full of important information. . I hope you noticed from the examples I&rsquo;ve presented&hellip; . And the lessons I&rsquo;ve established early and often in this guide&hellip; . That you must remember to keep The Big 4 top of mind in everything you write. . Even though it might seem like your reader &ldquo;just wants the information&hellip;&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get caught in that trap. . Especially when you&rsquo;re this close to the end. . Even though I have offered some form of structure for your offer section, keep the elements within unique. . Remember, categorization = DEATH. . &ldquo;New and novel&rdquo; is not just for your headline. . It&rsquo;s not just for your lead. . It applies to your body copy, and even your offer copy. . Conclusion . You now have the fundamentals to dissect and translate virtually any piece of copywriting or sales material you come across. . You might be looking at shorter copywriting&hellip; . Facebook ads&hellip; . Or emails&hellip; . Or you may be observing a live webinar that you can&rsquo;t read&hellip; . But these lessons should jump out at you anywhere anything is being sold. . The world should not look the same to you from here on. . Finishing this guide and finally closing it should feel like an awakening. . You can now &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . If the world doesn&rsquo;t look a little different, this guide did a poor job or you didn&rsquo;t need it. . You now understand that copywriting is not a &ldquo;how to&hellip;&rdquo; . It is a language, purely communicated through subtext. . The words do not matter, so much as what is subliminally communicated. . You know: . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . You know The Big 4 Emotions that must be communicated to stir your reader to action. | You know what to look for in a good headline&hellip; | You know about the 4&rsquo;Us. | You know the purpose and common elements of a lead&hellip; | You know how to structure your body copy. | You know the objection, claim, proof, benefit template. | You know what information must be conveyed in an offer... | . But to always remember to keep The Big 4 top of mind. . &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re telling, you aren&rsquo;t selling.&rdquo; . I thank you from the bottom of my heart if you&rsquo;ve read all the way to this line. . I wanted to create a guide that would help beginners get started on the right foot&hellip; . Offer veterans a fresh perspective on their craft&hellip; . And hopefully create a unique message and methodology to a craft that has been thoroughly covered and studied for generations. . I hope you got something out of this guide... . &nbsp; I&rsquo;m doing that thing where I ramble at the end&hellip; . Thanks so much for reading. . That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. .
