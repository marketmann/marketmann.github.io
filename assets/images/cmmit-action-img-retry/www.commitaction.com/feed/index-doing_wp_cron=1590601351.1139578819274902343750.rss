<p>This isn’t going to be another “me too” work-from-home guide. Unless you’ve been living in a cave, you probably know to get dressed like you’re going to the office and to take walks. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>(And if you have kids, you’re probably as sick as we are of gurus talking about how much more&nbsp; time you have to work on your business now!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This guide will be completely different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m Peter Shallard and I’m the founder of <strong>Commit Action</strong>. And I&#8217;m working from home just like you right now. Here&#8217;s my cobbled together setup that has nothing whatsoever to do with my actual focus and productivity: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/working-from-home.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3464" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div>



<p>What really makes the difference? For the last 6 years, the Commit Action team has conducted weekly one-to-one conversations with <strong>thousands</strong> of entrepreneurs working in varying states of isolation. We’ve collected data on their focus and productivity habits. </p>



<p>We know exactly what tactics for boosting effectiveness work best. &nbsp;</p>



<p><mark class="ghostkit-highlight">(If you want to know about how Commit Action’s service helps entrepreneurs, <a href="https://www.commitaction.com">click here</a>.)</mark></p>



<p><strong>This guide will break down three work-from-home mindset optimizations. </strong>These aren’t cutesy hacks, but mental shifts to your work process you can make each and every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Our data shows that thousands of entrepreneurs—across dozens of industries—have used these small mindset changes to successfully skyrocket their focus, performance and actual bottom line results.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Let’s get straight into the how-to…&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#1 Radically and strategically shorten your to-do list—both it’s total length AND it’s task size </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium is-resized"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3459" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-768x768.png 768w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_1-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>To-do lists and project plans as long as your arm correlate strongly with <strong>overwhelm and self sabotage. </strong>This is especially true for entrepreneurs faced with volatility and uncertainty — something we’re all living with right now. </p>



<p>A maximum of just <strong>three</strong> <strong>high-leverage priorities</strong> for the week is optimal. </p>



<p>These should be three tasks you have to execute that will drive growth in your business. Or at least give you the best odds of creating that growth. <br><br>It’s not that you can’t do more than three things each week. You simply need to decisively set three specific goals to move forward on your most important (and often scariest!) projects. The other stuff—the email, and small firefighting tasks—will still get done. <br><br><strong>Ask yourself what three chunks of work you have to complete in order to make the next seven days feel like a huge victory! </strong><br><br>The seven day horizon is the second key factor here. <br><br>You won’t be mentally optimized if you’re pushing yourself <em>hard, </em>today, on a task that won’t be able to get finished for six weeks.<br><br>The idea is that the human mind naturally deals with a certain size of goal or challenge <em>better than others</em>. You need to break your big projects into these “right size” chunks. <strong>If you fail to do this, you will notice a tendency to procrastinate and feel stressed about <em>starting</em> work every day. </strong> </p>



<p>To put these approaches together: </p>



<ul><li>Once a week, review your wider to-do list and project plans.&nbsp;</li><li>Pick three objectives, and jot down a specific sub-objective for each that is realistically achievable within the next seven days.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>By doing this, you have created an ultra focused short term objective set. You are following psychological best practices and your execution potential will skyrocket as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get to work and only look at your 7-day 3-objective plan, for the entire week. Other stuff will still get done, but those three mission critical objectives will benefit from your laser focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Fun Fact: The number three isn’t random: The US Military ran studies to assess what number of mission objectives was psychologically optimal for “in the field” performance during elite special forces missions. Three objectives conclusive showed up again and again as the best number for enhancing focus and execution.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>#2 Set appointments with yourself to do “deep work” </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3460" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2.png 6000w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2-768x768.png 768w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA_play_2-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>Have you ever wondered why—even with competing priorities, screaming kids and all the distractions in the world—you’re still showing up like clockwork for <em>scheduled</em> <em>video conference</em> <em>meetings</em>?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Human beings have a natural tendency to perform better—and be more committed—when an appointment is involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s partly due to the accountability of a third party (more on this in a second) but <strong>have you ever wondered why you expect yourself to do your most important work in the gaps left between time-wasting meetings?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It shouldn’t be that way. And for elite entrepreneurs, it isn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The highest performing business owners we’ve worked with all conditioned themselves to do the opposite: They avoid meetings like the plague but are <em>religious </em>about blocking out committed time to do deep work, each and every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The world’s most effective people treat work appointments they set with <em>themselves</em> as sacred.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The other truth our data shows is going to be a relief to hear: Even ultra successful entrepreneurs only spend 2-4 hours a day doing focused “in-the-zone” work. And that’s on a good day!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll surprise yourself by how much you’ll get done in even a 20 minute “deep work” session if you simply have these key pieces in place:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A clear objective for the work you’ll execute&nbsp;</li><li>A defined starting place to begin from</li></ul>



<p>This takes your most important, growth-driving and mission-critical work from something you do <em>when you feel like it… </em>and turns it into a scheduled work session you can <em>just show up to</em>. Like a professional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For overloaded parents, this approach is critical, because let’s face it: No one is doing a full eight hour work day uninterrupted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This technique puts bounded constraints around your work sessions and lets you bargain with your spouse and/or kids to carve out the time needed to execute.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Start carving our dedicated, project-specific sprint time on your actual calendar <em>now</em></strong>. If you’re a parent—or just extra prone to distraction—begin with 20 minute chunks and work your way up to an hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stop lying to yourself that your boldest projects—that rely solely on YOU executing—will happen in the little gaps here and there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schedule like you’re serious: The most important appointment on your calendar is the meeting between you… and your most important project.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Stack multiple layers of accountability to defeat the negative side-effects of isolation </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1v3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3461" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div>



<p>Human beings are social, political primates. As a species, we have thrived by developing sophisticated communication and team work strategies. Relationships with other humans were a tremendous advantage for our evolutionary ancestors and our brain structure reflects that heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say that we are literally “wired” to work better when we feel accountable to another human.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why ultra-successful entrepreneurs –&nbsp;who’ve surrounded themselves with empowering webs of supporting advisors, investors, staff and <em>accountability coaches –&nbsp;</em>do not experience the overwhelm, procrastination and self sabotage caused by isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs with professional, reliable accountability in their lives are able to hit home run after home run without having to exert enormous amounts of time and mental energy. With accountability, they don’t have to endlessly push themselves to execute—instead they easily show up as the best version of themselves. Day after day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain circuitry that drives optimal focus and performance is naturally activated and sustained by accountability, not willpower.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>At Commit Action, we offer a dedicated <a href="https://www.commitaction.com">accountability coaching service</a> AND we also encourage all our clients to stack as many layers of accountability as possible. </strong></p>



<p>Right now in the COVID-19 situation, some business owners are staying mentally clear and rocketing ahead by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Setting up virtual “co-working” Zoom calls&nbsp;</li><li>Scheduling weekly goal setting/accountability check ins with peers&nbsp;</li><li>Instituting family accountability practices by setting goals with spouses and kids&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The truth is, the environment we’re working in right now is so weird and new that we should be stacking as many forms of human connection as possible. <strong>Think of accountability as productivity insurance. And sanity insurance.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>You can’t have too much.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The done-for-you option is to hire a coach. At Commit Action, our <a href="https://www.commitaction.com">one-on-one accountability coaching service </a>will: </p>



<ol><li>Walk you through a weekly cornerstone ritual that dials in an optimized 7 day game plan.&nbsp;</li><li>Schedule deep-work commitments to yourself via an actual sync-able calendar.&nbsp;</li><li>Hold you accountable via phone, email and SMS check ins with a dedicated, highly trained coach.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>We’re sharing our best-practices in the spirit of helping anyone who needs this stuff right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re not ready for coaching but want more, we have an entire video training library with all our best productivity research available free. Just scroll down and click the “Send Me Everything” button.&nbsp;<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the start of every year, I get a handy reminder from my most successful clients that what we do in the first  days of the year matters… extraordinarily so. </p>



<p>Without fail, <strong>the most successful entrepreneurs I speak to <em>all</em> perform a precise, mindful and intentional planning ritual </strong>sometime around the holidays. </p>



<p>Astronomically successful entrepreneurs treat the New Year as a sacred ritual. </p>



<p>This isn’t just a matter of setting a few goals, or journalling. They get a serious head start by taking advantage of the the start of the year to reflect and plan ahead with a precise formula.</p>



<p>These people all have their own personal twist on the process BUT – just like how the fundamentals of a stellar business plan never change – <strong>the same fundamental puzzle pieces of good annual planning are all present at the meta level. </strong></p>



<p>One of my clients gets weird in the woods – they go out to a cabin to be totally alone. </p>



<p>Another spends a ton of time with close family, sharing aspirations and goals.  </p>



<p>One journals. </p>



<p>Another builds spreadsheets.</p>



<p>All of them are committed to their ritual. And underneath that ritual are the <strong>three crucial meta-principles that you can use to get a serious advantage on the next 365 days.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/CA_xmastree.png" alt="Elite entrepreneurs use the holidays to get a massive boost" class="wp-image-6444"/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Principle 1: Intelligent Reflection</strong></h2>



<p>So many people assume that the new year should only be about looking optimistically ahead. </p>



<p>This is a mistake. </p>



<p>Believe this and you miss the biggest opportunity of all:</p>



<p>Without fail, the top 1% of entrepreneurs carefully consider the year that’s been. </p>



<p>By following a precise formula for mindful retrospection, these entrepreneurs immunize themselves from <strong>a dark tendency in the heart of all business owners…</strong></p>



<p>We’re ruthless with ourselves. </p>



<p>I am. You are.</p>



<p>Your expectations for yourself are higher than anyone else could imagine. </p>



<p>Even when you do amazing well, you’re hungry for more. You have the capacity to be extraordinarily hard on yourself. <strong>An entrepreneur&#8217;s internal dialogue on a bad day… would send shivers down the average 9-to-5er’s spine. </strong></p>



<p>This is why an annual pause for intelligent reflection is so crucial. </p>



<p>If you flub it, you’ll enable a ghastly tendency to discount your own achievements and successes – minimizing or forgetting them – that’ll simply vaporize your self esteem.</p>



<p><strong>You’ll be consumed by thoughts that you’ve not accomplished enough, haven’t moved fast enough or grown enough. </strong></p>



<p>The net outcome? A pervading sense of hopelessness. Starting to feel like this whole business thing is a mistake. Feeling lost.</p>



<p>It’s not just reflecting on the good stuff, either. You also need Intelligent Reflection to look critically at mistakes you’ve made.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs DO tend to minimize their past wins, but half the reason you need to positively remember the good stuff is to find the strength to recollect – examine and learn from – the bad.</p>



<p><strong>You need to reflect on the wins and do a post-mortem on the mistakes you’ve made. </strong>The cost of missing that last part is tremendous: You’ll keep making the same mistakes without learning.</p>



<p>Ever feel like you’re hitting your head against a brick wall? </p>



<p>Or maybe just sitting with the same sensation of “stuck-ness” – like a brittle tension in your chest – for months on end?</p>



<p><strong>Entrepreneurs who are stuck beating themselves up, and are ALSO failing to learn from the past… have just one problem: </strong>Intelligent reflection didn’t happen.</p>



<h2><strong>Principle 2: Artful Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>There is no bigger divider between the wannabes and the winners than this one.</p>



<p>Amateurs set goals for the year ahead. </p>



<p>The pros (meanwhile) are <em>artfully designing</em> implementation plans for their vision.</p>



<p>These entrepreneurs rocket themselves into the stratosphere by not <em>just</em> setting long term plans&#8230; and not <em>just</em> knowing where they are now in relation to the plan… but <strong>by using a strategy to map out all the steps from A to B.</strong></p>



<p>The side-effects of NOT doing this are painfully obvious. Here are the top four: </p>



<ol><li>You’re someone who gets that gut-clenching feeling every time when – throughout the year – the 1st of a new month rolls around. </li><li>Dread trickles into your stomach when people around you say things like “Can you believe it’s ALREADY March?!”</li><li>You have huge plans for yourself – big long term goals – but end up sitting down at your desk and defaulting to mindless tasks like clearing out your inbox. </li><li>You feel like whole weeks go by where you do everything (anything!) EXCEPT take steps toward your most important goal. </li></ol>



<p>… If you nodded yes to ANY of these, know this: </p>



<p>The way you set and plan the implementation of your biggest goals… is fundamentally broken and needs to be fixed.</p>



<p><strong>YOU are not broken. </strong></p>



<p>You are fine.</p>



<p><strong>You’re just missing a crucial, psychological planning ingredient that super successful entrepreneurs have in abundance. </strong></p>



<p>Your annual goals need to be fleshed out into an actual implementation plan. Think: Less vision board, more <em>how-to </em>guide. </p>



<h2><strong>Principle 3: Ecology </strong></h2>



<p>Ecology is the relationship of one thing to another. </p>



<p>It’s harmony and alignment. </p>



<p>“Ecology” is at the heart of the most hardcore behavioral psychology.</p>



<p>Ecology is something that’s difficult to put your finger on, but <strong>your goals need it like a fish needs water.</strong></p>



<p>Broken (or missing) ecology means finding out the ladder you’ve worked so hard to climb all year has been leaning up against the wrong tree the whole time. </p>



<p><strong>It means finding out that “success” is not what you thought it would be, but being utterly spent and exhausted from getting there all the same.</strong></p>



<p>A lack of Ecology in your goal setting will actually result in failure so severe you could never even imagine it.</p>



<p>I’ve seen people plummet into absolute hopelessness after chasing something so hard – and getting it, in a way – only to find out there’s no money, or no freedom… or no win to be had at all.</p>



<p>It’s a lack of ecology in this way that causes more entrepreneurs to quit – abandoning GOOD businesses with real potential – than anything else I’ve seen!</p>



<p>When your business looks so disgustingly <strong>trapped</strong>&#8230; that your friends and family are quietly thinking “well if that’s success, I’d rather work in a nine-to-five!” … you’ve flubbed your ecology planning.</p>



<p>When your business hasn’t given you MORE freedom, but has actually taken it <em>away</em>… </p>



<p>… Or you’re working three times harder than most white-collar employees for the same (or less) money… you’ve flubbed your ecology.</p>



<p><strong>What is the ultimate cost of this? </strong></p>



<p>Your unconscious mind will figure it out that you’re not mentally aligned with your own goals. </p>



<p>It’ll learn that moving closer to your goals is making you miserable so – in it’s ultimate mission to protect your emotional health – it’ll slam on the brakes.</p>



<p>The motivation faucet will run dry. </p>



<p>You’ll feel apathetic toward your business. </p>



<p>Disinterested. </p>



<p>Switched off. </p>



<p>Like your house is on fire but you’re just kinda bored of the whole thing.</p>



<h2><strong>The Revolution of Results the 3 principles creates</strong></h2>



<h3>Intelligent Reflection </h3>



<p>… will empower youto spot massive opportunities that are EASY to take advantage of.<strong> You’ll realize that you already cracked the code of success a few times already and simply need to do what works.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll gain a new-found sense of confidence in yourself and your ability to know what to do!</p>



<p>You’ll discover your strengths, avoid your weaknesses and find that SUCCESS ITSELF becomes easier and easier instead of harder. </p>



<p>Doesn’t it make sense that it should be that way?</p>



<p>It makes sense that <strong>the longer you’re in the game, the easier succeeding becomes.</strong> Lack of Intelligent Reflection is the only thing that prevents this being true.</p>



<h3>Artful Implementation Planning</h3>



<p>… will mean you never agonize over what to do next, but simply leap into action. </p>



<p><strong>You’ll become the kind of person who can tell someone – </strong><em><strong>anyone who’s asking</strong></em><strong> – precisely what you’re working on TODAY in your life and business.</strong></p>



<p>The people close to you in your life will be in awe of how you seem to be able to throw an idea, dream or vision out there… and then a few weeks or months later… have something built.</p>



<p>Welcome to the ultra-achievers-club! This is where entrepreneurs look like wizards to the mere mortals around them.</p>



<h3><strong>Ecological Goals </strong></h3>



<p>… will create <strong>a deep, almost spiritual sync</strong> between your conscious mind’s desires and your  unconscious values and drivers.</p>



<p>Your motivational faucet will be turned to full flow… and not in a way where you’re pushing yourself, either. Your motivational drive will be natural and inexorable, like a river rushing over a waterfall. </p>



<p>Unstoppable.</p>



<p>When ecology is in place, your unconscious mind KNOWS that what you’re pursuing is going to be GOOD FOR YOU. There’s no more internal struggle, just a clear sense of wanting what matters… <strong>and the fiery desire to do what it takes to get there</strong>!</p>

<p>The world’s most successful entrepreneurs are transforming their ideas into huge results easier, faster and more often than everyone else. They do so by leveraging a tremendous psychological advantage: <strong>Accountability</strong>.</p>



<p>Accountability itself is the single most scientifically validated tool for improving human behavior. The empirical evidence for this is vast and includes not only studies by psychologists, but also research conducted in the field of applied economics and sociology.</p>



<p>The tremendous power of accountability to improve human performance is more important than ever before in history. Why? Because of two extraordinary transformations occurring in the way humans work:&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 21st century we have more <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>opportunity</strong> than ever before. There’s just one problem:&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>It’s harder to stay accountable, focused and productive than ever &nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In the next 20 years, the United States treasury is predicting over half of the white collar workforce will transition to self-employment. And one in three Americans dream of owning their own business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s unique about the present day is that… for the first time in history, one in three people have <em>everything they need to start a business. </em>It has never been easier to “do your own thing”.</p>



<p>This revolution in the way we work is driven by advances in technology that are so rapid, the world is becoming unrecognizable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is now possible for executives to create millions of dollars of value while working from where they feel like it –&nbsp;via messaging apps and video conferencing – hundreds of miles from their company’s HQ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrepreneurship has been utterly transformed too: The barriers to entry have fallen to almost nothing. Anyone can start a business online, from their bedroom. By working on a laptop in their pajamas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs are building multi-million dollar revenue streams, or simply supplementing other income with “side gig” passion businesses… without ever actually meeting a customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology and The Internet has created this opportunity. There’s nothing like it in human history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the opportunity isn’t the only thing that’s changed…&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Humans are also finding it harder and harder to focus, be productive and take action.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The same technology that is empowering us to work and create value –&nbsp;with more freedom than previous generations could imagine – is also <strong>making us more isolated than humans have ever been. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Remote, tech-empowered creatives and entrepreneurs are facing an accountability crisis.&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>People working primarily with digital tools and total location independence, are inadvertently placing themselves into a state of “accountability vacuum”.</p>



<p>This is especially true for people participating in the creative, knowledge-economy as skilled workers or entrepreneurs. This demographic has the most opportunity to create freedom for themselves from conventional nine-to-five work life. As a result, they’re also the most vulnerable to <em>feeling ineffective, unfocused and unmotivated. </em><strong><em>They lack the accountability that focuses their execution powers on their biggest opportunities.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Human brain science proves that accountability is the ultimate performance booster</strong></h2>



<p>Human beings are social, political primates. As a species, we have thrived by developing sophisticated communication and team work strategies. Relationships with other humans were a tremendous advantage for our evolutionary ancestors and our brain structure reflects that heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say that we are literally “wired” to work better when we feel accountable to another human.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why ultra-successful entrepreneurs –&nbsp;who’ve surrounded themselves with empowering webs of supporting advisors, investors, staff and <em>accountability coaches –&nbsp;</em>do not experience the overwhelm, procrastination and self sabotage caused by isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Meanwhile, the entrepreneurs with professional, reliable accountability in their lives are able to hit home run after home run without having to exert enormous amounts of time and mental energy.</strong> With accountability, they don’t have to endlessly push themselves to execute—instead they easily show up as the best version of themselves. Day after day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain circuitry that drives optimal focus and performance is naturally activated and sustained by accountability, not willpower.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The only catch: Finding reliable, professional accountability</strong></h2>



<p>Optimized accountability used to be a secret weapon of elite executives and the world’s top entrepreneurs leading huge organizations. The army of advisors, coaches, investors, boards and even staff that support a visionary to simply <em>show up as the best version of themselves… </em>is something only the top 0.01% have access to.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Peter Shallard</strong>—the founder of Commit Action—was one of those advisors to the entrepreneur elite in his role as “<a href="https://www.petershallard.com">The Shrink for Entrepreneurs</a>”. A psychotherapist by training, Peter went renegade and built a practice dedicated to supporting the performance of the world’s top founders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He started Commit Action because he realized that the most effective core of elite coaching and advisory was the accountability that came from working with the humans delivering it. The idea was <strong>“Personal Training for Productivity”</strong> — a service that would go on to double its customers effectiveness in their first 30 days of membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His vision for Commit Action’s was simple: <strong>Pure accountability for entrepreneurs, delivered through an evidence-based methodology by ultra-vetted experts—individually trained by Peter himself.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Thousands of entrepreneurs have skyrocketed their performance with accountability coaching</strong></h2>



<p>To date, Commit Action has serviced thousands of entrepreneurs and creatives in over twenty countries. The service revolves around a cornerstone ritual that it “installs” in the client’s business and lives: A once-per-week accountability coach check-in call that acts as an <em>accelerator </em>for all your goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Peter’s bootstrap startup, <strong>Commit Action has also built proprietary technology:</strong> Clients now benefit from a custom built planning tool that allows their dedicated coach to manage their to-dos each week, plan a calendar of “deep work” sprints and send personal one-to-one accountability reminders and check-ins throughout the week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a rapidly growing group of entrepreneurs, Commit Action isn’t just accountability coaching. It’s a mental gym membership with a dedicated “personal trainer”.&nbsp; It’s insurance that guarantees you perform at your best. And it’s an investment that pays for itself over and over, by supercharging your ability to focus and execute on your boldest ideas.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s one single decision you can make that will revolutionize your the day-to-day execution and 10x your odds of winning big in business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the decision to <em>measure the right thing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs have this weird tendency to <em>magically</em> <em>improve whatever it is they’re really tracking, paying attention to, or measuring.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It’s weird because it isn’t even deliberate. You measure stuff, and it gets better. It just <em>happens.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>To understand why this effect is so powerful –&nbsp;and how to use it to get more performance out of yourself –&nbsp;you have to wrap your head around this thing psychologists call “<em>Proximal Goal Setting”.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Here’s the deal: When the goal you’re working toward is a <em>years</em> long project that requires requires luck, timing and connections <em>on top</em> of the requisite “hard work” and entrepreneurial hustle… you still need to <em>feel</em> like you’re making day-to-day progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without a sense of day-to-day forward motion… you’ll lose the momentum and sense of “getting there” that keeps you motivated and focused!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Enter “proximal goals”:&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Proximal goals work via the <strong>gamification</strong> of your small, incremental action steps that move you toward your big, long term and far-away vision. They dramatically improve your <em>focus and effectiveness </em>because when entrepreneurs <em>feel </em>that day-to-day momentum, the feeling feeds their get-shit-done engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Simply put, When you feel like you’re winning, it’s effortless to stay motivated.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>(This gamification of the day-to-day is a central thesis of what we do here at <a href="https://www.commitaction.com">Commit Action</a>, but there is a deeper significance all entrepreneurs should consider in how they track their day to day activity. For more info on the brain science we use, <a href="https://www.commitaction.com/blog">check out our free course</a> that breaks down precisely why a tiny fraction of superhuman entrepreneurs succeed so much easier, faster and more often.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gamification is the magic of</strong> <strong>Measurement&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Gamification is about <em>creating a genuine experience</em> of “winning or losing” in a scenario that’d otherwise be lacking it. <em>Measurement</em> itself is what creates that experience.</p>



<p><strong>Measurement is a feedback loop that tells you that if you’re doing the right thing, or the wrong thing. And it serves as a powerful motivator.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Consider something like the Apple Watch: It takes your ambiguous long term fitness goal (lose weight, get in better shape etc) and serves up a micro, measured <em>proximal goal for each day… </em><strong>to close your rings.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Closing your rings feels good because it’s quantified. It’s bounded. It’s doable in the short term of today. There’s a clear, immediate piece of information telling you if you’re “winning” or if you’re “losing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Human brains LOVE any challenge that is instantly clear that you’re winning or losing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(This is why video games are so fun: Instant feedback. Your competency is continually and instantly measured and reflected back to you by the scoring system of the game.)</p>



<h2><strong>Here’s why humans <em>crave</em> this measurement and gamification:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>For any major goal <em>including things like weight loss and </em><strong><em>especially </em></strong><em>entrepreneurial success</em>—in the day-to-day moments—it’s actually <strong>impossible to tell if you are moving in the right direction.</strong></p>



<p>It’s impossible to know if you’re winning.Right here and now, you simply cannot tell if what you worked on this afternoon <em>made a difference</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have to rely on a proxy for success, instead. That’s what the Apple Watch “closing your rings” represents: It’s a short term proxy for the long term healthy goal you are <em>ultimately</em> aiming for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Human psychology is set up for us to thrive with measurement. We love clocking our competency. We love discrete, winnable challenges. That’s why we get a kick out of “closing our rings”.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Measurement works because it feels <em>amazing</em> to have a day where you experience both starting <em>and finishing </em>something.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When the thing you’re paying attention to <em>in the present moment </em>seems to be moving and improving, that experience—and the dopamine and serotonin it creates—kicks off a virtuous cycle where you get <em>more and more excited to take action.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>This is why what you choose to measure—as an entrepreneur—will determine what truly improves in your business.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2><strong>So what is it that you are <em>paying attention to</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>There are several mental levels that question can be answered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously as an entrepreneur, you want “success”. Wealth, Freedom and perhaps Impact. Or fame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Let’s face it: Status and recognition is a <em>powerful </em>motivator for many people.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is that day-to-day, it’s impossible to know if the thing you’re working on right now—like <em>this afternoon</em>—is genuinely moving you towards those goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a quick look at your to-do list today and see if I’m right:</p>



<p><strong>What is it that you can accomplish </strong><em><strong>today </strong></em><strong>that will give you direct feedback of the experience of Wealth, Freedom or any of that stuff?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>This is why you have to measure something else as a <em>proxy</em> of those things you really want.</strong> As an entrepreneur you must develop a thesis that looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Doing X is going to move me toward the success I really want. If I track it and improve it, I am likely to get what it is that I’m ultimately seeking.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Hence the question: <em>What is it that you are paying attention to?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>On the literal level, it could be the actual dashboards you pay attention to in your business. What do they say?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sales? Churn? Traffic? Conversion rates?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we scratch a little deeper into entrepreneurial psychology, we can think about what <em>you as a business owner </em>are paying attention to:</p>



<h2><strong>Where is it that you’re most focused on, in your business?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>I’ve worked with entrepreneurs who monitor the health of their business—and really their own mental state—by tracking the company’s checking account balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low balance = anxious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of money = happy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(You can see how troubling this would be in any business that requires capital investment and long term planning!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, startup founders pay a lot of attention to cash runway. (How many months they have left, with the money that’s in the bank.)</p>



<p>Digital Marketers pay a lot of attention to revenue, but not always profits. That’s why a lot of “seven figure launch” gurus are secretly barely making ends meet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of people new to entrepreneurship in the last few years are paying attention to <em>social recognition</em> more than anything to do with their actual business. They’re concerned with likes, re-tweets and <em>attention</em>. It’s easy to measure and it feels good when you make progress. It’s also a substitute for <em>actual</em> success and <em>real</em> impact because it’s a lot easier to obtain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The worst thing you can pay attention to:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the things we like to call out in our clients at Commit Action is <em>paying attention to how many hours you’re spending at your desk</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has to be the <em>worst </em>proxy for entrepreneurial success. Ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Case in point: Bill Gates isn’t worth 800,000 times more than you because he worked 800,000 more hours than you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrepreneurship has always been a game of <em>leverage</em>. And it always will be. Hustle and handwork is important, but if you’re not working <em>smarter</em> then you might as well just be working in a regular nine-to-five job.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Whatever you measure, you’ll get more of:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If the time you’re spending at your desk is the only day-to-day “proxy” you have for how well you’re doing… then you’re going to find yourself (unconsciously) spending more and more time at that desk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does it help? Is that what you want? Are you measuring the right thing here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re obsessed with your company’s checking account balance, you’re going to say no to opportunities to invest in growth that pay long term dividends… And that could be shortsighted <strong>because the proxy you’ve chosen is in conflict with your actual long term goal of bottom-line growth.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Whatever you measure is going to—deeply and powerfully—influence your behavior. Your unconscious preferences, your sense of discomfort with certain decisions, what keeps you up at night… all of that will be driven by what you’re focusing on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the question remains:&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What SHOULD you be paying attention to?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t read my writing because you believe in easy answers and simple bullet-point five step formulas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth about measurement is that it is different for every business model. And I don’t necessarily think there’s a definitive answer. Most entrepreneurs have to measure a lot of different things in order to ultimately win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can tell you some things I suspect matter&nbsp;(deeply) and are worthy of <em>considering paying attention to:&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4><strong>Life-Time-Value</strong> (LTV)</h4>



<p>&#8230; is the total net revenue per customer (after subtracting the cost of delivering your goods or service to the customer). It bakes in a basic top-of-the-P&amp;L profitability calculation. Entrepreneurs who pay attention (and optimize) their customer LTV tend to have very, <em>very </em>sexy businesses that are a lot of fun to run.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Customer-Acquisition-Cost</strong> (CAC)</h4>



<p>&#8230; is another good one. This is what you have to spend –&nbsp;including your time, your staff’s pay for their time, your media expenses etc –&nbsp;to turn a stranger into a customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can get a really healthy ratio in the delta between your CAC and your LTV, you’re going to find that people will be throwing money at your business. You’ll end up in the enviable position where you don’t even need investor money, because you can just borrow it and pay it back effortlessly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s another good one that there isn’t an acronym for:</p>



<h4><strong>Reliability</strong></h4>



<p>&#8230; How <em>consistent</em> is your ability to acquire customers? How regularly are strangers finding out about your business and deciding to give you their money? This is sort of about the the size of your market. It’s also about how often you collide with your prospects.</p>



<p>To throw you a curve ball, here’s a weird one that I focused on measuring for years… and it became the backbone of my whole career: </p>



<h4><strong>Word-Count </strong></h4>



<p>I built my <a href="https://www.petershallard.com">Shrink for Entrepreneurs</a> business as a thought leader. I wrote about the intersection of psychology and business for long enough (and consistently enough) that it started bringing me hordes of clients. For the longest time, I measured my <em>daily output of words of new material. </em>If I wasn’t writing anything, I knew I wasn’t moving in the right long term direction. 500 words a day was a huge win that paid me compounding interest. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are all sorts of things you can be paying attention to. And my point with that last one is, depending on your business, there are some very <em>useful </em>proximal goals that are actually quite far from the obvious metrics like “number of customers paying money”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What’s important is asking the question.&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Realizing that <em>you are going to unconsciously measure SOMETHING</em> is the key here. Because all entrepreneurs need those game-ified short feedback loops to feel <em>good about taking action</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Most entrepreneurs should be playing a dozen different kinds of proximal-goal games with themselves</strong>, across their customer acquisition channels, their customer service “departments”, their product design, networking and more. Not to mention their personal life, their health and relationships to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you only walk away from this article with one insight, let it be this: Find out what you’re <em>already unconsciously measuring </em>on a day-to-day. And think it through. Consider changing it. And if you want help installing a powerful cornerstone ritual of measurement into your life and business (among other productivity supercharging tactics!) <a href="https://www.commitaction.com">check out the Commit Action coaching service!&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>At the end of the day, there’s just one thing you need to know about the psychology of measurement: <strong>Whatever you’re measuring is what you’re going to get more of.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>

<p>If you’re like most business owners, you believe reading good quality non-fiction business books is always a good thing. And you undoubtably have a big stack of books you need to get to.</p>



<p>If that’s you, this article is going to make you question everything. </p>



<p>You’ve probably been reading business books wrong and missing out on the value they offer. </p>



<p>The way it works for most people is simple: Read a business book – be it abstract principles or detailed tactics – and start implementing them. </p>



<p>Entrepreneurs read books to learn. And we learn in order to get better results. Faster. </p>



<p>So you grab a book (or how-to guide) and put it to work. So that you can do better. Get there faster. Skip the mistakes. The idea is to learn <em>easily </em>from the hard-won learnings the author already made. </p>



<p>The only problem is that it never works out:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/CA_cycle_1v2-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6854"/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Everything about this flow chart is completely broken</strong></h2>



<p>Entrepreneurs don’t really learn this way. Entrepreneurship can’t be taught this way. </p>



<p>Entrepreneurship can’t be taught in school. That’s not a controversial idea. </p>



<p>We laugh at the idea of attempting to lay out a guaranteed path to startup (or bootstrap) success in a dusty textbook or classroom. </p>



<p>We know deep down that—even if you can write the principles out—the heart and spirit of entrepreneurship only comes from doing. You know: The School of Hard Knocks. Street smarts are better than book smarts. Blah blah blah…</p>



<p>That’s why here at Commit Action our #1 ultimate principle is: </p>



<h3><strong>Execution is everything </strong></h3>



<p>And I know what you’ll say next… </p>



<p><em>“But I DO execute on the insights I read in books!” </em></p>



<p>But here’s the thing: In the 1970s we humans figured out – via some brilliant research – the truth about how people learn. Turns out there’s two types of knowledge: </p>



<h2><strong>Tacit Knowledge</strong> and <strong>Explicit Knowledge</strong>. </h2>



<p><strong>Explicit Knowledge</strong> is the stuff they teach in school. It’s things you can consciously study for, with your highlighters and your post-it notes. It’s things you can memorize into your mental encyclopedia. </p>



<p><strong>Tacit Knowledge</strong> is the type of knowledge that is next to impossible to communicate to another person verbally, or by writing it down. It’s the “you have to know it your bones” wisdom. It can only be learned by <em>doing. </em>“Earned” might be a better word. </p>



<p><strong>Entrepreneurship is ALL Tacit Knowledge</strong></p>



<p>Tacit Knowledge is built – at the psychological level – through a cyclic action of discovery that looks like this: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/CA_cycle_2-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6855"/></figure></div>



<p>Golf is a metaphor, of course. This diagram is actually the engine of entrepreneurial wisdom attainment. </p>



<p>It’s how you learn the deep truths about business. It’s how you level up your ability to make the right moves for your company. It’s how you win. </p>



<h2><strong>The problem with book learnin’ </strong></h2>



<p>(I’m facetiously using that apostrophe to imply that I’m a book-hating illiterate. Here’s a quote from Aristotle just so you know I’m kidding…) </p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”</em></strong></p>



<p><em>&#8211; Aristotle </em></p>



<p>Books are great. They’re great for entrepreneurs. </p>



<p>The problem is the <em>phase</em> – in the flow of learning/doing diagrammed above – in which entrepreneurs are reading their books. </p>



<p>Like the first diagram in this article suggests, business owners are picking up books as a starting point. They’re <em>beginning</em> with learning, with abstract principles and/or actionable tactics. </p>



<h2><strong>Starting with a book is a mistake </strong></h2>



<p>As an entrepreneur, you can enter the cycle of discovery – aka the wisdom &amp; street smarts learning vortex – at either of these three places: </p>



<ol><li>Active Experimentation</li><li>Concrete Experience </li><li>Abstract Conceptualization </li></ol>



<p>When you <em>begin </em>with <strong>Active Experimentation</strong>, you’re basically playing with ideas in such a curious and playful way you don’t even feel like an entrepreneur. This is how product-focused “civilians” become entrepreneurs: It’s the person tinkering in their garage because they’re damn sure they can cobble together a better electric toothbrush (or whatever) for themselves. </p>



<p>They play (actively experiment) and then hit a great idea – or what they think is one – which graduates them to the next phase of the cycle. </p>



<p>You can also <em>begin </em>with <strong>Concrete Experience</strong> though. This happens to industry execs who spend years gaining deep expertise in their field and then start companies of their own to solve the problems they’ve grown to deeply understand. When they finally decide to make the leap into entrepreneurship, it’s their real (concrete!) experience of knowing <em>what’s up</em> in their space… that often makes the business a big win. </p>



<p>You can start at <strong>Abstract Conceptualization</strong> too. It’s where you sit around intellectually thinking about <em>what’d be cool to create as an entrepreneur</em>. This is pie-in-the-sky, pipe-dream ideation stuff. I think it’s the highest risk (most likely to fail) way to dive into entrepreneurship, but occasionally – like most high risk pursuits – people who start companies this way end up winning big. Like, billion dollar big. </p>



<h2><strong>Reflective Observation isn’t an option</strong></h2>



<p>Only three out of four points on the vortex diagram work as launch pads. You can’t START a business at the Reflective Observation phase. </p>



<p>If you have a business, you can’t genuinely start an <em>idea</em> – for even a product, a project or even a marketing campaign – at Reflective Observation. </p>



<p><strong>Reflective Observation is the phase you should READ in. </strong></p>



<p>The thing entrepreneurs get wrong about reading is the idea that a book should be the genesis of a new idea, or a new shortcut. </p>



<p>The best business books – and arguably all of them – serve as powerful lenses to hyper-focus <em>the quality of your ability to reflect intelligently.</em> </p>



<p>What are you reflecting on? The ideas you had (<strong>Abstract Conceptualization</strong>), the action you took (<strong>Active Experimentation</strong>) and the feedback the market gave you (<strong>Concrete Experience</strong>). </p>



<p>The Reflective Observation phase is super important. It’s where the other three categories mesh and mentally percolate. It’s where the real, genuine “aha moments” occur. It’s where entrepreneurial success progresses not in small steps, but in giant leaps. </p>



<p>The problem with business books and the act of “business reading” is that it tries to <em>start </em>you there. </p>



<p>You know exactly what I’m talking about because you’ve felt it: Reading revolutionary books that stimulate those “aha” epiphany moments… only to find (months later) that nothing really changed in your life or business. </p>



<p>The reason those epiphanies are completely empty is <em>precisely </em>because you’re reading the wrong way. You’re trying to jumpstart the vortex of entrepreneur-wisdom-attainment by starting with the good (fun) part first. </p>



<p><strong>You’re trying to shortcut the system. And it never works. </strong></p>



<h2><strong>Good news: The solution is simple</strong></h2>



<p>Do not read with the intention of learning new stuff to do. That’s not how you’ll win.</p>



<p>Instead, read to <em>get perspective on your past</em> – the action you’ve already taken – in order to realize deep truths that help you decide what to do next. </p>



<p>That’s how you win. It works infinitely better this way. </p>



<p><strong>The world needs more great business ideas to succeed. It needs more smart entrepreneurs. </strong></p>



<p><strong>And that means the world <em>desperately</em> needs more people—who haven’t done anything yet—to put down the books and start <em>doing. </em></strong></p>



<p>The big secret is simply: You have to take action. First. </p>



<p>You have to start with doing. Any one of those three categories will work as a jumping off point. Hitting all three of them is even better.</p>



<p>It’s only then that reading books will revolutionize your success as an entrepreneur. Books are for reflective observation. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of Commit Action has always been to create ultra-optimized accountability<strong> where it is most absent and most needed</strong>: <em>We inject pro accountability into the big audacious projects where entrepreneurs like you have little.</em></p>



<p>These projects tend to be both the biggest opportunities for serious business growth… and simultaneously, they’re the easiest projects to procrastinate. </p>



<p>They’re the “10x” force multipliers. They’re also the scariest things to work on. </p>



<p>I’m talking about tasks that you never <em>have </em>to do – that not even your customers will <em>expect</em> you to do – but that when you finally do… <em>do… </em></p>



<p><em>… </em>Well, <em>doing</em> them rockets you into orbit! </p>



<p>Committing to yourself to actually sit down and move the ball forward on these high-growth projects is <strong>the hardest part of entrepreneurship</strong>.</p>



<p>You have to face your fears. You have to harness your creativity. It’s all on you. And if it were easy, everyone would be doing it. </p>



<p>It helps to break those projects down into specific, measurable steps. It helps to be held accountable and to set yourself up with personal deadlines. </p>



<p>Commit Action’s service does all this for you… which is why it <em>works</em>. </p>



<p><strong>And today we’re announcing how we’re making Commit Action work even better!</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/CA_uncover-1024x512.png" alt="Commit Action new feature" class="wp-image-6828"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Our newest game-changing addition to Commit Action is a calendar tool that allows you to set<em> appointments with yourself to work on your most important goals. </em></strong></p>



<p>We’re now bringing clarity to our members not just around <strong><em>what</em></strong>they should be working on, but also on <strong><em>when</em></strong>they’re working on it! </p>



<p>And when your Commit Action aide asks you “<em>When?</em>”, they’re bringing the whole arsenal of Commit Action&#8217;s core &#8220;pillars&#8221; to the party: Specificity, Measurability, Accountability and of course Deadlines.</p>



<p>Commit Action historically has offered entrepreneurs a way to outsource the day-to-day management of their most important, high leverage to-do list. </p>



<p>Signing up for Commit Action is like putting a “pro” <em>in charge of that</em> – literally running our custom to-do list software – on your behalf. </p>



<p><strong>And now, Commit Action also offers entrepreneurs a way to outsource the building and maintaining of a high leverage execution calendar. </strong></p>



<p>I’m not talking about the calendar of meetings, appointments or responsibilities you already have. Those are the commitments where you’re accountable to your team, your customers, family or friends. You already show up to those appointments. </p>



<p>Instead, I’m talking about the calendar you <em>should </em>be creating: <strong>A</strong> <strong>new calendar of appointments to work on things that matter to you, where you’re accountable to no one but yourself. </strong></p>



<p>Commit Action now builds that calendar for you. </p>



<p>Each and every week. </p>



<h1><strong>The Commit Action Calendar </strong></h1>



<p><strong>Goes live for all customers Monday January 14th</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-01-08-at-11.31.59-AM.png" alt="CA Calendar Feature" class="wp-image-6846"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>We’re launching an integrated – universally subscribe-able – calendar system into our Commit Action app and our methodology.</strong></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what it does:</p>



<ul><li>Scheduled and intentional execution plan (in calendar form!) </li><li>Subscribe and view on any device (smart phone, computer etc) </li><li>Get timely, personal check-in SMS from your aide (never a robot) </li><li>Build out a schedule for all your commitments to yourself </li><li>All concierge managed by your CA Aide  </li></ul>



<p>The ideas behind it this huge new feature are powerful: </p>



<h3><strong>Scheduled and intentional execution plan </strong></h3>



<p>Each week, you set three clarified “Committed Tasks” with your CA aide. </p>



<p>Your aide will now be asking you <em>when </em>you intend to work on those things, as well as holding you accountable to your estimate of how long the work will take. </p>



<p>Then, they’ll create an “appointment” in the calendar. </p>



<p>That calendar event serves as an intention and commitment to <em>execute on your terms – when and where you choose. </em></p>



<h3><strong>Subscribe and view on any device</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/iPhone-X-1.0.jpg" alt="Commit action calendar " class="wp-image-6847"/></figure></div>



<p>You can work from your calendar via our app at any time, <strong>or you can subscribe to your calendar from ANY of your devices. </strong></p>



<h3><strong>Get timely, personal check-in Text messages from your aide</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0512-473x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6848"/></figure></div>



<p>What’s essential about this feature is that it gives your aide an insight into <em>when </em>you’re committed to executing, even when you’re not on the phone with them.</p>



<p><strong>So members can expect personalized, <em>time specific </em>check ins from their aide – no robots, no auto-responders – to help them stay focused and on track.
</strong></p>



<p>Having someone in your corner who is aware of the<strong> execution intentions </strong>within your day to day game plan… changes everything.</p>



<p>Unlike every other productivity software or reminder system where thoughtless &#8220;AI&#8221; sends ham-fisted notifications, you will have your dedicated (highly trained!) human team member reaching out.</p>



<p>This dialogue will evolve and customize exactly as you need it: Need less encouragement? A softer touch? More &#8220;drill sergeant&#8221; style?</p>



<p>Whatever is optimal for you, your business and your psychology. It&#8217;s all possible because <strong>we&#8217;ve transformed the concept of &#8220;Notifications&#8221; into the simple idea that you and your aide can communicate directly.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Build out a schedule for all your commitments to yourself </strong></h2>



<p>Over time, your Commit Action calendar will also expand to include <em>all </em>the commitments you want to make to yourself, not just your three Commit Action tasks for the week. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-01-08-at-11.34.45-AM-575x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6849"/></figure></div>



<p>Not only that, but it will also allow you and your aide to break your Committed Tasks into their relevant components. An entrepreneur might move mountains on one single project in a week, by working for an hour each morning on five different pieces of it. </p>



<p>Now, our calendar will enable you to plan all of that.  </p>



<p>You can use it as a planning layer – on top of any other calendars you use – to see how your appointments and meetings map on top of your <strong>intentions for executing the big stuff. </strong></p>



<p>Just like our to-do list methodology, the idea isn’t to build the <em>perfect </em>calendar you stick to like magic. It’s to create a specific, intentional execution plan… and then to see how close to your intentions your reality actually is. (And to learn something when things go wrong.)</p>



<p><strong>By integrating the calendar into your weekly check in call, the optimization of all four of the Commit Action &#8220;pillars&#8221; is exponentially multiplied.</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Everything is &#8220;concierge managed&#8221; by your Commit Action Aide</strong></h3>



<p>What’s essential about this feature is that <strong>you never have to do anything. </strong></p>



<p><strong>You just have to show up. </strong></p>



<p>The Commit Action aide team is trained to build out and maintain these calendars on behalf of their clients. Week by week, your aide tweak and optimize yours as you hone your ability to predict your own performance, to anticipate obstacles and to move mountains with your execution. </p>



<p><strong>Your aide&#8217;s job is to <em>ride that edge</em> of pushing you to do just a bit more than you think you’re capable of.</strong> The calendar will always be <em>ambitious</em>. And it will always help you build your focus and execution muscles. </p>



<p>You don’t have to do <em>anything to organize this, </em>your high leverage calendar will be built for you. <strong>You just have to show up and execute. </strong></p>



<p>Execution is everything. </p>



<p><strong>We believe that the future of entrepreneurship – and work itself – is human connection. </strong></p>



<p>By creating tools that bring you closer to a dedicated human helper, and the accountability and multiplying effects of connected brains (versus an isolated one!) … we believe we can rapidly accelerate the rate at which you make your biggest entrepreneurial dreams a reality.  </p>



<p>The calendar feature Commit Action&#8217;s biggest evolution of that philosophy. We’re excited for you to start using it, and to learn and grow together. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not already a Commit Action member, <a href="https://app.commitaction.com/login">you can sign up here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My friend Jon and I were grabbing lunch, talking about a strange paradox we both experienced. The second we went “all in” by leaping full time into our first business, leaving behind the safety net of a job… something unexpected and deeply unsettling happened. </p>



<p>It’s a paradox almost every entrepreneur has experienced: </p>



<p><strong>The day you set yourself <em>truly free </em>as an entrepreneur– free to manage your own time, free to work 100% on your own thing, <em>free to truly focus –  </em>is the same day that <em>actually focusing </em>becomes exponentially more difficult<em>. </em></strong></p>



<p>The story always goes something like this:</p>



<p>Smart, passionate entrepreneur-in-waiting dreams of being free. </p>



<p>What makes them an entrepreneur? They have a healthy sense of rejection for authority. And a general impatience with the status quo. </p>



<p>They’re impatience because they’re IN it. They’re working the job – being part of the system – along side other drones who are content with being told what to do.</p>



<p>This itches the entrepreneur. In fact, it eats at them. They know they’re destined to go do their own thing. They’re determined. </p>



<p>Then, this person <strong>finds</strong> <strong>their idea</strong>. </p>



<p>They start working on their idea as a “side-hustle.” </p>



<p>After hours. Weekends. Early mornings. Lunch breaks. </p>



<p>Whenever they can – whenever a moment presents itself – the entrepreneur is maniacally focused, <em>pushing their business concept forward</em>. </p>



<h2>You’ll never be as productive as an entrepreneur with a side-hustle</h2>



<p>Entrepreneurs who have to moonlight because they’re working a job, or are balancing dozens of other responsibilities… are <em>always </em>more focused and effective. </p>



<p>They’ll work like a madman to prove out the idea, validate their model and ultimately get to the point where they’re ready to leap. </p>



<h2>The “all in” leap feels amazing, once you’re finally ready </h2>



<p>The entrepreneur walks out of their old job office that final time. And it feels so, so good. </p>



<p>You can see it playing out like a movie: Tell the boss you’re done. That you’re off to captain your own damn ship. </p>



<p><strong>This moment feels great because you can feel your future – and the literal time and energy you need to rocket your business idea forward – open up in front of you. </strong></p>



<p>Like a wide open field of <em>raw potential</em>, you now have everything you need to fully clear your head and focus on nothing but executing your vision. </p>



<p><em>“Imagine how much I can get done now that I’m not just limited to weekends and evenings” </em>you think to yourself. </p>



<h2>But <em>something changes </em>the moment you walk out that door into full time entrepreneurship</h2>



<p>My friend Jon – who quit his top tier Manhattan law firm job to start his own meditation training company – describes<strong> feeling like he took days to do what he used to accomplish in mere hours. </strong></p>



<p>I remember the early days of my full time efforts with my first company, too: </p>



<p>Suddenly it was just me, my laptop, an empty schedule and an almost infinite “blue ocean” of possibility in front of me. </p>



<p>With all that space, I felt like I had so much time that <strong>it became too easy to take it easy.</strong> </p>



<p>It was too easy to get distracted reading news and scrolling social media. Watching Netflix. Pretty much anything other than working on <em>the </em><strong><em>high leverage</em></strong><em> stuff that would rocket my biz forward. </em></p>



<p><strong>The whole reason I wanted to be self employed was so I could live a better life.</strong></p>



<p>And on my first day as a full time entrepreneur? </p>



<p>I could live better – right <em>now – </em>by just choosing <em>not to work</em>. </p>



<p>I could enjoy myself <em>now – </em>not just in the future<em> –</em> by screwing around. I’d just worry about building the business… later. </p>



<p><strong>And even when I did choose to work on something, I’d pick the easy low-leverage work: </strong>Answer emails or do “research”. Or elaborate “planning&#8221;. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/entrepreneur-with-huge-list.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6411"/></figure></div>



<p>I’d do that stuff, instead of executing the <em>high leverage </em>ideas I had, which required courage: </p>



<p><em>The scary phone calls to prospective clients. </em></p>



<p><em>Publishing marketing campaigns, so people could actually see them. </em></p>



<p>… Anything that might skyrocket me forward, but also felt risky. Anything that scared my lizard brain. </p>



<p>I’d keep tell myself I had so much time – so much wide open space on my newly freedom-filled calendar – that I could get to that stuff later. </p>



<p>I’d get to it when I felt like it. </p>



<p>When I was better prepared. </p>



<p>When the passion was there. </p>



<p><strong>After months of spinning my wheels like this, I started wondering what the hell was wrong with me. </strong></p>



<h2>Freedom doesn’t create entrepreneurial success, structure does. </h2>



<p><em>“Constraints inspire Creativity” </em>– Jack Dorsey, Founder of Twitter </p>



<p>Turns out that the reason side-hustling entrepreneurs get so much done in the limited time they have… is precisely <em>because</em> their time is limited. </p>



<p>As a newly minted entrepreneur with a ton of experience in psychology, I started researching: </p>



<p>I needed to figure out why I was so unfocused. <strong>I wanted to know why it would take me days to accomplish something <em>I knew I had the potential to do in a few hours. </em></strong></p>



<p>What I found was horrifying. </p>



<p>It turns out that the “freedom” entrepreneurs are so magnetically drawn towards… was precisely what was holding them back. </p>



<p>I found – by looking at super effective entrepreneurs who hadhit massive home runs – that they <em>paradoxically chose to set aside their freedom from time to time. </em></p>



<p>On purpose. </p>



<p>They gave freedom up. </p>



<p><strong>By choosing to temporarily remove their own freedom, these entrepreneurs transformed themselves into <em>execution powerhouses</em>. </strong></p>



<h2>How did they give up freedom? </h2>



<p>They didn’t give it up entirely. </p>



<p>In fact, what I observed was more of a have-you-cake-and-eat-it-too situation than you’d expect. </p>



<p>What I witnessed was entrepreneurs creating structure around themselves with <strong>accountability. </strong></p>



<p>Instead of operating as a lone wolf, these super-achievers would set up <em>structure</em> with trusted allies: They’d check in, clarify goals, set expectations and be <em>held accountable to their own extraordinary, ambitious vision. </em></p>



<h2><strong>The psychological side effects of isolation cause the entrepreneur paradox </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/CA_overwhelmbig_1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6379"/></figure></div>



<p>Freedom itself erodes your focus and effectiveness, because you’re too alone. </p>



<p><strong>Isolation is the focus killer. </strong></p>



<p>It slows down execution. </p>



<p>It invites distraction. </p>



<p>It makes it easy for self-sabotaging habits to creep into your work day, unchecked. </p>



<p>Entrepreneurs who are excited to captain their own ship <em>forget how crippling the isolation at sea can be. </em>Even if you’ve got sailors (staff) working for you, you often feel lonely at the top. </p>



<p>Once I discovered the truth about freedom and isolation, I found countless studies – and spoke to hundreds of mega successful entrepreneurs – that all confirmed the same thing: </p>



<p><strong>Entrepreneurial isolation was causing several crucial “mental foundations” for focus and effectiveness… to be dangerously absent. </strong></p>



<p>Accountability was a big one, but there are several more. </p>



<p>Entrepreneurs whose mental isolation deprives them of these things often feel like they’re <em>going crazy</em>. </p>



<p>They blame themselves for not doing more, or moving faster. They feel like they’re not living up to the potential <em>they know lies within them. </em></p>



<p>If you’ve felt this way, know this: </p>



<h2>It’s not your fault. </h2>



<p>And, you can still fill those mental foundation gaps. </p>



<p>All you need to do is set aside your freedom – just slightly, and only temporarily – so you can finally take action and <em>build your thing</em>… the thing that truly sets you free. </p>

<p>Ever wonder if you’re working on the <em>right</em> stuff? </p>



<p>Do you wonder if what you’re doing will actually <em>work out</em> and create the big profits and growth you’re hoping for?</p>



<p>A weird thing happens when humans work on big, long term projects. <strong>Our brain plays tricks on us when we ask ourselves if we’re doing the right things. </strong></p>



<p>Entrepreneurs – especially – get caught up in this weirdness every single day. And it’s the single biggest cause of self sabotage: Of entrepreneurs screwing up ideas and giving up on them prematurely. </p>



<p>If you want to make sure you actually execute – <em>all the way to finish</em> – on the best ideas you have, you need to decrypt this part of your psychology. Here’s what you’ve got to understand: </p>



<h2>Humans are really good at taking action when feedback is immediate. </h2>



<p>It can be positive or negative, so long there’s some sort of visceral, experience-able result. </p>



<p>This is why video games are so compelling: Candy Crush (or Dark Souls) is stimulating because you <em>immediately</em> know when you’re winning or when you’re losing. </p>



<p>The same thing occurs when you eat a donut: Your brain instantly benefits from a caloric hit of fat and sugar. </p>



<p>Eat a donut and millions of years of evolutionary conditioning kick in. All designed to make you prioritize energy dense food sources. Your blood sugar spikes. You get a hit of serotonin and dopamine. You feel good. You’re getting “feedback” that what you did – the thing you just ate – is <em>a very good thing. </em></p>



<p><strong>These feedback loops are the secret to motivation </strong></p>



<p>It’s effortless to take action when you have clear, present-moment indicators telling you that you’re <em>winning at the game of life. </em></p>



<p>When you do something – like eating that donut – and you immediately <em>feel good</em> (via your taste buds, blood sugar etc) it is the easiest thing to take more and more of that “action”. It’s the most natural motivation in the world.</p>



<p><strong>But what about when that immediate feedback is not present? </strong></p>



<h2>Measuring your efficacy as an entrepreneur </h2>



<p>The game of business building is an exercise in delayed gratification. It takes a long time for the actions you take <em>today – </em>as a business owner – to pan out and create the big results you’re ultimately hoping for. </p>



<ul><li>Designing and developing a new product. </li><li>Building out a new marketing funnel. </li><li>Implementing systems and processes to increase efficiency or margins. </li></ul>



<p>These are all examples of games entrepreneurs play to get what they want. They all contain inherent risk: You might win. And you might lose. </p>



<p>Most importantly, these three examples all tend to have enormously long “feedback loops”. <strong>That simple means that it can take months to learn if <em>the actions you carried out were indeed the correct, “winning” ones. </em></strong></p>



<p>Every entrepreneur ends up deep in the trenches of their business, working on this stuff, wondering if they’re doing the right things or if they’re even winning at all. </p>



<p>In every meaningful opportunity or long term project you work on, you enter a sort of <em>valley of ambiguity </em>(and often despair!) where you’re in the thick of execution and you have <strong>no idea</strong> if it’ll all work out. You can’t see your way out of the valley – you don’t know what’s on the other side – but you have to keep on trudging to get out anyway. </p>



<p>When you’re an entrepreneur working on some new marketing idea… there isn’t something feeding you mini hits of serotonin like when you eat donuts or play Candy Crush. <strong>Instead, you have to execute despite the fact that nothing <em>in the moment </em>will tell you if you’re doing it right. </strong></p>



<h2>The Gamification of Entrepreneurship </h2>



<p>The solution to getting lost in this valley of <em>execution ambiguity</em> is to make a game out of your projects. </p>



<p>The idea here is to leverage a well researched principle of psychology called <strong>Proximal Goal Setting</strong>. A proximal goal is simply a bite-sized implementation step of a larger, bigger picture goal you’ve set for yourself. </p>



<p>They work so powerfully for entrepreneurs because instead of sitting down at your desk each day to “make a million bucks”, you get to set micro-objectives that are <em>actually doable</em> in a day. </p>



<p><strong>Proximal goals are the video games of personal growth.</strong> They break big, long term, complex and ambiguous goals into short term winnable challenges. </p>



<p>What’s essential about proximal goals is the proactive decision you make when you set them: </p>



<p><em>You’re deciding to quit asking deep questions about your big far-away goals, and to focus instead on the game you’ve created for yourself in the present moment. </em></p>



<p>Here’s how it works: </p>



<p>As a blogger and writer, my big and ambiguous goal is to drive traffic to my website, increase trust, convert sales and cement my position as a thought leader. (This is technically called a “Distal Goal”). </p>



<p><strong>My proximal goal – when I sit down at my desk on any weekday morning – is to draft five hundred words of brand new material. </strong></p>



<p>The proximal goal is game-ified with meta-measurement: I keep a tracker that I check off for accomplishing that daily, micro-action of writing. I build streaks. I’m vastly more likely to write on a Friday if I also wrote every day Monday through Thursday. </p>



<p><strong>Most important of all, checking off my “Draft five hundred words” proximal goal <em>feels </em>good. </strong></p>



<p>Psychologists have shown that accomplishing proximal goals – even when they’re just a drop in the bucket of our bigger distal goal – does the same thing as the donut and the video games: <strong>It activates the brain’s reward centers. </strong></p>



<p>By making yourself feel good at a chemical level, it becomes easier and easier to train your brain to build a terrific habit of executing on your proximal goal steps.</p>



<p>So, instead of beating myself up about the enormity of my huge ultimate objective as a blogger, which some days I really don’t progress on in any measurable way… I simply narrow my focus to the ritual of writing five hundred words. </p>



<h2>Entrepreneurs are chronically bad at proximal goal setting</h2>



<p>As business owners, we love to dream big and execute on bold plans. We get excited about big projects because distal, long term goals ARE super motivating. For a second. <strong>Distal goals fire us up by activating our imagination of future reward. </strong></p>



<p>We <em>deeply desire </em>those big long term transformational objectives like becoming rich, famous and totally free. That’s why it’s easy to come up with some distal goal and jump straight into working on it. </p>



<p>The problem is, <strong>all that motivation tends to run out</strong> after a day or so. </p>



<p>For many entrepreneurs, the initial thrill of an exciting distal goal is enough to get a whiteboard planning session done… and very little else. </p>



<p>This is because the entrepreneurial psychology that makes you so good at seeing big opportunities, crafting compelling visions – being an “ideas person” in other words – is pretty much the opposite of the mindset needed to execute on an idea. </p>



<p><strong>After the initial big picture planning session, most entrepreneurs really need a hard worker – who doesn’t ask too many questions – to take over. </strong></p>



<p>This article and the idea of gamification and proximal goals… is telling you how to become that person. </p>



<p><strong>It’s your job to become the kind of person you’d hire to take action your best ideas, if you could.  </strong></p>



<p>If an entrepreneur sets a big vision and constantly keeps revisiting that far-away goal – re-thinking and tweaking it – they’re never going to get anything done.</p>



<p>No matter how high level and strategic you think you are, you’ve got to get down to work and make the thing happen. You have to stop white-boarding your ideas, and start doing the heavy lifting. </p>



<p>Setting proximal goals that game-ify your big vision <em>works,</em> because just by setting those micro-steps you are <strong>presupposing that the big distal goal is fixed. </strong>By definition, when you’re working on your proximal goal you cannot be questioning and over-analyzing the big picture. </p>



<p><strong>It’s kinda like your “CEO self” has set a specific project and given it to your “Worker self”. </strong></p>



<p>When I’m drafting my five hundred words of new content, I’m not <em>simultaneously asking myself if writing is really the thing that’s going to get me to where I want to go. </em></p>



<p>I’m not researching other mediums for thought leadership. I’m not thinking:</p>



<p><em>“Should I maybe be trying to get more speaking gigs instead of writing this article?”</em></p>



<p>I’m not gazing into any of those existential voids. </p>



<p>I’m not thinking about anything <strong>except what to write</strong>. And that’s the only reason I ever get anything written. </p>



<h2>The problem is that most entrepreneurs want to spend all their time in “CEO” mode.</h2>



<p>It’s understandable. That’s the fun place to be. You get to sit around and <em>have ideas</em>. </p>



<p>But that, and five bucks, will buy you a sandwich. </p>



<p>There’s no value in ideas without action. Execution is everything. </p>



<p>Setting up clear games for yourself, where you’re measuring your personal effectiveness on <em>individual tasks that will add up to something greater… </em>is treating yourself exactly like the employee you need. </p>



<p><strong>You would <em>never </em>hire someone and start them on a project, then stop them a day later because you’ve had a different idea.</strong> You’d have them consistently execute and then a month later, you’d sit down and evaluate the <em>efficacy of what they did. </em></p>



<p>This is a segmentation of the psyche that acknowledges that there is a time and a place for strategic “big picture” CEO thinking… but that day to day, you also need to measure and reward your actual output <em>without connecting it to the big picture. </em></p>



<p>It’s that <em>output</em> and the concrete results your worker-self creates… that your CEO-self will be actually strategically analyzing <em>anyway. </em></p>



<p>And I’m not saying strategic thinking is bad. There’s a time and a place for it. If I wrote articles for years and never actually checked to see what kind of results they were creating, I’d be an idiot. </p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge, however, that <strong><em>all </em>your business elephants are eaten one bite at a time.</strong> Putting in consistent effort on <em>things you think will probably add up</em>… tends to add up. </p>



<p>Patient, relentless execution… Works. </p>



<p>People who never measure their output get stuck in a kind of analysis paralysis where they’re thinking like a big bad CEO, but there’s no <em>actual business</em> for them to strategize or analyze. </p>



<p>Nothing is going on. They’re frozen, <strong>faking it but never making it.</strong> They’re constantly switching strategies, re-inventing their “business” and shifting the bar on their big goals. </p>



<p>They’re all ideas and excitement, but zero results… because they can’t execute. </p>



<p><strong>Mental games of self-measurement – on the other hand – are a structure that will set you free</strong>. </p>



<p>They’ll take you out of your head, and get you actually moving. And actually <em>producing</em>. When you do flip back into strategic thinking mode, you’ll learn more from your hard won, <em>real-world experience</em> than you ever could’ve imagined. </p>

<p>There’s a popular saying amongst entrepreneurs: </p>



<p><em> “Focus on your strengths and outsource your weaknesses”</em></p>



<p>And it’s mostly true.</p>



<p>A handful of business owners have a tremendous advantage: They know exactly when <strong>not </strong>to follow thisprinciple<em>. </em>And they rocket ahead of everyone else <em>because</em> they’re <em>seeing the forest </em>despite the trees. They win bigger and quicker… because they’re doing things differently. </p>



<p>This article will show you how to pinpoint precisely which of your strengths you should focus on developing… and which weaknesses you maybe shouldn’t outsource just yet. </p>



<h3>Why you should pause for thought before outsourcing all your weaknesses</h3>



<p>Think of a startup founder who knows <em>zero </em>about writing code. </p>



<p>They need some code written, so they decide to put out a job ad for a developer. </p>



<p><em><strong>So what do they write in the ad? </strong></em></p>



<p>Do they know what programing language they need to hire a specialist in? Are they looking for front-end dev support? Or a back-end systems architect to build a seamless machine? </p>



<p>They don’t know. And if a smart developer reads the job ad this entrepreneur writes… the developer immediately knows that <em>this person has no freaking idea what they’re doing</em>. </p>



<p>Experienced, smart, passionate devs want to do well paid work on interesting projects. <strong>They’ll ignore this entrepreneurs job ad like the giant red flag that it is</strong>. Instead, opportunistic hacks will be attracted because the entrepreneur looks like an easy mark.</p>



<p>Cheaters and con artists – people leveraging geo-arbitrage to outsource the actual work to engineers in third world countries so they can clip their ticket along the way – they’ll respond to this ad and promise the entrepreneur the world. They’ll take their money and deliver crap. </p>



<p>And here’s the real issue: </p>



<p><strong>Even if an amazingly skilled, high integrity developer applied… how would you know they were any good if you know nothing about code yourself?</strong> How would you compare their application to the dozens of totally trash applicants you’re looking at? </p>



<p>If you’ve read this far, my guess is that you’re grateful you’re not hiring a software engineer any time soon! </p>



<h3>ThE outsourcing of weakness trap</h3>



<p>It happens to small business owners who hire marketing agencies. It happens to anyone hiring a designer to put together a new website they have enormous hopes for. </p>



<p><strong>It’s true even for the ambitious entrepreneur who’s contemplating partnering up with &#8220;that friend&#8221;. </strong></p>



<p>That person who you hit it off with at that conference last year… That person with what seems like the perfect skill set to go in 50/50 on this idea with. They&#8217;re already working on your idea and seem like the yin to your yang, because they appear to be a master of exactly the part of business you are <em>not!</em> </p>



<p>These hastily formed, breathlessly exciting partnerships almost <em>never</em> work out. Because no ones what they&#8217;re really getting into…</p>



<p><strong>Outsourcing weakness is difficult because “weakness” in business is a symptom of ignorance and inexperience.</strong> </p>



<p>And good outsourcing happens when pros have the knowledge and skills needed <em>to find and identify other pros</em> who’ll hit home runs on their behalf. </p>



<p>Any small business owner – who has gone deep in their specialization at the expense of everything else – has a whole saga of disastrous hires: Contractors, agencies and full blown employees who failed to deliver on promises or were outright scammers.</p>



<p>I’ve had it happen to me. If you’re a specialist, I’m sure you have too.  </p>



<p><strong>The real problem with “focus on strength, outsource weakness” is that it lets you off the hook. </strong></p>



<p>It’s too good to be true. </p>



<p>Nervous, aspiring entrepreneurs who are optimistic (but uninformed) heave a sigh of relief when they hear “outsource your weaknesses”.  <strong>As a principle, it gives you permission not to<em> think.</em> Instead you can<em> simply hope</em>. </strong></p>



<p>Maybe someone will come along and do it all: Fix everything. Make it all work. </p>



<p><em>Maybe I can close my eyes and this problem will go away. </em></p>



<p><em>Believing </em>in the principle of outsourcing weakness is the real psychological problem for entrepreneurs.  </p>



<p>If you start telling yourself it’s true, you start insidiously building a special kind of entrepreneurial <em>entitlement</em>: <strong>The resentment that comes from following what you believe to be a golden rule only to have it blow up in your face.</strong> Again and again.</p>



<p>“<em>I tried to focus on my strengths like I was supposed to, and it was a disaster!” </em></p>



<p>Now you know why it seldom works. </p>



<p><strong>It’s time to propose an alternative to the outsource-your-weakness golden rule…</strong></p>



<h2>Becoming “T Shaped and Dangerous” </h2>



<p>Credit to <a href="https://nicholasreese.com">my buddy Nick</a> for first putting this idea in my head and being the living embodiment of it himself. </p>



<p>T Shaped (and Dangerous… in a fun way!) is the concept of going deep into your very specific set of skills. And, having a solid grounding in the fundamentals of a wide range of disciplines needed to succeed in your business. </p>



<p><strong>The idea is to become a jack of all trades and a master of <em>one. </em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.commitaction.com/wp-content/uploads/t-shaped-dangerous.png" alt="T-shaped and dangerous" class="wp-image-6832"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>The benefits of being T Shaped are five-fold: </strong></p>



<ol><li>You can get a lot done – especially in the early stages of any project – on your own. </li><li>You <em>actually know</em> the limits of your skillset and precisely when to bring in help.</li><li>You know what to look for in your outsourcing and how to accurate assess the capabilities  of the people you seek help from. </li><li>You have the (criminally underrated) ability to attract top talent <em>that knows to look for a boss who isn’t totally clueless.</em> </li><li>Long term, you can manage and <em>lead</em> your team superbly. Specifically <em>because </em>their work isn’t mysterious wizardry to you, you can engage them and push them in just the right ways. </li></ol>



<p><strong>Number one saves you a ton of money. </strong></p>



<p>It’s almost impossible to overstate how much <em>time </em>number two will save you. So many business owners burn <em>months </em>of their precious time working on stuff that $100 spent on <a href="https://upwork.com">upwork.com</a> will get done in a two days. </p>



<p><strong>Number three saves you from being burned by predatory charlatans.</strong> It saves you from hiring and endlessly firing. It’s a magic pill for the worst headaches in business imaginable. </p>



<p>How many entrepreneurs have their biggest projects fatally delayed (or driven horribly over-budget) by an agency, contractor or team member who massively underestimated the complexity of the project? </p>



<p>The T Shaped entrepreneur is enough of a general technologist to spin up their own MVP landing pages. </p>



<p>They install their own WordPress themes. </p>



<p>They can tweak the php so that error on the checkout page – discovered on launch day – doesn’t require waiting for the contractor in another hemisphere to wake up to address. </p>



<p>Being T Shaped means knowing enough about marketing to be able to hire one of the few <em>genuinely good</em> PPC ad agencies. The ones that won’t just take your money to run some crappy ads for three months, only to ultimately conclude that your sales funnel or product “needs work” before ads can be profitable.</p>



<p><strong>The T Shaped startup founder knows how weird it is when regular humans talk with elite programmers. </strong></p>



<p>She gets how computer science minds work, what their values are and what kind work environment they crave. She knows how to position her project as particularly enticing, and knows exactly how to spec out a set of requirements and then get out of the way. </p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, <strong>being T Shaped means having the <em>financial literacy </em>to have an informed conversation with your bookkeeper and accountant.</strong> </p>



<p>If one of these professionals is any good, they have hundreds of other clients. And ideally many of them are <em>more successful</em> than you. They’re busy – you want them to be busy – because they’re good. This means<strong> they need <em>you</em> to ask them the right questions. </strong>Your prompts, curiosity and wacky ideas for tax strategy (how many square feet is your home office??) will push them to do their best work. </p>



<p>You’ll never, ever hire a great salesperson until you’ve proven out a reliable and repeatable sales strategy <em>yourself. </em></p>



<p>The best salespeople out there in the labor market are <em>actively looking</em> for businesses they can make big money with. They want a job where they can come in – ideally leveraging their existing rolodex – and make a ton of cash very quickly… for both themselves and for their boss. </p>



<p>Expert salespeople don’t want to reinvent the wheel. The number one thing they look for in a job is evidence that sales are already happening in the business. Who is the person who makes those evidence sales happen? It’s you.</p>



<ul><li><em>Design</em></li><li><em>Product Development</em></li><li><em>Shipping and Logistics</em></li><li><strong><em>… The list keeps going.</em></strong></li></ul>



<p>Even “management” itself is a big one. After all, what exactly is it that you are looking for when you hire someone to project manage your business… <em>if you’ve never been any good at project management yourself? </em></p>



<h2>How to become T Shaped and Dangerous yourself</h2>



<p>The only way to do this is to take yourself back to school. If you’re lusting after entrepreneurial success, you need to allocate both your time and some budget to <em>continued education</em>. And you need to take it seriously. </p>



<p><strong>Seek out those areas that make you uncomfortable.</strong> I’ll just call it right now: <strong>Sales</strong>, <strong>Marketing</strong> and <strong>Technology</strong> are the three biggest contenders for most folks. </p>



<p>Go take that hands on, learning-by-doing course. Buy the book. Actually read it. Khan Academy. There is no shortage of options. My buddy Nick took himself to systems architecture school (imagine!) to better understand and manage the complex technical projects he was leading, for his team. </p>



<p>Here at Commit Action, I run a webinar for our members each month hitting on topics from psychology (the down-stroke of my T), to marketing, finances, leadership and everything in between (all my horizontal skills). Members get access to these trainings included FREE with their <a href="https://commitaction.com">Commit Action membership</a>.</p>



<p>It’s never been easier or faster to gain a working knowledge of “the fundamentals”. <strong>The fact that so few people are willing to put the work in… is <em>precisely</em> what makes being T Shaped such a tremendous advantage to those who are willing to work at it. </strong></p>

<p>Ambitious people are hell-bent on time management. </p>



<p>Being on the quest for self improvement – particularly as an aspiring entrepreneur – is to be obsessed with optimizing the minutes of your day. </p>



<p><strong>Do <em>you</em> have the time optimization obsession? </strong></p>



<p>Morning rituals.</p>



<p>Color-coded calendars. </p>



<p>Elaborate daily planner/journals. </p>



<p>The latest beautifully designed to-do-list app. </p>



<p>Books about triaging your to-dos into your day plan. </p>



<p>Every single one of these strategies is held up by some guru. Each guru is always claiming their particular ritual as the “ultimate” hack. </p>



<p><strong>All these hacks are built on the same key assumption: </strong></p>



<p><em>That adding</em> <em>scrutiny and intention to how you spend your time each day is the key to being more successful. </em></p>



<h3>What if it’s not true? </h3>



<p>The funny thing about ultra successful entrepreneurs who’ve already made it big… is that seldom do any of this stuff. </p>



<p>I’ve frankly been <em>shocked</em> by how many extraordinarily successful people utterly ignore ALL these rituals of time management.In my years working as Shrink for Entrepreneurs – operating as the behind-the-curtain confidante and advisor to a luminary roster of elite founders – my best clients never did any of these things. </p>



<p>The contrast between my clients and other people is so severe that after over a decade of experience <strong>I see a correlation between obsessing over time management and floundering entrepreneur failure</strong>. In other words, these tactics and so called “hacks” appear to be games played by perpetual underachievers.</p>



<p>When I meet an entrepreneur with an elaborate series of time management rituals, my first question is always:</p>



<p> <em>“… and how’s that working out for you?”</em> </p>



<p><strong>It’s a trick question because I already know the answer. </strong></p>



<p>The whole reason we’re even talking is precisely because they’re unhappy with the results that their thinking and behavior is producing. </p>



<p>The real question you should be asking yourself: </p>



<p><strong><em>What are the elite few doing – while they’re succeeding unimaginably – INSTEAD of playing time management games? </em></strong></p>



<p>The answer is simple: </p>



<h3>They are managing their attention. </h3>



<p>Serially successful entrepreneurs become that way by setting up highly structured (even blinkered!) mental thought-scapes in which they work. To call it a precise “work environment” doesn’t do the concept justice. </p>



<p>Ultra successful entrepreneurs have a paradoxically low opinion of their own mind, in terms of their unconscious tendencies and abilities to self regulate and focus. </p>



<p><strong>They don’t trust themselves. </strong></p>



<p>They don’t trust themselves to perform incredible feats of focus and effectiveness by default. </p>



<p>This lack of trust is a good thing.</p>



<p>To combat it, <strong>they go to great lengths to paint themselves into tightly constrained mental “corners”</strong> from which they have no choice but to perform. </p>



<p>By directing and narrowing their attention to only the most significant priorities, then ruthlessly <em>managing </em>that attention to keep it there, these people are able to significantly outperform the average joe in both quantity and quality of work. </p>



<p>Instead of managing their time, they manage where their attention is <em>able </em>to go. </p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if you are brokering investment deals, scaling a startup, writing the next bestseller or leading a team.</p>



<p><strong>Managing your attention and focus, instead of worrying about time itself, is the best thing you can do to improve your productivity. </strong></p>



<p>Instead of a highly structured day in which many to-dos are triaged into the calendar and checked off, these entrepreneurs develop the <em>maniacal focus </em>that produces millions (and occasionally billions) in value. </p>



<p><strong>An ironic form of distrust – of oneself – is the key to managing your attention. </strong></p>



<p>Understanding that it’s absolutely <em>inevitable</em> that you’ll unconsciously switch trains of thought, get distracted, juggle dozens of competing ideas and generally self sabotage… is the first step. </p>



<p>The mistake most people make is believing they have to fight these internal tendencies. <strong>The real answer is to never even show up at the battleground. </strong></p>



<h3>Selectively limit your inputs</h3>



<p>This is the first and most essential step to successfully honing and developing super powers of attention and focus. Highly effective entrepreneurs plan and invest their energy to create closed mental “gardens” in their life and work environments.</p>



<p><strong>You can’t control your unconscious knee-jerk reactions to stimulus, but you can control the stimuli you expose yourself to.</strong></p>



<p>Social media and News are the obvious two “stimuli” to avoid or manage. </p>



<p>You can go deeper though: There’s a long history of high performers seeking out the company of other luminary thinkers – going on retreats etc – specifically to create an optimized mental <em>environment. </em></p>



<p><strong>In your own life, how much does input – even casual and conversational – from the people in your closest circles effect your productivity? </strong></p>



<p>What are you reading and how is that influencing where your attention flows? Ditto for what you’re watching on TV. </p>



<p><strong>We live in a more stimulated age than ever existed in human history</strong>. Our brains are fizzing and popping 24/7 with rich information input. Our cup runneth over. </p>



<p>It’s a mistake to pretend to yourself that this overwhelming firehose of mental stimulus isn’t real. It’s real and it’s here. If you’re serious about achieving big things, you need to put walls around your mental garden and think very carefully about what you’re letting in. </p>



<h3>Extraordinary prioritization is everything</h3>



<p>The biggest challenge the average entrepreneur faces – in their day-to-day effort to manage their attention – is fundamental confusion about what actually <em>matters</em>. </p>



<p>If you’re ready to construct your walled mental garden and severely limit the inputs your brain has to juggle… the next question is inevitable: </p>



<p><em>What should I allow IN?</em></p>



<p><strong>Highly successful entrepreneurs spend a tremendous amount of time and energy thinking about priorities. </strong>While others fiddle with schedules and color-coding categories of to-dos, high achievers ask themselves what <em>matters more than everything else</em>. </p>



<p><strong>You can’t have maniacal focus without maniacal prioritization. </strong></p>



<p>Thinking this way is uncomfortable for most people. Which is precisely why the vast majority are so bad at it. </p>



<p>Maniacal prioritization requires you to <em>abandon a tremendous number of areas of focus. </em>Not just hobbies and interests, but aspects of your business and projects that don’t serve as much as other’s too. </p>



<p>The 80/20 principle. The One Thing. These are all the fervent attempts of gurus and pundits who’ve seen the light – the magic of ruthless prioritization – and are trying to spread the good news. </p>



<p><strong>You have to genuinely pause and think, if you want to get this right.</strong></p>



<p>The final piece of the puzzle is the value placed on <strong>solitude, rest and deep thought</strong>. Bill Gates famously takes an annual reading and thinking vacation, alone. </p>



<p>Elite business performers the world over take time out to <em>evaluate themselves, their performance, their priorities and the work/life environments they construct around themselves. </em></p>



<p>Frantically operating in a state of perpetual busyness… is the <em>opposite </em>of good attention management. In this sense, managing your attention (instead of time) is a sort of applied mindfulness. </p>



<p>It’s about taking the time to remove the noise, think clearly and decide what really matters. You can start on that right now by pausing and giving yourself time to think. </p>



<p>Sales pitch: It works better when you have someone in your corner helping you do this. <a href="https://commitaction.com/">Our Commit Action Coaches are specialists</a> at facilitating precisely what we’re talking about here.  </p>
