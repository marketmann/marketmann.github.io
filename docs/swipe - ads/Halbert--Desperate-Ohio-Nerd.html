                        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
                        <p>If you would like to make alot of money very quickly, this is going to be the most exciting message you will ever read.</p>
                        <p>Here is why: my name is Gary Halbert and, some time ago, I was dead broke. My business wasalmost bankrupt and I couldn't even pay the rent. Actually, I wasn't just broke, I was <i>desperate</i>.</p>
                        <p>Then, one day, I came up with a "crazy idea" about how to write a certain kind of sales letter (it was <u>not</u> a chain letter) that would get people to send me money.</p>
                        <p>I was living in Ohio at the time and my friends laughed at the idea. They thought it was a big joke. They said I was a dreamer and that I had no "common sense." In fact, one guy said I was just a nerd and that my idea was so silly, he felt
                            sorry for me.</p>
                        <p>Oh yeah? Well, I didn't care. I still thought I had a good idea and I typed upa few of my letters and started mailing them out. And guess what? People <i>did</i> start sending me money. And I used that money to mail more letters which
                            brought in more money. And I used that to mail even more letters which brought&nbsp;in&nbsp;even&nbsp;more&nbsp;money.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;And so on.</p>

                        <p>Think about it: more than seven million people wrote back to me and every one of those people sent a check (made out to my wife) or else cash I could put in my pocket. And what was Iselling? Actually, it doesn't matter. You sec, the magic
                            was not in the product,&nbsp;<em>it was in the letter!</em></p>
                        <p>Do you have something to sell? If so, you can use that "crazy idea" I used in my letter to create a letter of your own and sell almost anything you've got.</p>

                        <h4><strong>How To Make Maximum Money In Minimum Time!</strong>
                        </h4>
                        <p>Listen: many years ago, I thought I wanted to be a salesman. I got myself a job selling encyclopedias doorto-doo r and I kept at it until I was darn good. But there was a problem. You see, I could only knock on about 40 doors each evening.
                            And therefore, no matter how hard I worked, there was a definite ceiling on my earning capacity.</p>
                        <p>And besides that, selling doorto-door is a <em>horrible</em> way to make a living!</p>
                        <p>So, I kept searching and searching until I came up with my "crazy letter idea" which is the first experience I ever had with what I call RCS or "Remote Control Selling."</p>
                        <p>RCS uses the secrets of something else I&nbsp;developed called "Killer Advertising" which almost&nbsp;<em>forces</em>&nbsp;people to buy&nbsp;<em>whatever</em>&nbsp;you are selling. And, what RCS lets you do is,
                            sell&nbsp;<em>almost</em>&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;without ever meeting your customers in person...&nbsp;<em>or even talking to them on the phone!</em></p>
                        <p>These "remote control" selling secrets of "Killer Advertising" can be used by anyone. Even a housewife, a student, or someone who is unemployed. And, if you have a business (or you want to have a business), these secrets can generate so
                            much cash-flow, you may actually have a hard time getting all the money to the bank. I'm not kidding. My "crazy letter idea," for example, brought in...</p>

                        <p>By the way, getting that many checks every day means you have to hire at least 30 full-time employees just to make your bank deposit. But anyway, my "crazy letter idea" isn't the only thing you'll learn when you read my book. No. *That's just Chapter One!</p>
