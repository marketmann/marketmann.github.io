<h1>Magic Copy List</h1>
<p>If was a fresh copy writer, and I wanted to "learn how to write copy—well—in a relatively short period of time," I'd want a "magic list."</p><p>On this list would be 1-5 books/resources/"things" that, by consuming, would tell me — in plain freaking english thank you very much—what master copywriters know, and how they use what they know.</p>
<p>I.e. I'd want a curated set of resources that — by me consuming —would give me the ability to write copy that made people buy AND... know.. explicitly why... that copy I wrote makes... people buy!</p>
<p>Haleluiah Zeus! </p>
<p>This... is that list.  Lucky you.</p>
<p>Behold.  These are the objectively best resources I've found on the subject of learning how to write copy. Well.  Why the "objectively best" you ask? (Great question fella! Pat on the back for asking.)</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong>they're "the best" because...</p>
<p>These resources, unlike all others I've purchased and read, or watched, or consumed, all break down the act of "writing copy" (well) into... an actual "system"</p>
<p>...an explicitly defined, repeatable system that shows you how to "write" copy (well), and more importantly, how to "think" about copy—before and while you're writing your own and, when you're reading other people's copy. (This is what you want).</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong>they're the <u><em>objectively</em></u> best because...</p>
<p>Despite being taught by different people, every resource below teaches you the same set of things—that master copy writers know and noobs don't. I.e. If I were a detective, I'd say, "golly Hank! All these 'resources' I'm reading... well,  all of them seem to magically cross-referencing each other.  They're all talking about the same thing!"</p>
<p>THis, you most definately want.</p>
