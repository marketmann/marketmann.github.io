    <h1 class="c6">Introduction</h1>
    <h2 class="c6">The Big Message Behind This Book:</h2>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s the single most important theme and idea for this guide:</p>
    <p class="c0">Copywriting is a language.</p>
    <p class="c0">Consider copywriting a &ldquo;professional language,&rdquo; like accounting.</p>
    <p class="c0">Accounting is considered &ldquo;the language of business.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c27">And copywriting has been referred to as &ldquo;salesmanship in print&hellip;&rdquo; So it makes sense to consider copywriting the &ldquo;language of sales.&rdquo; More specifically, it is the language of emotion.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because emotions are what make people buy things.</p>
    <p class="c0">For me, it has been effective to learn copywriting the way you&rsquo;d learn a new language, say Spanish.</p>
    <p class="c0">(For the purposes of this book, assume you absolutely cannot read or speak any Spanish.</p>
    <p class="c0">It will make all my examples a lot easier)</p>
    <p class="c0">If you&rsquo;ve never tried to learn a new language, here&rsquo;s how the education process usually goes&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">The instructors will start with some basics&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then they will add some stuff on top, while they continue to repeat and reinforce past lessons and basics over and over.</p>
    <p class="c0">It is the brute force repetition that makes the language stick.</p>
    <p class="c0">But nobody teaches copywriting as a language to practice.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead they teach it like putting together a piece of furniture.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Do this.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then do that.</p>
    <p class="c0">Fill in this template.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">We will not do that inside this guide.</p>
    <p class="c0">We will establish a few core principles, then expand on them over and over and over.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, you may find parts of this guide repetitive.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is by design.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once the emotions of the copywriting language are DRILLED into your memory through continuous practice and repetition...</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you really just need to consume as much of the language as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">Soon you&rsquo;ll start to recognize patterns&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then what started as reciting your &ldquo;ABC&rsquo;s&rdquo; and numbers &ldquo;one through ten&rdquo; will evolve into simple objects, then simple sentences&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Until you are ordering your own food at a restaurant and telling jokes in &ldquo;Spanish.&rdquo; This guide will help you develop skills in a similar way for copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">At first you will need to think about what you are doing&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But not for long.</p>
    <p class="c0">In no time it will all be second nature.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Most Gurus Only Get You Halfway There</h2>
    <p class="c0">Imagine if instead of teaching you Spanish, I just gave you some of the most common phrases Spanish people say and told you to &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; for whatever you need.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s what a lot of &ldquo;copywriting training&rdquo; has become.</p>
    <p class="c0">Email templates, headline templates&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Garbage.</p>
    <p class="c0">And sometimes gurus accidentally teach copywriting concepts without realizing that they are really speaking in jargon that comes loaded with assumptions that were never explained!</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s because from the outside, it looks like gurus are speaking in simple English when they teach&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s the deception of copywriting&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; appearance.</p>
    <p class="c27">For example, they say you should write &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; when you write your copy.</p>
    <p class="c27">But your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come automatically imbued with salesmanship&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c27">That is, your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t automatically create intrigue&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or automatically present a new and novel idea&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or automatically communicate a sense of safety, ease, or urgency or scarcity! You see, the language of copywriting is found in the subtext, not the text.</p>
    <p class="c0">Copywriting is an emotional language where the words on the page do not matter as much as you&rsquo;d think!</p>
    <p class="c0">Because the emotional part of the brain is triggered by the unwritten subtext.</p>
    <p class="c0">The subtext is inferred, not spoken.</p>
    <p class="c0">Put another way, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">If your words are conversational, but don&rsquo;t communicate important, specific subtext, then you are speaking English&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">NOT copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">If this sounds complicated, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide is designed specifically to clear all of that up for you.</p>
    <p class="c0">And it will also offer you all the tools you need to master the language of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">What&rsquo;s important is if you have been buying tons of books and courses only to find that your copywriting skills haven&rsquo;t improved&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
    <p class="c0">Nobody teaches this subject as what it is...</p>
    <p class="c0">A unique language of its own that requires continuous practice.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Why Templates And Regular Copywriting Books Fail You</h2>
    <p class="c0">So back to our Spanish example.</p>
    <p class="c0">Say you&rsquo;re ordering food at a restaurant.</p>
    <p class="c0">The server is speaking only in Spanish.</p>
    <p class="c0">You need help.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m there too, and I tell you exactly what to say to the server.</p>
    <p class="c0">You repeat what I taught you perfectly!</p>
    <p class="c0">Should you be happy?</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;re probably not satisfied.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because when you really think about it&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You only have the ability to say those couple words in that specific context, to that specific person, at that specific moment in time.</p>
    <p class="c0">And even though you recognized a few of the sounds from Spanish books you&rsquo;ve read, you still don&rsquo;t really understand what you or the server said in the first place&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And here&rsquo;s the real kicker&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You have no concept or system to help you understand <u class="c24">HOW I decided to say what I said, instead of</u>&nbsp;<u class="c24">saying something completely different...</u></p>
    <p class="c0">Sure, the words made sense after you heard them&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But how can you come up with them?</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s the problem with reading regular copywriting books and following templates.</p>
    <p class="c0">You KNOW that you are supposed to grab attention.</p>
    <p class="c0">You KNOW that you are supposed to build intrigue.</p>
    <p class="c0">You KNOW that you need to create urgency&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY?!?!?!?!?!</p>
    <p class="c0">How the hell do you make this influence trigger&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">TRIGGER?!</p>
    <p class="c0">So if you&rsquo;ve read a bunch of copywriting books and still lack total and complete confidence in your copywriting, now you know why.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
    <p class="c0">This book is going change that for you, once and for all.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">Becoming A Great Copywriter - The Daily Practice</h2>
    <p class="c0">To become a great copywriter, and to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting, there are three things you must do.</p>
    <p class="c0">I am &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; this checklist from Joe Schriefer, the publisher at Agora Financial and all around awesome dude.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Daily Practice:</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_7-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">Read a piece of copy a day</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Write a page of copy a day</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Come up with an idea a day</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="c6">Read a Piece of Copy a Day</h3>
    <p class="c0">When you read a piece of copy, you should practice &ldquo;active reading.&rdquo; Passive reading is what the majority of people do when they read.</p>
    <p class="c0">The passive reader just absorbs the material and questions nothing within.</p>
    <p class="c0">Your task as an active reader is to tease out subtext and try to infer the writer&rsquo;s purpose behind what was written.</p>
    <p class="c0">This entire guide is dedicated to teaching you professional level active reading skills.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Write a Page of Copy A Day</h3>
    <p class="c0">Writing a page of copy a day isn&rsquo;t as daunting as it sounds.</p>
    <p class="c0">Simply write a page of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for a big project, though it can be.</p>
    <p class="c0">It could be a series of five short emails that you sum up into one page.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you don&rsquo;t have to use this page of copy you wrote.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you want, you can throw your page away after you write it.</p>
    <p class="c0">You could also just hand-copy a page of copy from a successful copywriter.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes I do that, then active read and mark up what I wrote.</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t get too hung up on this stuff.</p>
    <p class="c0">The benefit is in the daily practice and engagement with the language of copywriting.</p>

    <h3 class="c6">Come Up With An Idea A Day</h3>
    <p class="c0">When coming up with an idea a day, you should not be hunting for a &ldquo;big idea.&rdquo; For instance, your one idea could be a simple way to improve a sales process&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">A cool subject line for an email&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It could be anything, really.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just try to stay in the habit of asking &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo; as often as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">I know you&rsquo;ll easily check this item off every day&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Everything in this guide will open your eyes and mind to a brand-new way of perceiving everything you read&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Particularly text within advertising and marketing materials.</p>
    <p class="c0">So you will have plenty of ideas.</p>
    <p class="c0">Of this I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">What You Should Expect From This Guide&hellip;</h2>
    <p class="c0">The purpose of this guide is to give you the tools you need to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting and expedite your progress towards mastery over the language.</p>
    <p class="c0">In this guide we will move through the common components of a full, long-form direct response sales letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">We will cover the subtext that must be communicated by the copywriter, with examples of how some of the best copywriters in the world do it.</p>
    <p class="c0">The lessons will build on each other, so easy to grasp patterns will emerge quickly for you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Before we cover the different sections of copy, I need to explain how to active read&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Without knowing what to look for and how to perform active reading, the rest of this guide is worthless.</p>
    
    <h1 class="c6">Active Reading- What To Look For When Reading A Piece of Copy</h1>
    <h2 class="c6">Copywriting is a language</h2>
    <p class="c0">Copywriting is a language communicated purely through subtext.</p>
    <p class="c0">Therefore, when you are reading copy you are not looking for clever turns of phrase or &ldquo;mind control lines.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The words aren&rsquo;t important.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.</p>
    <p class="c0">When reading a piece of copy, you are looking for what the copywriter is actually trying to communicate.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">How I Discovered the Language</h2>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that everything I&rsquo;m going to show you in this guide already helped me generate well over $7.1 million in sales in a single year as a copywriter at Agora Financial.</p>
    <p class="c0">And don&rsquo;t think for a minute that I had a clue what I was doing when I got hired.</p>
    <p class="c0">I probably knew less about copywriting than you know now.</p>
    <p class="c0">I was as green as they come.</p>
    <p class="c0">But I was eager to learn copywriting fast so I could make a million bucks, so I asked this question on my first day:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;What books should I read? I&rsquo;ve read The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert and The Ultimate Sales Letter by Dan Kennedy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">What else?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The reply:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to read any of that stuff&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t read about copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just read copy.&rdquo; That was a disappointing answer for me at the time&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But it has turned out to be the most fundamental truth about learning copywriting fast&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And the most important step to becoming a great copywriter.</p>
    <p class="c0">Lesson:</p>
    <p class="c0">If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about Spanish&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Simply read Spanish.</p>
    <p class="c0">And if you want to learn how to speak copywriting, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about copywriting&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Just read copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">The fastest way to normalize the language of copywriting, and internalize it in your brain, is to read it every single day.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">&ldquo;Actively&rdquo; Read a Piece of Copy a Day</h2>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not good enough to simply read a piece of copy every day.</p>
    <p class="c0">You must practice active reading.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is, you read with purpose.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll read with pen in hand, discovering and marking patterns that will make writing your own copy much, much easier...</p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll look for new and novel lines the writer used that will inspire new, original ideas for when you&rsquo;re writing your own copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide is going to give you the tools to perform active reading like a champ.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">It&rsquo;s All About The Patterns&hellip;</h2>
    <p class="c0">Since I work in direct response and typically write long-form sales letters, that&rsquo;s where our focus will be.</p>
    <p class="c0">But don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even if you don&rsquo;t write long-form sales letters, you can rest assured that the emotions you will learn in just a moment will make you great at any style or length of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because this guide is not designed to tell you WHAT to write.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead you&rsquo;ll learn how to speak the language itself&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide will shine a light on the secret patterns of the copywriting language, and soon they will be second nature to you.</p>
    <p class="c0">I can&rsquo;t stress enough:</p>
    <p class="c0">Recognizing patterns is one of the most critical lessons of reading copywriting daily.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">Binging Copywriting And The Walking Dead</h2>
    <p class="c0">So here&rsquo;s an example&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I used to love watching &ldquo;The Walking Dead.&rdquo; Until I binged a season or two in a matter of days.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then I could predict almost exactly when the zombies would appear&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And I knew the elements that would lead right up to the characters becoming trapped and then narrowly escaping.</p>
    <p class="c0">I picked up on cues in the directing that gave away what was coming because the set ups were always so similar.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, after binging two seasons, I felt like I could write an episode myself.</p>
    <p class="c0">Opening scene&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">So and so is injured or incapacitated in some way&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">we need supplies / or a specific rare item&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Go on supply run&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">everything is fine&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">supply run goes bad/some idiot makes a loud noise&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Zombies appear out of nowhere&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">roof falls in&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">heroes are overwhelmed by army of zombies suddenly&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Someone gets grabbed&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">they almost get bit&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">they narrowly escape.</p>
    <p class="c0">You just change the characters and locations&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And with some limited exceptions, the chain of events I just described appeared in similar fashion regularly in the show (from what I remember).</p>
    <p class="c0">And it isn&rsquo;t that The Walking Dead creators aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;clever&rdquo; enough.</p>
    <p class="c0">They knew exactly how to speak to their viewers&rsquo; emotions and captivate their audience.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the show is so successful.</p>
    <p class="c0">But it&rsquo;s also why some regular patterns emerged.</p>
    <p class="c0">You want to expedite your ability to recognize and deconstruct those types of patterns in copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">The language of copywriting is designed for one function: to speak directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">So the sooner you can recognize the patterns within the language, the sooner YOU can manipulate those patterns to do the same yourself.</p>
    <p class="c0">If I wanted to write my own episode of The Walking Dead I&rsquo;d binge episodes of The Walking Dead and copy what works.</p>
    <p class="c0">Same thing with copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you &ldquo;binge&rdquo; enough copy, it takes the work out of writing it.</p>
    <p class="c0">The words will flow from you naturally.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll just know what should come next.</p>
    <p class="c0">As some folks put it, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Before You Can Ever Perform Active Reading</h2>
    <p class="c0">Unfortunately, you cannot simply binge copywriting and recognize the patterns.</p>
    <p class="c0">It won&rsquo;t work.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember, copywriting is a completely foreign language...</p>
    <p class="c0">It is the hidden subtext that speaks directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can&rsquo;t just read the words and pick it up.</p>
    <p class="c0">The critical reading skills you learned in school won&rsquo;t help you here.</p>
    <p class="c0">So humble yourself now&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Do not think because copy is written in simple, basic, English words that it can be understood via traditional reading comprehension.</p>
    <p class="c0">Without a decoder like this guide, binging copywriting would be like trying to read a million Spanish novels without some way to translate.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even if you binge read all the Spanish novels in the world, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand anything more about the language without a way to translate it.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you would be no closer to your goal of speaking Spanish fluently.</p>

    <h2 class="c6">Copywriting. Must. Be. Translated.</h2>
    <p class="c0">There is a TON going on &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; in copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Smoke and mirrors stuff.</p>
    <p class="c0">You think you are reading one thing&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">but you really are not.</p>
    <p class="c0">And often, if you aren&rsquo;t very specifically searching and actively reading&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You may totally overlook a sales trigger or persuasion tactic that is subliminally being planted.</p>
    <p class="c0">Active reading allows you to break down a piece of copy and pull out those tricks.</p>
    <p class="c0">Active reading is a &ldquo;translator&rdquo; for teasing the subliminal subtext (i.e.</p>
    <p class="c0">the REAL messages) out of the copy.</p>
    <p class="c6 c3">&nbsp;</p>
    <h1 class="c6">&ldquo;The Big 4&rdquo; &ndash; The Subtext Beneath All Copywriting</h1>
    
    <p class="c0">In just a moment we will go deeper into active reading and dive into the different sections of copy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But first, you must understand four crucial emotions and how they operate within a work of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because these four emotions are present in the entire body of copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">From the first word of the headline, down to last word in the P.S..</p>
    <p class="c0">Every word of copywriting is specifically designed and choreographed to serve what I call: The &ldquo;The Big 4.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Basically, in great copy there are four main sentiments or emotions you want to trigger in your reader&rsquo;s mind&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">These 4 do that&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or &ldquo;are&rdquo; that.</p>
    <p class="c0">And each of The Big 4 comes in a pair.</p>
    <p class="c0">Think of each item as having an &ldquo;alter ego.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The alter ego is similar to the original emotion, but dressed up and comes with super powers.</p>
    <p class="c0">Like Clark Kent and Superman.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or Peter Parker and Spider-Man if you prefer Marvel (I do)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Anyways, you get it.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.1fob9te">When applied correctly, alter egos can function as persuasion multipliers, or &ldquo;amplifiers.&rdquo; I know, this might sound complicated, but trust me, it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.3znysh7">I promise.</p>
    <p class="c0">Look&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here are The Big 4:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_26-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">New</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Easy</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Safe</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Big</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">And here they are with their alter egos attached:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_26-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">New/Only</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Easy/Anybody</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Safe/Predictable</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Big/Fast</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="c6">NESB</h2>
    <p class="c0">A quick and easy mnemonic device you can use to recall the Big 4 is NESB (nes-bee).</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s dive into these, because they are the gas that drives every word of the copywriting machine.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Big 4 are the subtext overlooked while regular people are reading copy with their&hellip; regular eyes.</p>
    <p class="c0">I hope you&rsquo;re excited&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This is your first step into translating the incredible and powerful language of copywriting.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">New</h2>
    <p class="c0">New is the single most important emotion to drive a successful piece of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">People are highly skeptical of advertising and they have very short attention spans.</p>
    <p class="c0">The most direct way to combat their fickle attention is to put something &ldquo;new and novel&rdquo; in front of them.</p>
    <p class="c0">It must be something they&rsquo;ve truly never seen before...</p>
    <p class="c0">Or they will walk away from your pitch before you can even make it.</p>
    <p class="c0">To frame how important &ldquo;New&rdquo; is&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Just remember this phrase: &ldquo;categorization is DEATH.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">If the reader ever feels they can label your message as something they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;seen before&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or even label your message as SIMILAR to something they&rsquo;ve seen before&hellip;</p>

    <p class="">They think: <strong><u>“This is just like that thing I saw yesterday…”</u></strong> </p>
    <p class="">Then you and your copy are DEAD.</p>
    <p class="c0">BURIED.</p>
    <p class="c0">Treat &ldquo;New&rdquo; with that level of mortal seriousness.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
    <p class="c0">I cannot stress this enough.</p>
    <p class="c0">Your reader must never be able to say, &ldquo;I know exactly what this is, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo; Copywriting speaks directly toward the emotional center of the brain.</p>
    <p class="c0">The &ldquo;lizard brain&rdquo; as some call it.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that is the most fickle and lazy part of the brain.</p>
    <p class="c0">It does NOT want to spend any effort on attention.</p>
    <p class="c0">The lizard brain wants to quickly categorize anything that crosses its path as either a threat, something to eat, or something to ignore.</p>
    <p class="c0">That way it can go back to doing nothing.</p>
    <p class="c0">Do NOT let the lizard brain categorize your copywriting as something to ignore.</p>
    <p class="c0">You combat that by weaving New into the subtext of your copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide will purposefully not offer you &ldquo;step 1, 2, 3,&rdquo; to accomplish this.</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide will not tell you what to write.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember, this guide is your translator&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It will help you recognize the patterns hidden in the subtext of the words that you once thought were just regular words.</p>
    <p class="c0">And now you know about this one, single emotion, &ldquo;New&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You will now see the following words POP out at your face and smack you in the eye balls when you look at copy&hellip;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_24-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Breakthrough</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Revolutionary</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Discovery</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Game Changing</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Disruptive</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">NEW</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Announcing</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Revealed</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Breaking</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ve probably seen these words listed as &ldquo;power words&rdquo; in a blog post before.</p>
    <p class="c0">But what is their power? What does it matter?</p>
    <p class="c0">They convey &ldquo;New&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="c0">They tell the lizard brain, &ldquo;Hey, ya bastard.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can&rsquo;t categorize and ignore me.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;ve gotcha.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And now your brain will automatically translate these &ldquo;regular words&rdquo; for what they really mean&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">The subtext they really convey&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And you will immediately understand their true purpose in copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">They tell the reader, &ldquo;You actually have NOT seen this before.</p>
    <p class="c0">Keep reading to discover what it is&hellip;&rdquo; Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll understand what the copywriter who wrote them understands&hellip;</p>
    <p id="cat-1" class="c0"><strong class=""><u>&ldquo;Categorization is DEATH.</u>&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">If something is breakthrough, it is new.</p>
    <p class="c0">If it is revolutionary&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">It is new.</p>
    <p class="c0">If it is a game changer&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">it is new.</p>
    <p class="c0">Again, all these words convey, &ldquo;You do not know what this is because it is brand new.&rdquo;</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Why Is &ldquo;New&rdquo; So Important?</h3>
    <p class="c0">We&rsquo;re going to go just a little deeper than I planned&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But I think this is very, very important.</p>
    <p class="c0">This touches on the psychology of the reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you are offering a widget to a reader, you are offering them some sort of &ldquo;value.&rdquo; The &ldquo;value&rdquo; is that your widget solves a problem or provides some benefit.</p>
    <p class="c0">Basic stuff, right?</p>
    <p class="c0">And that&rsquo;s where many copywriting guides might stop, but not this one...</p>
    <p class="c0">If you are selling a problem solver widget, chances are your reader has had this problem for a while&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And what&rsquo;s worse&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Nothing has ever worked for them before.</p>
    <p class="c0">They&rsquo;ve probably bought a widget for this problem before, and it failed them.</p>
    <p class="c0">So they still have the problem&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">They are now keenly aware and averse to what doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And they are still looking for that magic bullet / magic pill / one secret that will finally solve their problem.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you put the &ldquo;same&rdquo; solution that they&rsquo;ve seen before, they KNOW there is no hope that it will work.</p>
    <p class="c0">They have tried that.</p>
    <p class="c0">And they assume that to indulge in reading your copy will just result in more disappointment.</p>
    <p class="c0">So they won&rsquo;t waste their time.</p>
    <p class="c0">But if the copy conveys this is BRAND NEW, then there is hope for them.</p>
    <p class="c0">This could be the thing.</p>
    <p class="c0">This could finally be it.</p>
    <p class="c0">Finally, the solution to their problems.</p>
    <p class="c0">Something new = hope.</p>
    <p class="c0">So the emotion of New isn&rsquo;t just about holding attention to learn what the new thing is.</p>
    <p class="c0">Many beginner copywriters believe intrigue alone will propel readers to continue reading.</p>
    <p class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not New&rsquo;s true purpose.</p>
    <p class="c0">New isn&rsquo;t just a set of &ldquo;power words.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though New does hold attention, and New does have power&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s power comes from one thing NOBODY talks about&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">New offers &ldquo;hope.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Hope that finally, the one thing that they have been searching for is in front of them.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">New and Novel</h3>
    <p class="c0">One more thing on the topic of New&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">New is NEW and NOVEL.</p>
    <p class="c0">New is NOT just a &ldquo;better version of xyz.&rdquo; Do not get the two confused.</p>
    <p class="c0">As the famous copywriter, Ryan McGrath, taught me at Agora Financial: New and different is better than &ldquo;better.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a couple lines of real life copywriting that demonstrate New&hellip;</p>

                    <p class="c0">The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now...</p>
                    <p class="c0">----------------------------------</p>
                    <p class="c0">This excerpt is from a sales letter by Money Map Press.</p>
                    <p class="c0">The headline is:</p>
                    <p class="c0 text-centered"><strong class="c13 ">Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker</strong></p>

    <p class="c0">Sound like something you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;heard before?&rdquo; Probably not.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is a &ldquo;world-changing new liquid.&rdquo; New.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">New&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Only&rdquo;</h2>
    <p class="c0">Only is a very simple emotion to grasp&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You can &ldquo;Only get this solution here, through me, on this page.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">To say you can only get something on this page means&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t bought this before on this page, then you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; To say you can only get something through me, means it is unique and proprietary to me.</p>
    <p class="c0">So the subtext is, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t sell you this thing, you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; These ideas convey the same sentiment as &ldquo;New.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Which, again, is: &ldquo;this is different.&rdquo; But more powerfully.</p>
    <p class="c0">Only amplifies New.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.tyjcwt">New is Peter Parker and Only is Spider-Man.</p>
    <p class="c0">Got it?</p>
    <p class="c0">Here are some key words that should jump out and let you know the subtext of the copywriting is communicating the Only emotion:</p>
    
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_24-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Exclusive</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Patented</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Only here</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Proprietary</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be able to automatically translate these words for what they really mean&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Because you understand that these are not just &ldquo;power words&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">But that these words convey the benefit of exclusiveness&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">They convey New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Nothing is as important as New.</p>
    <p class="c0">New is the source of hope.</p>
    <p class="c0">Tap into that, and you have already won.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example of Only taken from my first front-end promo I wrote for James Altucher and his service, The Altucher Report, at Agora Financial.</p>
    <p class="c0">The promo was called, The Hottest IPO.</p>

            <tr class="c34">
                <td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1">
                    <p class="c0">Dear Reader,</p>
                    <p class="c0">See this document I&rsquo;m holding in my hand? It&rsquo;s called The Pre-IPO Prospectus.</p>
                    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s the only document in the world that contains details of a pre-IPO strategy that could help you make a fortune from this private company&rsquo;s explosive growth&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="c0">BEFORE it goes public!</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p class="c0">Right away we establish that this is a brand New opportunity that is Only available through us!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Easy</h2>
    <p class="c0">Nobody likes work.</p>
    <p class="c0">If they did, everyone you knew when you were little and at school would be massively successful and rich today.</p>
    <p class="c0">If for some reason I can&rsquo;t get you to totally believe that nobody likes work, then let&rsquo;s compromise at this: Anybody who loves work is not reading your copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">They&rsquo;re working.</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, now you know copywriters only need to concern themselves with writing to people who want an easy, &ldquo;work-free&rdquo; solution to their problems&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You can easily grasp the Easy emotion.</p>
    <p class="c0">Folks want a push-button solution.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or they want the &ldquo;single, simple trick to 10x their results.&rdquo; There are two reasons for this:</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_25-2 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">They are lazy</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">They are insecure</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="c6">Lazy</h3>
    <p class="c0">The first one is obvious, and probably the first thought that came to your mind immediately.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can reduce a reader&rsquo;s &ldquo;workload&rdquo; and play into their laziness by making the solution take very little time&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;Six minute abs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or by creating a system&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or step-by-step solution&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or by making it push-button&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The second reason, they are insecure, goes a little deeper into psychology.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Insecure</h3>
    <p class="c0">You see, like the New emotion, there is a chance that your prospect has tried something similar to what you&rsquo;re offering now&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And it failed them.</p>
    <p class="c0">Maybe they blamed the products they bought.</p>
    <p class="c0">But maybe, at a deeper level, they blamed themselves.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not smart enough.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich enough.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too ugly, too short, too fat, too bald, too oily, too weak&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">So a writer can multiply the effect of Easy by making things easy enough that Anybody can do it.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that is where Easy&rsquo;s alter ego comes in.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Easy&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Anybody&rdquo;</h2>
    <p class="c0">When you convey that &ldquo;anybody can do xyz,&rdquo; you are conveying that the process has been dumbed down for the lowest common denominator.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though people may think they are bad at something, they never believe that they are the dumbest or worst person on the planet.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">So you can quickly and easily convey that something is easy enough for them&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Despite their insecurities and shortcomings&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">By conveying that it is so fool-proof that Anybody can use this solution and still get incredible results.</p>
    <p class="c0">This leads us to what are known as &ldquo;Not Statements.&rdquo;</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Not Statements</h3>
    <p class="c0">Not statements have two uses.</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_28-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c32">Build intrigue</li>
        <li class="c32">Convey Easy/Anybody</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c0">The first use of Not Statements is to build intrigue.</p>
    <p class="c0">Use this when your reader might THINK they know what you&rsquo;re talking about already, but then you say&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;I can easily help you get abs in 6 days with this breakthrough technique&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not muscle confusion.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not power lifting.</p>
    <p class="c0">And it&rsquo;s not cardio&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You want your reader left thinking, &ldquo;Well shit&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">What is it?!&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s the intrigue side of Not Statements.</p>
    <p class="c0">The other primary use of Not Statements is to directly employ the Easy / Anybody emotions&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You can earn $1,000 a week in passive income starting next Monday&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And you don&rsquo;t have to be a financial genius, or even have finished high school.</p>
    <p class="c0">You don&rsquo;t have to have any coding or web experience, you could get started in the next five minutes with nothing but an internet connection.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you don&rsquo;t have to have a lot money&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">all you need is $10!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">What not statements do in this context is provide the reader with the certainty that the solution is not too difficult for them.</p>
    <p class="c0">In other words, the reader doesn&rsquo;t have to do any real work and they are already over-qualified.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now when you read copywriting, I expect the REAL meaning behind the following words and phrases to POP out at you&hellip;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_24-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Easy</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Anybody</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Simple</li>
        <li>1, 2, 3</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Push-button</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Automatic</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Fool-proof</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Step-by-step</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">System</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">All you have to do is&hellip;</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">All you needed to do&hellip;</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Simply follow the steps&hellip;</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Not statements</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">You don&rsquo;t need&hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Now you know that the copywriter is pushing the Easy/Anybody emotion into action.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;This solution will not require work from you&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And it is not too complicated to be beyond your reach.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can do this.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Easy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example of Easy at play in Money Map&rsquo;s promo for &ldquo;The Money Zone.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="c0">In this copy, I&rsquo;m taking the most common hurdles a reader might bring up immediately and knocking them out line by line.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m letting them know: &ldquo;Anybody can do this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Safe</h2>
    <p class="c0">To capture attention, copywriters are forced to put some pretty bold promises in front of their readers.</p>
    <p class="c0">Unfortunately, what the copywriters gain in attention with bold promises also comes handcuffed to additional skepticism.</p>
    <p class="c0">To state the obvious, skepticism makes a copywriter&rsquo;s job more difficult&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But a smart copywriter can fight that skepticism with the right tools.</p>
    <p class="c0">But before we get into those&hellip;</p>
    
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.1t3h5sf">A Hidden Benefit of Safe</h3>
    <p class="c0">Employing the Safe emotion will combat reader skepticism&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And it will also make your offer more appear more VALUABLE to your reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">Psychology studies have shown that when people consider something &ldquo;risky,&rdquo; they also judge that thing&rsquo;s benefits as less valuable.</p>
    <p class="c0">Conversely, when folks deem something as &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; they automatically attribute higher value to that thing&rsquo;s benefits.</p>
    <p class="c0">This might feel counterintuitive to the real world, where higher risk usually comes tied to higher potential rewards, but copywriters are not selling to logical beings&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">They are selling to people.</p>
    <p class="c0">So knowing what we know about irrational people, the Safe emotion serves two goals:</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_22-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">It makes the reader less skeptical about your offer, thereby making the reader more open to the idea of buying</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">By reducing risk, Safe automatically increases the reader&rsquo;s perceived value of your offer, because studies have shown that things people perceive as &ldquo;less risky&rdquo; are perceived as &ldquo;more valuable&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c0">That makes Safe a very powerful emotion.</p>
    <p class="c0">And since it has two benefits, it has exponential returns for copywriters!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6" id="h.4d34og8">Risk Aversion</h2>
    <p class="c0">Studies have shown that people are risk averse.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Risk averse basically means people would rather avoid a loss than pursue a gain.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is sort of common knowledge in the persuasion community.</p>
    <p class="c0">But what does that mean for us, practically as copywriters? What does that mean for our Big 4 emotions?</p>
    <p class="c0">The best way to understand it is to view an example from a real psychology study&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">A set of subjects had two choices.</p>
    <p class="c0">Choice one, they could take &ldquo;a gamble.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The gamble option was an 80% chance to win $100 with a 20% chance to win $10.</p>
    <p class="c0">To help you visualize what that means&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Imagine the gamble option as a scratch-off lottery ticket with 10 squares.</p>
    <p class="c0">Eight squares are worth $100 and two squares are worth $10.</p>
    <p class="c0">But you can only scratch one square.</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, got that visual?</p>
    <p class="c0">Good.</p>
    <p class="c0">The other choice people had besides the gamble option was a sure thing of $80, guaranteed.</p>
    <p class="c0">The results?</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.2s8eyo1">Most people take the $80.</p>
    <p class="c0">Mathematically, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
    <p class="c0">A statistician would tell you the value of the gamble was $82.</p>
    <p class="c0">$100 X .8 + $10 *.2 = $82.</p>
    <p class="c0">Logically, the gamble is worth more.</p>
    <p class="c0">But we aren&rsquo;t dealing with logical beings.</p>
    <p class="c0">We are dealing with people.</p>
    <p class="c0">And even if you aren&rsquo;t a math whiz, turning down an 80% chance at $100 is a tough option to turn down.</p>
    <p class="c0">Especially when the lowest possible outcome was to still win $10&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">UNLESS you are a human being who places incredible value on CERTAINTY.</p>
    <p class="c0">Fact is, most people in this experiment would rather &ldquo;pay a premium&rdquo; or &ldquo;take a discounted payout&rdquo; in exchange for CERTAINTY.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Even though an 80% chance at $100 is pretty damn good odds.</p>
    <p class="c0">People would rather sacrifice 20 potential dollars and take a guaranteed $80.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just because it&rsquo;s Safe.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though the worst-case scenario came in at a minority 20% chance&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Folks totally threw out the logical, and more attractive offer of an 80% shot at a better payout of $100.</p>
    <p class="c0">What does this mean for you, as a copywriter?</p>
    <p class="c0">It means your reader is very much invested in eliminating as much risk as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember when we said the Safe emotion increases PERCEIVED value of your offer? Here&rsquo;s your proof&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Given two valuable options, people would prefer the LESS VALUABLE option ($80 instead of $100)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">As long as it is LESS RISKY (100% vs 80% chance).</p>
    <p class="c0">They perceive the more Safe option as more desirable, even though it is in fact, less valuable.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just to feel that sense of Safe.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Safe&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo;</h2>
    <p class="c0">There&rsquo;s a powerful way to jack up the level of Safe a reader feels.</p>
    <p class="c0">If a copywriter can convey that something follows a Predictable pattern&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">That the opportunity follows in-step with something similar that has happened before&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or that this opportunity or its benefits are &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; then readers will perceive that thing as even more &ldquo;Safe.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Showing patterns inside credibility, track record, testimonials, case studies, success stories, etc., demonstrates that &ldquo;xyz result&rdquo; is more &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The subtext conveyed is that the last time something like &ldquo;A&rdquo; happened in history, &ldquo;B&rdquo; was the result.</p>

                    <p class="c0">Today, Company B&rsquo;s stock has just dropped 800 points and guess who they hired as CEO&hellip;? That&rsquo;s right, CEO Frank.</p>
                    <p class="c0">You already know what&rsquo;s bound to happen next for Company B&rsquo;s investors in just a matter of time.</p>

    <p class="c0">If you can set up the pattern to be obvious&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then let the READER predict or infer what will happen next like in the made up example above&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Then the reader is actually SELLING THEMSELVES on the opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">So that was just one made up example.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;ll once again remind you that the words you choose are not as important as the subtext they convey.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s why this guide does not say, &ldquo;write copy this way.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You write whatever words help you convey Safe and Predictable.</p>
    <p class="c0">And now that you understand the emotion of Safe and its alter ego Predictable&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You can automatically translate the following words and phrases when you see them for what they really mean: &ldquo;This is Safe, therefore it is exceptionally beneficial and valuable.&rdquo;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_24-0">
        <li class="c6 c8" id="h.17dp8vu">Happened before</li>

                    <p class="c0">To do this you would have to place a special and very obscure options play on the S&amp;P, which as you know is not a stock but rather the heartbeat of the market itself.</p>

    <p class="c0">Notice the copywriter actually gave the level of Safe a numerical value&hellip; 93% certainty.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">How Predictable is this benefit? 93%.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is a great time to explain why the writer would not WANT to claim 100% certainty&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">A 100% claim in the stock market is simply unbelievable.</p>
    <p class="c0">The entire world would be turned upside down if one person could figure out how to never miss a single opportunity in the stock market.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everybody in the world would be breaking down doors to get that solution and its value would clearly be infinity dollars, since you could never lose money.</p>
    <p class="c0">Therefore, a 100% certainty claim would actually create more skepticism, not less.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s up to you to draw that line in your copy, depending on your niche and product offering.</p>
    <p class="c0">I will mention I have seen a &ldquo;type&rdquo; of 100% claim in financial copywriting before.</p>
    <p class="c0">In Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heatseekers&rdquo; promo&hellip; </p>
    
    <p class="c0">The headline read:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image21.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Using the track record in this way infers Safe and Predictable without guaranteeing it.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Big</h2>
    <p class="c0">Big generally refers to the size of the opportunity at hand.</p>
    <p class="c0">This emotion communicates that the opportunity in front of the reader is extremely important, groundbreaking, and rewarding.</p>
    <p class="c0">Big is probably the most abstract emotion of the four.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">It can take many forms &ndash; but it can also be directly stated in copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Also, the other three emotions can directly feed into Big...</p>
    <p class="c0">If something is New, it could be disruptive.</p>
    <p class="c0">A disruption is usually Big.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">&ldquo;The last time something like this happened, it was extremely disruptive&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That also weaves Predictability in the mix, since we infer we have seen something similar when we say &ldquo;the last time.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">(That&rsquo;s pretty cool, huh? Soon you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up on these patterns as you binge copywriting).</p>
    <p class="c0">A writer can weave Easy into Big by saying something like:</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">“This is so easy you’ll never trade stocks the same way again.”</p>
    <p class="c0">So you see, the emotions can work in harmony.</p>
    <p class="c0">Big is important, because it demands attention.</p>
    <p class="c0">It infers change, and that is usually why someone reads your copy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Because they want a change.</p>
    <p class="c0">And Big works especially well when coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO).</p>
    
    <h3 class="c6">Fear of Missing Out</h3>
    <p class="c0">Big lends itself easily to FOMO.</p>
    <p class="c0">For example&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c18 c-indented">&ldquo;Do you want to miss out on the chance to invest in the next Google/Amazon/Facebook? Because that&rsquo;s how much money is at stake&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The reader might feel: &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty big.</p>
    <p class="c0">I should pay attention.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Big&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Fast&rdquo;</h2>
    <p class="c0">It is important that the reader feel like they are standing at the foot of a mountain of opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">This single thing can improve your life 10,000%.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0 ">The only thing better than something that big&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;This single thing can improve your life 10,000% overnight&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s great to see your money grow 10,000%...</p>
    <p class="c0">To see your strength improve 10,000%...</p>
    <p class="c0">To see your skin look 10,000% silkier and younge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">But what&rsquo;s better than those Big changes?</p>
    <p class="c0">All &nbsp;of that stuff in a matter of seconds, minutes, days&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.3rdcrjn">Not years.</p>
    <p class="c0">So Fast multiplies the Big of your offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">Knowing this, you can automatically translate the following phrases&hellip;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_24-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Big</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Fast</li>

        <li class="c6 c8">Overnight</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Weekly</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll know that Big commands attention&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">It triggers FOMO&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And the only thing better than Big is getting something Big NOW.</p>

                    <p class="c0" id="h.26in1rg">Hello, I&#39;m Dr. Kent Moors.</p>
                    <p class="c0">I&#39;m reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history...</p>
                    <p class="c0">And the last time was more than a century ago.</p>
                    <p class="c0">The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now...</p>
                    <p class="c0">Even as you read this, these trucks are rolling out of a small American company&#39;s nondescript &ndash; yet highly secure &ndash; production facility in the Midwest.</p>
                    <p class="c0">Why all the secrecy and security?</p>
                    <p class="c0">I&#39;ll explain that fully in just a moment.</p>
                    <p class="c0">But the crux of it is that this tiny company has pioneered an incredible new &quot;polymorphic&quot; substance...</p>

    <p class="c0">&nbsp;Tickling the FOMO trigger.</p>
    <p class="c0">I LOVE this excerpt because you can find a strong presence of New, Safe, and Big in these few short sentences.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because this promo is not offering a &ldquo;system&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; for the reader to follow, it doesn&rsquo;t lean too much on the Easy emotion.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
    <p class="c0">Every line of copy doesn&rsquo;t have to have all four emotions.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll start to recognize that as you begin binging copy on your own.</p>
    <p class="c0">And remember, if you want the full promo for any of the excerpts I&rsquo;ve shown, you can have them totally free at: <a class="c29" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.kylethewriter.com/swipe&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1581031305073000">www.kylethewriter.com/swipe</a></p>
    
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Summing Up The Big 4 Emotions&hellip;</h2>
    <p class="c0">Now that you understand that an entire body of copy is driven by four main emotions and their alter egos&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I think you are ready to dive into the nuances of the different sections of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">There are also four of them, too.</p>
    <p class="c0">But no cool name this time (maybe there will be when I write the second edition of this book).</p>
    
    
    
    <h1 class="c6">The Four Sections of Copy</h1>
    <p class="c0">All words in a piece of copy are not created equal.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember that the Big 4 should be weaved into virtually every line of copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And aside from those emotions, specific words have specific roles to play, depending on what section of the copy they are in.</p>
    <p class="c0">There is an order to a sales letter, and that is important.</p>
    <p class="c0">Abandon the order, and the copy doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense.</p>
    <p class="c0">So think of it like this&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">In English we say: &ldquo;The red apple.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">In Spanish it&rsquo;s reversed; &ldquo;La manzana roja.&rdquo; Translated literally: &ldquo;The apple red.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">If you screw around with the order, the meaning isn&rsquo;t totally lost&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But it sure is mangled.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that is bad for keeping the attention of busy and skeptical readers.</p>
    <p class="c0">So to simplify everything, let&rsquo;s break the copy into four sections&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And we will have specific things to look for in each section while we are actively reading&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">The four sections of copy are:</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_6-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">The headline</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">The lead</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">The body</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">The offer</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c0">Before we dive in, remember the goal of this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This guide is meant to decode the language of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">It will be the tool that allows you to decipher the subtext in each section of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">You just need to know what to look for&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">So in this upcoming section you&rsquo;ll get a brand new method to help you perform active reading.</p>
    <p class="c0">As you learn the framework for copywriting in this next section&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll also learn to TRANSLATE the subliminal messages of the copywriting language into &ldquo;plain English.&rdquo; It will seem like I&rsquo;m telling you WHAT to write, but that is not our goal with this.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m teaching you how to TRANSLATE what you are reading&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you will be able to accomplish the greater goal of &ldquo;binging&rdquo; good copywriting&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">You want to learn how to effectively BINGE.</p>
    <p class="c0">That should be your main focus.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because if you can binge on good copywriting&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">You can recognize the obvious patterns.</p>
    <p class="c0">Like when I binged too much of &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; and ruined the show for myself.</p>
    <p class="c0">After that, you&rsquo;ll know everything you need to write your own amazing copy with ease.</p>
    
    
    <h1 class="c6">Section 1: The Headline</h1>
    <p class="c0">A crazy amount of the information must be conveyed very early in the copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Unfortunately, most readers won&rsquo;t read much further than the headline&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">So you&rsquo;ve got to cram a lot of stuff into your copy right away.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ve probably heard this before, but if you haven&rsquo;t:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The purpose of a headline is to grab attention.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s a VERY simplistic way to put it and there is A LOT to unpack from that line.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; way to put it, and this section will uncover the underlying assumptions that often go undiscussed.</p>
    <p class="c0">First, we should discuss the structure of a headline.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">The Structure of the Headline Complex</h2>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s the headline for The Hottest IPO In History</p>
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image22.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0"><strong><u>The line at the top:</u></strong> “WARNING: Limited Spots Available” is referred to as the “eyebrow.” </p>
    <p class="c0"><strong><u>The headline is</u></strong> &ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">The stuff below the headline, the &ldquo;99.9%...goes public!&rdquo; is referred to as<strong><u> &ldquo;deck copy.</u></strong>&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">You could call the testimonial beneath &ldquo;deck copy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You could call it &ldquo;<strong><u>the testimonial box.</u></strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s where my structure expertise ends because it doesn&rsquo;t much matter what you label it.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The 4 U&rsquo;s</h2>
    <p class="c0">The quickest method for translating a headline is to identify four elements commonly labeled as &ldquo;The Four U&rsquo;s.&rdquo; (lots of fours in this guide, huh?)</p>
    <p class="c0">A google search told me that the 4 U&rsquo;s were originally developed by legendary entrepreneur and copywriter, Mark Ford.</p>
    <p class="c0">Ford co-founded American Writers and Artists, Inc&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And The Palm Beach Letter, the flagship investment advisory for Palm Beach Research Group.</p>
    <p class="c0">I haven&rsquo;t done any further research on how the 4 U&rsquo;s were developed or what they specifically meant to Mark Ford.</p>
    <p class="c0">That being said: Ford may have slightly different definitions than I&rsquo;m sharing here, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be material differences.</p>
    <p class="c0">So in this section, I&rsquo;m going to be explaining what the four U&rsquo;s mean to me, personally.</p>
    <p class="c0">The four U&rsquo;s are:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_5-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Urgent</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Unique</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Useful</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Ultra-Specific</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">All four do not have to be present for a headline to work.</p>
    <p class="c0">But if 2 or more are missing, the headline will probably not hold attention.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Urgent</h2>
    <p class="c0">Urgency is easy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just convey that there is a limited time to read this piece of copy and get in on this opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you see a date in the headline, its sole purpose is to convey urgency.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">“Take action by December 21” </p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">“Sale ends this Friday”</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Usually, when one conveys the Big emotion in the headline, it also creates urgency through FOMO.</p>
    <p class="c0">FOMO is like a cousin of urgency.</p>
    <p class="c0">Consider the Hottest IPO headline again:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image22.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">There is nothing specifically urgent about it&hellip; but there is a hint of urgency within the FOMO it generates.</p>
    <p class="c0">The &ldquo;deck copy&rdquo; beneath the headline teases more urgency with the &ldquo;BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s another subtle example from Money Map:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image24.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Notice how the copywriter says it&rsquo;s ABOUT to go public.</p>
    <p class="c0">Also you&rsquo;ll see the Big emotion and FOMO clearly at play here.</p>
    <p class="c0">Many times, copywriters just go right for the throat with urgency.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example from a headline with clear urgency&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I wrote this during the cryptocurrency boom:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image23.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Urgency is the simplest U, and one of the U&rsquo;s that could be discarded from the headline, so long as the other 3 are present.</p>
    <p class="c0">One of my favorite promos was Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Money Zone&rdquo; promo.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">That was a very successful promo, and there was zero urgency in the headline.</p>
    <p class="c0">Take a look&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image26.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Ultra-Specific</h2>
    <p class="c0">The next U is Ultra-specific.</p>
    <p class="c0">Find some way to make the opportunity &ldquo;weirdly&rdquo; specific.</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t tell someone they can make $10,000.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.lnxbz9">Tell them they can make $10,251 (odd numbers supposedly work best).</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t tell them they&rsquo;ll look 10 years younger&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Tell them they&rsquo;ll look 12 and a half years younger.</p>
    <p class="c0">Starting to get it?</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t tell them their strength will improve 100%...</p>
    <p class="c0">Tell them it will improve 251%.</p>
    <p class="c0">Alright.</p>
    <p class="c0">So that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
    <p class="c0">Another way to plug in some ultra-specificity is with speed.</p>
    <p class="c0">Selling a karate course?</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;A 3-second karate move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The specific numbers imply that the headline&rsquo;s claim has been tested and proven before.</p>
    <p class="c0">The line: &ldquo;A 3-second move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo; implies that this move has in fact worked in 3 seconds before&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">AND the move worked for someone who weighed 134 pounds less than their opponent.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">The reason ultra-specificity is so important is it plants depth into the claim.</p>
    <p class="c0">In short, it makes the headline seem REAL.</p>
    <p class="c0">It increases believability.</p>
    <p class="c0">At least enough that the reader may investigate further.</p>
    <p class="c0">In The Hottest IPO example above, the promise was &ldquo;can turn the average retirement into $588,000 or more&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">In the 70-Cent Crypto example above: &ldquo;turn a small sum into $2.7 million.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Go as specific as legally possible, and don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, the ultra-specific claim should be based on an example that you will demonstrate in your lead or body copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Consider the lead copy of 70 Cent Crypto:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image25.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">See how right away we explain where the $2.7 million claim came from?</p>
    <p class="c0">Ultra-specific is another one of the U&rsquo;s that can be discarded, so long as the other 3 U&rsquo;s are still present.</p>
    <p class="c0">Money Map&rsquo;s Money Zone promo claimed you could make &ldquo;up to $11,000 a week&rdquo; and it worked very well.</p>
    <p class="c0">I would say that line is sorta specific.</p>
    <p class="c0">Not &ldquo;ultra.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And that promo&rsquo;s headline didn&rsquo;t even have ANY urgency!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Unique</h2>
    <p class="c0">Unique is non-negotiable.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because unique is a synonym for New and novel.</p>
    <p class="c0">We know from The Big 4 Emotions that New is the foundation of strong copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">If your headline offers up something the reader has seen before, they will not waste their precious time reading it.</p>
    <p class="c0">Think about the health niche, where diets come and go.</p>
    <p class="c0">Is anybody still trying to sell you on the Atkins diet?</p>
    <p class="c0">A while back it was EVERYWHERE.</p>
    <p class="c0">But after a while it wasn&rsquo;t New.</p>
    <p class="c0">And it wasn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;magic bullet solution&rdquo; many people thought it would be.</p>
    <p class="c0">And thus, they began their search for the next &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; that would make them a healthier, fitter, sexier person&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">overnight.</p>
    <p class="c0">The South Beach Diet was first called the &ldquo;Modified Carbohydrate Diet.&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t a sexy sell&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">After rebranding the diet as something New (The South Beach Diet), it took off.</p>
    <p class="c0">In 2018, the ketogenic diet (keto) was the hot new diet.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I bet in 2019 keto will all but disappear, except for within the circles of intense keto advocates.</p>
    <p class="c0">New diets will continue to emerge and dominate simply because the market demands it.</p>
    <p class="c0">People who struggle to consistently diet and exercise will always be looking for the easier solution.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s one of the things that makes &ldquo;unique&rdquo; so captivating.</p>
    <p class="c0">Take a look at this Money Map headline for their Night Trader Product&hellip;</p>
    
    <img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image28.jpg" title="">
    
    <p class="c0">The copywriter infers &ldquo;this is different&rdquo; by starting with &ldquo;99.99% of American Investors Trade During the Day&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then moving into&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;While other people toss and turn&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">This conveys the subtext that he is doing something New&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">He&rsquo;s the Only person doing it (or at least in the 00.01%)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And that makes it Unique!</p>
    <p class="c0">If the reader has been struggling for success in the stock market, this headline offers up some secret knowledge about a New, unique method that they&rsquo;ve never heard of&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This headline offers hope because it is unique!</p>
    <p class="c0">Another example of unique&rsquo;s power can be found by referring back to the Money Zone headline from the previous section&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I would argue that the uniqueness of the Money Zone headline&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Where they claim America&rsquo;s #1 stock analyst is &ldquo;DONE with stocks!&rdquo;...</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.1ksv4uv">Is where the power of the headline came from.</p>
    <p class="c0">How often does the #1 person at anything announce they are completely giving that thing up? Something New and better must have been uncovered!</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter understood that nothing is more important than being New and Novel&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">When you plant something unique in your headline, you are conveying the New emotion in the subtext.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">To convey something unique, just pull one item from your product or offer, and emphasize it.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Money Zone product doesn&rsquo;t trade traditional stocks.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Night Trader product trades at night.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.44sinio">It&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>
    <p class="c0">Your product probably has more than one unique element to it.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance, here is a second headline for The Hottest IPO that I wrote&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image27.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">This headline is selling the same product as The Hottest IPO, but with a completely fresh and unique idea.</p>
    <p class="c0">The main selling point of The Hottest IPO and The $15 Trillion Gadget is that self-driving cars are going to be very disruptive.</p>
    <p class="c0">So I was able to tie that idea of self-driving cars to an IPO and also tie it to the physical parts that make self-driving cars work.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is useful for refreshing fatiguing copy, but that&rsquo;s a little advanced for this section.</p>
    <p class="c0">The point is&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">finding something unique in your offer or product just requires a little critical thinking.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Just Highlight Something</h3>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t spin your wheels trying to make your idea totally &ldquo;revolutionary.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c27">Finding something unique isn&rsquo;t that hard.</p>
    <p class="c27">In fact, that is probably the hardest part&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c27">There is no &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; for you.</p>
    <p class="c0">It probably won&rsquo;t &ldquo;jump out at you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because your unique element could be any insignificant thing.</p>
    <p class="c0">There just needs to be a unique element in your headline that the reader has never, ever seen before.</p>
    <p class="c0">An easy &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to think about this: &ldquo;The first BLANK to ever&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The first skin cream to ever use volcanic ash.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The first options trading system to ever exclusively trade 25 cent options&hellip;&rdquo; This conveys New, and New conveys unique.</p>
    <p class="c0">I want to push you away from copying down this line and using it.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because I don&rsquo;t necessarily want you to directly state this line in your headline.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, I almost deleted this &ldquo;hack&rdquo; example from this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">For fear you would simply use it as a bland template.</p>
    <p class="c0">This &ldquo;hack&rdquo; is supposed to get your mind thinking about the subtext you need to convey: NEW.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember, I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m offering tools to help you translate the copywriting language so YOU can speak it fluently.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s look over a quick example to show what I mean&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The 70 Cent Crypto headline is a great example.</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image31.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">When we wrote this promo, cryptocurrencies were hot.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everybody was piling into crypto.</p>
    <p class="c0">So how could I make headline about cryptocurrencies feel unique? I could just pick one element about the crypto and highlight it.</p>
    <p class="c0">All I had to do was draw attention to how cheap the crypto was and voila.</p>
    <p class="c0">I wouldn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;The first crypto ever to be 70 cents and could make you rich.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why templates are bad news.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you can speak the copywriting language, your headline will use words that are as natural to you as how you describe your favorite restaurant.</p>
    <p class="c0">Think about this&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">If you wanted to convince me to go to your favorite restaurant, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t say:</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.2jxsxqh">&ldquo;How do I get Kyle interested in this restaurant? Ummm&hellip; It&rsquo;s the first restaurant ever to&hellip; Uhhh&hellip; the first restaurant ever to give me two loaves of bread before dinner?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">If you try to fit your writing into a tight template, it will stifle your abilities...</p>
    <p class="c0">It will kill your ability to create something New...</p>
    <p class="c0">And that will kill your success.</p>
    <p class="c0">We are not putting together a piece of furniture when we build a headline&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">We are speaking a language of subtext and emotion.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.z337ya">Always, always, always, start your process THERE.</p>
    <p class="c0">Think to yourself &ldquo;I know the subtext I must communicate, what words might do that best?&rdquo; And make sure your headline has some unique element or idea in it.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">Useful</h2>
    <p class="c0">The reader will not care to read your copy if they do not feel they will draw something useful from it.</p>
    <p class="c0">This means you will already need to know what your audience finds &ldquo;useful...&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">This will require some research.</p>
    <p class="c0">To write something truly useful, you&rsquo;ll want to know:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_21-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Who your ideal prospect is</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">What topics they are curious about today</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">What promises or benefits would compel them to continue reading on</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">One approach is to directly offer a benefit:</p>
    <p class="c27">&ldquo;Make money&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c27">&ldquo;Look younger&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c27">Etc&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or you can offer information on a specific topic that is top of mind, that they are interested in&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Take a look at this headline by Palm Beach Research Group for their product, The Palm Beach Letter.</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image29.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">This headline refers to President Trump&rsquo;s tax reform, which was highly covered by the media.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can see the copywriter took something top of mind and made it useful.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">When you know what is top of mind for your reader, you can write something that strikes a specific chord of intrigue.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Intrigue Alone is NOT Useful &ndash; What&rsquo;s In It For Me? (WIIFM)</h3>
    <p class="c0">I have seen experienced copywriters make this mistake before...</p>
    <p class="c0">They&rsquo;ll show me a headline and say, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I search and search but then I&rsquo;m forced to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then they&rsquo;ll say something like, &ldquo;Well, this is a topic they should really be interested in reading more about...&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then they frown and realize that intrigue alone is not going to cut it.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes even great writers can get caught up in the excitement of their idea.</p>
    <p class="c0">But great copywriters also know that intrigue alone is not enough to pull a reader into your sales letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once this error is pointed out to them, experienced copywriters immediately go back to the drawing board without argument.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember, everyone wants to know &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In It For Me?&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;WIIFM is everyone&rsquo;s favorite radio station.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Your headline must be useful to the reader.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">Going back to the Palm Beach Letter headline: &ldquo;We Snuck Through!&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">That is a cool, intriguing headline&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Snuck through where???</p>
    <p class="c0">The writer teases the usefulness via &ldquo;income tricks&rdquo; while introducing a topic that is top of mind: tax reform.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;18 Little&mdash;Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">And finally, really making it REALLY useful for the reader, the writer drops the line:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;A new FREE BOOK reveals how you could collect up to $6,842 per month thanks to these 100% legal ideas&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And if you&rsquo;re really paying attention, you should be able to see how we are incorporating different elements we&rsquo;ve learned in the previous sections.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">It All Adds Up</h3>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s take a moment to go through this&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The words &ldquo;little known&rdquo; and &ldquo;loopholes&rdquo; imply you can &ldquo;Only&rdquo; get this knowledge from me.</p>
    <p class="c0">Otherwise everyone would know.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Only is New&rsquo;s powerful alter ego.</p>
    <p class="c0">The link to Trump&rsquo;s tax reforms makes the headline Safe...</p>
    <p class="c0">By tying the headline to the government and the law, the opportunity has the highest level of credibility.</p>
    <p class="c0">Making $6,842 per month is ultra-specific, useful, &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Predictable because per month implies the income will repeat on a monthly basis.</p>
    <p class="c0">A FREE BOOK is cheap enough for Anyone to Easily afford.</p>
    <p class="c0">And &ldquo;100% legal ideas&rdquo; implies that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything out of the ordinary, shady, or difficult.</p>
    <p class="c0">See how many boxes have been checked...</p>
    <p class="c0">All of it neatly wrapped into the headline.</p>
    <h2 class="c6">Wrapping Up The Headline</h2>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps without this guide, you might have seen a headline like, &ldquo;&ldquo;WE SNUCK THROUGH!&rdquo; 18 Little&mdash; Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And thought: &ldquo;benefit driven headline.&rdquo; But now, in this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Right in front of you&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You have all the tools you need to pick apart headlines like this and see what they really communicate.</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriting language is a direct link to a reader&rsquo;s emotional triggers.</p>
    <p class="c0">The language is communicated purely through the subtext.</p>
    <p class="c0">All you have to do is keep your focus on The Big 4.</p>
    <p class="c0">Already you&rsquo;ve seen how a copywriter can communicate New, Easy, Safe and Big in a wild variety of ways.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ve seen that the words do not matter&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Only what the words imply.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I try very hard to never tell you what to write&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because I want YOU to develop the your copywriting fluency to a point that you intuitively know you communicate something is Easy simply by calling it &ldquo;100% legal.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Going forward, you&rsquo;ll know with a quick glance whether a headline is doing its job well or not.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll be able to binge hundreds of headlines this way&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Uncovering the subliminal patterns that make the best ones work so well.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now that you know what elements must be communicated, via the language of copywriting, you can quickly form your own headlines.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I didn&rsquo;t tell you a single thing to write&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because it isn&rsquo;t what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you know you must communicate urgency&hellip; the words will just come naturally.</p>
    <p class="c0">And it will be more and more natural as you binge more and more copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll recognize the common patterns of how other writers convey urgency.</p>
    <p class="c0">It will be the same when you know you must communicate uniqueness: the words will come naturally.</p>
    <p class="c0">You know you must communicate ultra-specificity&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The words will come naturally.</p>
    <p class="c0">You know you must communicate usefulness&hellip; and guess what?</p>
    <p class="c0">The words will come as naturally as saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful day outside&rdquo; in plain English.</p>
    <p class="c0">And very soon, as you make your way through the rest of this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be able to go from headline to P.S. writing your own piece of copy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Powerfully communicating in the language of copywriting with ease.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see that virtually every line in a successful piece of copy serves a purpose.</p>
    <p class="c0">And once you know how to translate the subtext from the words&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">For the first time ever, you&rsquo;ll speak the same language as the best copywriters in the world.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be unstoppable.</p>
    
    <h1 class="c6">Section 2: The Lead</h1>
    
    <p class="c0">The lead is what immediately follows the headline and in terms of the Big 4, the lead is the generally the densest area of a piece of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">It would not be crazy to think you could spend 30 minutes picking apart the first 500 words of a piece of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">I have a few ways to sum up a lead.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Lead Is Like The Abstract To A Scholarly Journal Article.</h2>
    <p class="c0">If you&rsquo;ve ever looked up a scholarly journal article, they always have an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; at the top.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or you might see it on the preview page where they ask you to pay for the full article.</p>
    <p class="c0">In an abstract, the researcher has to communicate pretty much all the major details of the study.</p>
    <p class="c0">That could be the major details about the sample, the methods, and the results.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that serves as a high-level summary of the what you can expect if you purchase the research article&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">If a reader wants the finer details, they buy or read the whole article.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s basically what a copywriter is tasked to do when writing a lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here are the FIVE major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_20-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Capture attention (Can be done in headline)</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Expand upon the headline</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Establish credibility</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Make a big promise</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Open a loop (bribe)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">But before we get into the step-by-steps, we have to cover some ground rules.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Lead Should Contain The Most Compelling Claims and Info That Will Be Covered In The Copy</h2>
    <p class="c0">A copywriter has to cram some of the &ldquo;major&rdquo; information about what will be covered in the body copy into the first couple pages&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or approximately 500-ish words.</p>
    <p class="c0">Keep in mind, leads can vary in length.</p>
    <p class="c0">In long form sales letters, I&rsquo;ve seen leads range anywhere from 2-7 pages.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Basically, you&rsquo;ll want to tease your most compelling claim or claims and produce your general sales message in the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you haven&rsquo;t started proving your claims by page 7, you probably need to scale the lead back.</p>
    <p class="c0">At a minimum:</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">The Lead Should Introduce the Fundamental Claim or Idea That Will Be Covered or Proven in the Body Copy.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">That does NOT mean you must reveal the offer or product in the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">Not even a little bit.</p>
    <p class="c0">In many sales letters, the offer or product is hidden until the very last few pages.</p>
    <p class="c0">Usually in a long form sales letter, the lead&rsquo;s purpose is to build hype about an opportunity&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or really illustrate the terrible problem that needs to be solved.</p>
    <p class="c0">It does that by acutely focusing on the Big 4, right up until the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; is introduced.</p>
    <p class="c0">Often, once the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; behind the letter (the guy selling something) is introduced, the lead is over.</p>
    <p class="c0">And essentially, by the time you reach the end of the lead, all the major information that would make your prospect want to buy should have already been conveyed.</p>
    <p class="c0">The rest of the letter, called the body copy, is just &ldquo;proving the point.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Lead Offers ONE Big Idea or Promise Which Can Be Summed Up In A Single Sentence</h2>
    <p class="c0">In my experience, writing a lead is an &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; process.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is, I won&rsquo;t actually know everything that will be in the lead until the promo is about fully written.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes when I&rsquo;m writing the body copy I&rsquo;ll discover some neat hook, a weird angle, or a new piece of information I could go back and inject into the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s been the same while writing this guide.</p>
    <p class="c0">I started writing this guide knowing the &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; I wanted to take the text.</p>
    <p class="c0">I had ONE idea.</p>
    <p class="c0">Which I could sum up in a single sentence&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Copywriting is a language, communicated purely through subtext.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I started my introduction by writing some of the things I THOUGHT I would cover&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But as I&rsquo;ve been writing the book, it has taken a life and direction of its own.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I keep having to go back and change my introduction to tease what is really be covered.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s the same thing with any lead, in my experience.</p>
    <p class="c0">But you should still only have one idea.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Headline, Lead, and Body Copy Share a &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo;</h2>
    <p class="c0">Before you write a word of copy, summarize your idea in one sentence.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of your letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">It is the lifeforce that compelled you to write your piece of copy in the first place.</p>
    <p class="c0">The reason for this is you NEED a single coherent direction.</p>
    <p class="c0">Start with this question: what is the one major benefit or payoff that everything in your copy will tie to? I&rsquo;ve heard this called &ldquo;The Golden Thread.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And it&rsquo;s also been referred to as &ldquo;The Rule of One.&rdquo; I call it the &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Ideally, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what the Soul of your copy is before you start writing.</p>
    <p class="c0">But as I mentioned earlier, for me writing the lead is an &ldquo;ongoing process.&rdquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I like the term &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">It gives your idea permission to exist like a living thing&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Something that grows and evolves over time.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes your Soul will be crystal clear&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes you will have to hash out a couple attempts to focus or find your Soul.</p>
    <p class="c0">But you should always have some sense for what your Soul is about.</p>
    <p class="c0">New information should just sharpen the Soul and make it clearer.</p>
    <p class="c0">The point is, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if your Soul starts a little vague when you write the first version of your lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">But at the end of writing your copy, EVERYTHING should be tied to ONE idea that you can sum up in a single sentence.</p>
    <p class="c0">For example, I wrote a promo called Trump Bonus Checks with another copywriter, Rob Braddock.</p>
    <p class="c0">We had ONE sentence to guide all of our writing.</p>
    <p class="c0">That sentence was EXACTLY THIS: </p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><strong class="c19"><u>&ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo;</u></strong></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><u class="c24"></u></p>
    <p class="c0">That was the Soul of our promo.</p>
    <p class="c0">If anything we wrote deviated from that message in any way, it was promptly deleted.</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, knowing all these things I&rsquo;ve explained about the lead&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Again, here are the FOUR major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_19-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Capture attention</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Expand upon the headline</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Establish credibility</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Make a Big Promise</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Open a loop</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Lead Should Capture Attention</h2>
    <p class="c0">To capture attention, some copywriters begin their lead with what is called a pattern interrupt.</p>
    <p class="c0">&nbsp;A super easy way to quickly capture a reader&rsquo;s attention is to just show them something&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Preferably something they haven&rsquo;t seen before in another ad.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a couple examples from promos I have worked on.</p>
    <p class="c0">Notice how all the lead text starts in a similar fashion&hellip;</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image30.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image32.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image33.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image34.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">Coming up with a pattern interrupt isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just try to get the reader to focus attention on you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Be aware of what your competitors are putting in front of your reader as pattern interrupts.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">You do not want to present your reader with something they have seen before.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now you know you can grab their attention in the lead with a pattern interrupt&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or, if you think your headline complex by itself was a strong enough pattern interrupt, you can build their intrigue by expanding upon your headline.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Lead Should Expand Upon the Headline</h2>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll want the lead to flow right out of your headline and offer some additional relevant information about your headline.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is sometimes called a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Payoffs</p>
    <p class="c0">Your headline should generate sufficient curiosity for the reader to want to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
    <p class="c0">The next line out of the headline should give them just a little bit more detail without giving away anything too particular.</p>
    <p class="c0">Some folks refer to this as a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I can demonstrate the payoff concept in the first couple lines of a successful marketing email I wrote for The $15 Trillion Gadget.</p>

    <p class="c0">They are just something I use to capture and hold the reader&rsquo;s attention while I shift gears to the real opportunity I want to talk about&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The technology inside the gadget, and its potential money rewards.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s when I drop the line:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a breakthrough $15 trillion tech revolution&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s the big promise I really want them to read.</p>
    <p class="c0">It was the same strategy with the pattern interrupt examples above.</p>
    <p class="c0">I captured the reader&rsquo;s attention just long enough to shift to my big promise&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Which is usually something like: &ldquo;You can get rich from this.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You want to get to your one big promise as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">As. Soon. As. &nbsp;Possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s another example of expanding upon the headline in promo I wrote for Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass&hellip;</p>

    <h2 class="c6">The Lead Should Offer Credibility</h2>
    <p class="c0">Very early in your lead, the copy should offer credibility that explains why your reader should believe you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Thinking about it logically &ndash; You should have made a big promise in your headline&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Your promise is weird and specific enough to capture and hold attention&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It offers something the reader wants&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And chances are, the reader is so cynical and skeptical they are on the edge of shouting &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; the first chance they get.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, they can&rsquo;t wait to call bullshit on a &ldquo;scammy marketer&rdquo; like you.</p>
    <p class="c0">They live for it!</p>
    <p class="c0">This is the time to inject some cred that proves either:</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">You are a credible authority, who should be listened to, or&hellip;</li>
        <li class="c26">Your claims are supported by credible authorities </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c38">You do not need to make a big show of credibility in the lead.</p>
    <p class="c38">Just a single line will do for now.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because as you&rsquo;ll see when we explore the body copy, there is a more appropriate time to lay the credibility on thick.</p>
    <p class="c0">If we refer back to that short email I wrote, you&rsquo;ll see I inject some credibility after my big promise by quoting an authority:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, &ldquo;Once the massive market disruption begins&hellip; we expect significant turmoil.&rdquo; &ldquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">We don&rsquo;t know how or why the turmoil will come&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But a guy with a fancy title said he expects it&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">That communicates the event is basically inevitable!</p>
    <p class="c0">(Communicating something is probable/inevitable communicates our the Big 4 Emotion of Safe/Predictable&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Are you starting to see how these lessons are building on each other more and more?)</p>
    <p class="c0">I then have to quickly move to a call to action after that credibility line because it was a short email, not a sales letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">This email has proved consistently that by the time a reader reaches the end of it&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">That about 11% of people are sufficiently intrigued and convinced that whatever this thing is, it&rsquo;s real and interesting enough to them to click the link and learn more...</p>
    <p class="c0">And these readers get a lot of marketing emails every single day.</p>
    <p class="c0">Also consider this: Clicking a link is an action the reader has to take.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s some form of investment or micro-commitment, which is a decent feat in persuasion.</p>
    <p class="c0">For a copywriter starting their lead, their job is simpler.</p>
    <p class="c0">They just need make sure the reader takes NO action besides reading the next line.</p>
    <p class="c0">Another Example:</p>
    <p class="c0">We can also look back to the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass letter for an example of credibility.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll notice that the opening line IS, in fact, credibility.</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;Dear Reader,</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">I&rsquo;m Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time.&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p class="c0">I had utilized a significant amount of deck copy to expand my headline&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And dropping credibility in the first line was easy and natural.</p>
    <p class="c0">There is no hard and fast &ldquo;specific&rdquo; timing with the four things you must do in the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m simply highlighting patterns of subtext that is usually communicated by the best copywriters.</p>
    <p class="c0">I have personally followed these patterns to great success.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I know you can too.</p>
    <p class="c0">So we have captured attention&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Expanded upon the headline&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And inserted some credibility&hellip; what now?</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Lead Should Offer The Big Promise</h2>
    <p class="c0">As I stated earlier, you want to get to your big promise as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">There are no specific words you must use.</p>
    <p class="c0">You should write whatever comes most naturally.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s possible your Big Promise will change slightly from the time you start your writing until you finish.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
    <p class="c0">When constructing your big promise, use the Big 4 Emotions as a guide:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_18-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">New / Only</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Easy / Anybody</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Safe / Predictable</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Big / Fast</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Some products lend themselves to certain emotions more than others.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance, if a writer wants to sell a product based around a &ldquo;system&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">It could be a system to help lonely, single people go on more dates&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">A system for hopeless couch potatoes to lose 20 pounds&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">A system for broke people to generate passive income&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It could be anything about a step by step system / push-button solution / done-for-you product&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The writer may want to lean more heavily on introducing and proving claims about how Fast the system pays out benefits and how Anybody can use it.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Big Promise should reflect that as well.</p>
    <p class="c0">If a copywriter is writing about a prediction&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">A trend that the copywriter wants readers to buy into early&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">If the writer is trying to convince a person that something is on its way and the reader needs to act fast&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Then the copywriter will lean on emotions of New and Big to rile up that fear of missing out.</p>
    <p class="c0">Throughout the copy, the copywriter will want to hit on as many of the Big 4 Emotions as possible&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But a writer can lean much more heavily on the two or three that naturally favor their offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">Which ones the writer chooses as the most important to their message will make up the remainder of their lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">But if you can, jam as many of the Big 4 Emotions as you can early into your lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s revisit the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass lead&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image36.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s my Big Promise&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><strong class="c13">&ldquo;All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even</strong></p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><strong class="c13">$4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p>
    <p class="c0">My Big Promise actually states the words &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because the promise is for passive income.</p>
    <p class="c0">Someone who wants passive income wants money to come on auto-pilot.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">They don&rsquo;t want to have to tinker with anything.</p>
    <p class="c0">They don&rsquo;t want to worry about the fluctuations of the stock market.</p>
    <p class="c0">They just want the money to come and come on time.</p>
    <p class="c0">Set it and forget it.</p>
    <p class="c0">So I stress that this is safe and predictable in my promise.</p>
    <p class="c0">Also, the phrase &ldquo;All it takes&hellip;&rdquo; indicates there is an abundance of &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; in this offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">And all you need to do is take advantage of a couple of the 49 secrets. Easy.</p>
    <p class="c0">At the same time I&rsquo;m promising Big income numbers, up in the thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p class="c0">And the opportunity is totally New because this information has never been in any of the past books that Robert has written!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Lead Should Open A Loop</h2>
    <p class="c0">At this point in the lead, the writer has brought up their big promise and presented their most compelling claims&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Now they need to create an &ldquo;open loop.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c27">An open loop is just a &ldquo;tease&rdquo; for information that will be revealed later in the letter.</p>
    <p class="c27">This is also referred to as a &ldquo;bribe.&rdquo; (I got the term &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; from Clayton Makepeace).</p>
    <p class="c27">It&rsquo;s a bribe you offer them in exchange for them to continue reading.</p>
    <p class="c0">Luckily, opening a loop is pretty simple to execute, and can be written like:</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented">&ldquo;In just a second, I will show you exactly how &lsquo;the claims I just said&rsquo; are totally true.&rdquo; This is a simple open loop&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see variants as you binge copy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Another common example:</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented">&ldquo;If you stick with me, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt how you can &lsquo;receive the benefits I promised.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Just look over a couple pieces of copy and next thing you&rsquo;ll know, you&rsquo;ll be able to rattle off 10 different lines to open a loop.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll find methods that are far more subtle than asking the reader to stick around.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, in just a second I&rsquo;ll show you a masterfully written open loop right out of an actual sales letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">But first&hellip;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Putting A Lead Together</h2>
    <p class="c0">We see the lead usually contains five basic elements</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_18-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Capture attention</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Expand upon the headline</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Establish credibility</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Make a Big Promise</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Open a loop (bribe)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">When you look at leads the way I have described, the job becomes fairly straightforward.</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter should already understand the Soul of his project.</p>
    <p class="c0">He has summed up his idea in a single sentence.</p>
    <p class="c0">i.e. for Trump Bonus Checks we used &ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo; Then the copywriter is tasked with proving that idea.</p>
    <p class="c0">The writers task is to find information that proves the claims&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Then communicate them through the Big 4 Emotions.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you see that, and truly grasp it in your bones&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Writing copy just becomes a system of answering simple questions.</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Start with:</strong></p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">The soul of my promo summed up in a single sentence is&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Then:</strong></p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;How do I prove this is Big? &nbsp;What can I compare it to that was Big already?&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented">&ldquo;How can I demonstrate to the reader how Easy and Fast this is?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The best writers in the world know this&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though it&rsquo;s quite possible they don&rsquo;t consciously know that they are doing it this way.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because they think they just &ldquo;get it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">They speak the language of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just like when you talk to your friends&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You don&rsquo;t consciously realize when you are conjugating verbs or using adjectives to modify nouns.</p>
    <p class="c0">You just do it.</p>
    <p class="c0">After years of practice, the master copywriters eventually come to speak the language of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">But it won&rsquo;t take you years of practice.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Starting today (or whenever you finish this guide)&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You can look at a line of copy and immediately translate what the writer was trying to accomplish.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I mean ANY old random line of copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll know EXACTLY why it was written&hellip; even if it is completely out of context!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Any Single Line of Copy</h2>
    <p class="c0">As proof of the practical use of this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;ve grabbed a single, random line of copy from the lead of a sales letter in my swipe file.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you&rsquo;ve paid attention to every word up to this point in the guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You know everything you must know to translate its true meaning.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s the one line:</p>
    <p class="c6 c30 c-indented">&ldquo;Plus multiple triple-digit wins of up to 542% in the coming months...&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">See if you can use what you&rsquo;ve learned to translate this single, out of context line.</p>
    <p class="c0">What do you think the writer was trying to communicate? </p>
    <p class="c0">You know this line is in the lead&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And you have the Big 4 Emotions framework to go by&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Take a shot at it on your own, then I&rsquo;ll go into it with you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Does the translation jump out at you yet?</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s see if we can figure out what this single line communicates&hellip; REALLY.</p>
    <p class="c0">Since this is in the lead, it looks like the copywriter is setting up a promise or claim he will have to prove later in the body copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And what are they trying to communicate with this claim?</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_17-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">&ldquo;Multiple&rdquo; = more than one chance to profit = <strong class="c13">Safe</strong>.</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">&ldquo;Triple digit wins&rdquo; = <strong class="c13">Big</strong>&nbsp;<strong class="c13">wins</strong>.</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">&ldquo;542%&rdquo; is specific enough to imply some intense calculation has been run to produce this number = Safe.</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">That 542% number is a pretty nice return = <strong class="c13">Big</strong>.</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">&ldquo;Coming months&rdquo; = <strong class="c13">Predictable</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">When you translate each word using just the Big 4 Emotions as your decoder&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You can see this line was designed to communicate that the opportunity is both Big and Safe.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is one line of copy from a 37-page promo.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Now imagine you binged and translated copy like this for multiple sales letters&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">You dug into each line to find what it was truly communicating&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It would not take you long at all before you&rsquo;d see&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">These sales-letter things are all pretty similar.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Finally, you&rsquo;ll speak the language of copywriting with ease.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Quick Exercise: Translate The Copy That Surrounds That Single Line</h2>
    <p class="c0">Below I&rsquo;ll post the rest of the copy that surrounds that single line we just translated.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s from a sales letter by Money Map Press.</p>
    <p class="c0">The headline is:</p>
    <p class="c0">Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker I&rsquo;ve dissected this promo on my YouTube.</p>
    <p class="c0">Since you&rsquo;re probably reading this as a digital copy, I&rsquo;ll give you the URL to that YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/Fv7zwDItHlk</p>
    <p class="c0">Copy and paste that link and you can see me dissect the entire sales letter for free.</p>

    <p class="c0">I don&rsquo;t want to make sales pitches inside a book you paid money for, but I thought you might be interested in these free resources.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s some of the copywriting that surrounds that single line we just translated:</p>

                    <p class="c0">You could haul in the kinds of profits that only come around once in a century.</p>

        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="c0">This is the end of the lead for that promo.</p>
    <p class="c0">The lead is 382 words long.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then the writer transitions into the body copy next by introducing the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; in what I call &ldquo;the credibility section.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Earlier I said I would show you an open loop.</p>
    <p class="c0">Do you see it?</p>
    <p class="c0">The open loop was:</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">&ldquo;If you play it the way I&rsquo;m going to show you&hellip;&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter is SAYING you can make a bunch of money&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">But what he is really communicating &nbsp;is:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;I will reveal this method to you&hellip; just keep reading&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Then the copy goes on to communicate:</p>

    <p class="c0">Maybe you caught it, but I just opened another loop above:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Earlier I said I would show you an open loop&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I opened a new loop RIGHT before closing my first loop by saying &ldquo;but before we dive into&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s the easiest way to do set up loops.</p>
    <p class="c0">After finishing this guide and binging a little bit of copy, you&rsquo;ll be able to open loops easily and automatically.</p>
    
    <h1 class="c6">Section 3: The Body Copy</h1>
    <p class="c6 c3">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Believe it or not, things start to get a lot more streamlined in the body copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">The point of the body copy is <mark class="c19 c52"><strong>for the copywriter to prove their claims from the lead and <u>then any subsequent objections that may come up.</u></strong></mark></p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how I like to think about the body copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Imagine that you have totally made your pitch in the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">You laid out your opportunity, the exciting promise and maybe some claims about why they should buy today.</p>
    <p class="c0">Many people are excited and ready to buy.</p>
    <p class="c0">But there are a bunch of very analytical folks standing there with their arms folded and they say: </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but...&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That is an objection.</p>
    <p class="c0">That reader has some sort of hesitation about your lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">In the body copy, the copywriter&rsquo;s job is to anticipate every single &ldquo;Yeah, but&hellip;&rdquo; from their lead&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And then resolve it.</p>
    <p class="c0">And if that sounds like a lot, once again, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
    <p class="c0">There is a very simple template that you can follow to crush through each objection.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, while I usually recommend following emotions&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This is one of the few step-by-step templates I recommend you stick to.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll also be happy to know that there are some very common objections that are universal to almost every single sale on the planet.</p>
    <p class="c0">After you overcome them one or two times, it will be second nature for you going forward.</p>
    <p class="c0">The most complicated part is gathering the proof for overcoming objections.</p>
    <p class="c0">Again, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can usually grab everything you need from a quick google search.</p>
    <p class="c0">And once you overcome the most common objections, the bulk of your work in the body copy is done!</p>
    <p class="c0">&nbsp;So&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">In this section of the guide I&rsquo;ll offer:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_16-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c15">The simple template that master copywriters follow when they want to prove their point</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">The most common objections you must overcome</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">The most common types of proof you can use to overcome those objections</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s start with the proof template.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Body Template</h2>
    <p class="c0">The body copy will consist almost entirely of a copywriter repeating this single template over and over.</p>
    <p class="c0">Like most elements of the copywriting language, you would probably never even notice that a sales letter is just repeating this over and over unless you were specifically trained to translate copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Good thing you have this guide, huh?</p>
    <p class="c0">Again, I want to repeat that this is one of the few instances where I say it is a good idea for you to stick to the template almost always.</p>
    <p class="c0">Jumping straight into the template, here it is:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_16-0">
        <li class="c6 c15">Objection</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Claim</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Proof</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Benefit</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Feel free to drill this into your brain for a moment&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you grasp these four things, it will make the next two sections super easy to breeze through.</p>
    <p class="c0">Got these four burned in your brain forever?</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Addressing an Objection</h2>
    <p class="c0">An objection is anything in a customer&rsquo;s mind that may prevent them from buying.</p>
    <p class="c0">An objection doesn&rsquo;t have to be a literal &ldquo;no&rdquo; sort of objection to your claim or promise&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It could also be a critical piece of information that would cause the reader to refuse to buy unless they knew it.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">If a copywriter were to claim, &ldquo;You can make a ton of money with this system&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">A natural set of follow-up questions would be:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_16-0">
        <li class="c6 c15">&ldquo;Why am I just now hearing about this?&rdquo;</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">&ldquo;Do I need to have experience to do this?&rdquo;</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">&ldquo;What guarantees do I have?&rdquo;</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">&ldquo;How much money can I make?&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">None of these are outright literal &ldquo;objections,&rdquo; like someone shouting &ldquo;bullshit!&rdquo; or saying &ldquo;no way!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">But we address them as such.</p>
    <p class="c0">Also, please take a moment to note that I generated all four of these objections in an instant, simply by considering objections to my promise using the frame of The Big 4.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is, each objection corresponds to one of The Big 4&hellip;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_16-0">
        <li class="c6 c15">New</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Easy</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Safe</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Big</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">It took me mere seconds to generate those four objections, and I could definitely come up with more by considering the 4 alter egos.</p>
    <p class="c0">Well, you did pay money for this guide (I hope)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">So just for you I&rsquo;ll go the extra mile now&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The Alter Egos:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_16-0">
        <li class="c6 c15">New/Only</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Easy/Anybody</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Safe/Predictable</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">Big/Fast The objections:</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Why should I buy this from you?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">What if I don&rsquo;t have any money right now?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How do I know this will work?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How fast will I make money?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Again, by keeping the Big 4 Emotions top of mind&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I could generate every answer I needed to communicate without ANY effort.</p>
    <p class="c0">So now you have a set of objections you can anticipate a reasonable reader to consider.</p>
    <p class="c0">And all you have to do at this point is follow the body copy template and answer the objections.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c15"><strong class="c13">Objection</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c15"><strong class="c13">Claim</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c15"><strong class="c13">Proof</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c15"><strong class="c13">Benefit</strong>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c6"><u class="c24">Observe:</u></p>
    <p class="c0">First consider your objection: How much money can I make?</p>
    
    <p class="c0">A copywriter may blatantly address the objection in their copy this way:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;I bet by now you are probably wondering, &ldquo;how much money can I make?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or the copywriter can cut that step and just jump straight to the next step of the template: Claim.</p>
    <p class="c0">Before I dive into claims, I&rsquo;ll just rattle off some of the most common objections you might spot while translating copy&hellip;</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Why shouldn&rsquo;t I just use an alternative?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Why should I act now?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Who are you?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Why should I listen to you?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How did you figure this out?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How does it work?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Why are you telling me about this?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Is this going to be difficult?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">What do I need to get started?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Will this take a lot of time?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Is this risky?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How much will the results improve my life? / How big are the &ldquo;results?&rdquo; / How much money can I make, etc.</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How fast will it take to see results?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How much does it cost?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">What if it doesn&rsquo;t work?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="c6">Making a Claim</h2>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s very easy and subtler for a copywriter to anticipate an objection&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then start a new section of copy with they state a direct claim that answers the &ldquo;unspoken&rdquo; objection.</p>
    <p class="c0">The un-stated objection: How much money can I make? </p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter turns the answer (a claim) into a subhead:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You can make $10,000 in a week with this system.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, that&rsquo;s a cool.</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter has made their claim.</p>
    <p class="c0">And he didn&rsquo;t need to directly state the objection (How much money can I make?) in the copy at all.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s time for the proof.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Presenting Proof</h2>
    <p class="c0">Proof is any information that can help the copywriter substantiate their claim.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Generally, proof comes in threes.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s pretty important.</p>
    <p class="c0">The writing can feel a little &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; if the writer only offers one or two pieces of proof.</p>
    <p class="c0">More than three is great&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But generally, three is the magic number of proof points.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s go over the most common types of proof.</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Case studies</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Demonstrations</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Testimonials</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Quotes from authorities</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Charts and graphs</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Official documents</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Articles and headlines</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">So at this stage of the template the copywriter has claimed the reader can make $10,000 with their system.</p>
    <p class="c0">But they cannot find three pieces of proof showing $10,000 returns.</p>
    <p class="c0">The $10,000 mark is just too high.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
    <p class="c0">There&rsquo;s a simple trick for this.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d do.</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Proof #1:</strong></p>
    <p class="c6 c59">&ldquo;Look at what happened when my proprietary system said buy Stock ABC&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c6 c59">*show a chart of Stock ABC* You could have made $5,000!&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Proof #2:</strong></p>
    <p class="c6 c59">&ldquo;And then the system said buy Stock DEF&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c6 c59">*show a chart of Stock DEF* You could have made $7,500!&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Proof #3:</strong></p>
    <p class="c6 c56">&ldquo;Now I bet you&rsquo;re pretty convinced this is a great system.<strong class="c13">&nbsp;</strong>But wait until I show you what happened when the system said to buy stock GHI&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c6 c56">*show a chart of Stock GHI*</p>
    
    <p class="c0">You could have made a whopping $10,000!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter just proved you could make $10,000 with the system and provided three pieces of proof.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Show Don&rsquo;t Tell</h2>
    <p class="c0">When a copywriter is offering up their three or more pieces of proof, they would like &ldquo;show&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tell&rdquo; as often as possible.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can try to present number gains as visuals, like the charts in the above example.</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally with each of the three pieces of proof, you&rsquo;ll want to re-present them two to three times in different ways.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is called a &ldquo;reframe.&rdquo;</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Reframing The Proof</h3>
    <p class="c0">So in the above example, the copywriter provided a visual chart AND told the reader about the monetary gains.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s two&nbsp;<u class="c24">presentations</u>.</p>
    <p class="c0">How else could the copywriter &ldquo;show&rdquo; the reader how much money they were getting? </p>
    <p class="c0">A good copywriter will try reframe proof often.</p>
    <p class="c0">Continuing the previous example&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000!</p>
    <p class="c0">Use my proprietary system to collect that much every month and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s a reframe.</p>
    <p class="c0">I changed the frame from a one-time $10,000 win into a &ldquo;yearly income.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not difficult, see?</p>
    <p class="c0">All you need to do for a reframe is present a new perspective on the same information.</p>
    <p class="c0">Another easy way for a copywriter to reframe their proof is just to make a simple, relatable comparison.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s try another.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000!</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s 765 times more money that what you would have made sticking your money in the S&amp;P 500 for the entire year!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">When a copywriter reframes their proof, they are making the proof &ldquo;three-dimensional.&rdquo; In a reader&rsquo;s mind, it becomes more tangible. &nbsp;More real.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you start to binge copywriting, you will now translate this reframe pattern constantly&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">As a result, you&rsquo;ll start to see new and clever ways to reframe simple pieces of proof.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Showing the Reader The Benefit</h2>
    <p class="c0">Everyone always says, talk about benefits over features.</p>
    <p class="c0">Finally, here&rsquo;s a copywriter&rsquo;s big chance.</p>
    <p class="c0">Step 1: They&rsquo;ve anticipated the objection&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Step 2: They&rsquo;ve stated a claim that combats the objection&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Step 3: They&rsquo;ve presented three pieces of proof that support the claim AND reframed each to make them three-dimensional&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s time to talk benefits.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d do it:</p>
    <p class="c0">Continuing our example after our third piece of proof&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000!</p>
    <p class="c0">Make that much every month with this system and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income! Won&rsquo;t you be the talk of the town?</p>
    <p class="c0">Imagine it&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">People will whisper about you, &lsquo;how did he afford that fancy new car?&rsquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">&lsquo;Did you see his new pool?&rsquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">&lsquo;What about that trip to Italy he took his family on! Where did he get ALL THAT MONEY?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">In this example, I didn&rsquo;t state the benefits directly at the reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">I &ldquo;showed&rdquo; him the benefits in action.</p>
    <p class="c0">I showed him the life he could have.</p>
    <p class="c0">A very easy way a copywriter can illustrate (show don&rsquo;t tell) the benefits to the reader is simply by writing the word: &ldquo;Imagine&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then write out whatever the reader would enjoy imagining.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Imagine the look on your friend&rsquo;s faces when you knock 10 strokes off your golf game.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;Imagine sleeping easy every night because our debt consolidation service lowered your payments by hundreds of dollars a month.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">To keep the copy fresh and avoid an echo&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">A copywriter can just erase the word &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; and tell the reader about the benefits they&rsquo;ll experience.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll speak with confidence and make friends easily after attending this public speaking class.&rdquo;</p>
    
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Dark Tip About Benefits</h2>
    <p class="c0">Let me share something with you that I have found to be universally true.</p>
    <p class="c0">Things that people consider the most personal, are actually the most common.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is, everyone&rsquo;s personal shame is EVERYONE&rsquo;S personal shame.</p>
    <p class="c0">Are you jealous of your successful, beautiful best friend who has had it so easy their whole life? </p>
    <p class="c0">So is everyone else.</p>
    <p class="c0">Do you resent how you allowed yourself to be manipulated in your last relationship&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">or all your relationships?</p>
    <p class="c0">So does everyone else.</p>
    <p class="c0">Do you think you are unlovable for something that you did or happened to you years ago? </p>
    <p class="c0">Unfortunately, so do most people.</p>
    <p class="c0">And maybe not all of these apply to you&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But it is a hell of a bountiful place to start when thinking up how you&rsquo;ll describe benefits.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everyone wants relief from their fears and frustrations.</p>
    <p class="c0">They want to stick it to their smug brother in law&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or their controlling father&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or their Math teacher who said they wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everyone wants to be somebody.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everyone wants to feel loved, special, and important.</p>
    <p class="c0">Everyone wants a life of leisure and pleasure.</p>
    <p class="c0">The truth is&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Those things that everyone thinks are most personal and private&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Are actually the most universal.</p>
    <p class="c0">Ugly truths we don&rsquo;t want to face about our natures.</p>
    <p class="c0">But hey, that&rsquo;s just part of being human.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Seven Deadly Benefits</h2>
    <p class="c0">Another way to think about this &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of benefits stuff, is to consider the seven deadly sins.</p>

    <h2 class="c6">Wrapping Up The Body Copy Template</h2>
    <p class="c0">There you have it&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">When you look at nearly any piece of copy, particularly long-form&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll find that the very best performers in the world follow this simple step-by-step template in their body copy:</p>
    
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_15-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Objection</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Claim</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Proof</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Benefit</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">The next time you read a piece of body copy, you should now be able to dissect virtually every line&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll be able to easily translate each line to determine what stage the writer is at in their communication.</p>
    <p class="c0">Are they communicating a claim that they want you to believe?</p>
    <p class="c0">Are they communicating proof as to WHY you should believe them? Or are they communicating a benefit?</p>
    <p class="c0">Are they showing you how, if you&rsquo;ll just listen to them, your wildest dreams will come true?</p>
    <p class="c0">Seeing this pattern will become second nature to you, now that it is part of your copywriting lexicon.</p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll be surprised how universal it is.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Common Sections in the Body Copy</h2>
    <p class="c0">Now that you know how to present your information, I&rsquo;m going to list some common sections in the body copy and go over them with you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes these ideas are presented in the lead in a single line&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then elaborated further in the body copy with an entire section following the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template.</p>
    <p class="c0">The following list of sections aren&rsquo;t official definitions you&rsquo;ve read anywhere else in the world&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because they are names I personally gave to patterns I recognized while translating literally thousands of pages of copy.</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_15-0">
        <li class="c6 c8">Better Than Section</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">The Last Time This Happened Section</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Guru/Credibility Section</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Discovery Story</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Key Insight</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Layman&rsquo;s Explanation</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Technical Explanation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">The first two sections listed are a little unique.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because it is common for these to be in the grey area that could be LEAD or body copy, depending on who you talk to.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">But they do follow the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Two Quick Tips for Building A Strong Lead And Starting the Body Copy With A Bang</h2>
    <p class="c0">There are two sections of copy I really like to include in a lead where I&rsquo;m presenting a large opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">I typically use these two sections in a customer acquisition sales letter, or a &ldquo;front end&rdquo; promotion.</p>
    <p class="c0">A front-end promotion is a low-priced offer of around $50 or less&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s designed to get the customer to buy something from you and get into your customer list.</p>
    <p class="c0">&nbsp;A back-end promotion is a high-priced offer of anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 or beyond&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s designed to generate a ton of profits.</p>
    <p class="c0">You don&rsquo;t need to know much more than that.</p>
    <p class="c0">With what I&rsquo;ve taught you thus far, the next two sections should make sense&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And once you grasp the core concepts I show you, you&rsquo;ll be able to immediately translate these sections into what any copywriter is really trying to communicate.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section</h2>
    <p class="c0">The first section I call The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And it is exactly what it sounds like!</p>
    <p class="c0">After you hit all the core elements of a lead as explained above, you simply want to communicate the following message in a subhead&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;This opportunity is &lsquo;better than&rsquo; the best, hottest thing out there right now.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Since I write financial copy, I love to go to something like Amazon or Facebook for this section.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance, FAANG stocks were all the rave in 2018.</p>
    <p class="c0">Investors thought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google were the MUST HAVE stocks.</p>
    <p class="c0">So, for a &ldquo;better than&rdquo; section I might say something like:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;This single opportunity will deliver bigger profits than all the FAANG stocks put together!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my claim.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then I would find a quote or figure about my opportunity from a news source&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">One that would support the idea that you could make more with my opportunity than the FAANG stocks&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then I might grab a chart or think of a comparison to draw&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">And then one other piece of proof.</p>
    <p class="c0">Bingo bango, that&rsquo;s one awesome &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section all done.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">What Does A &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section Communicate?</h2>
    <p class="c0">The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section simultaneously builds the hype for your opportunity&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Which makes it perfect for around the lead&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">While also selling the reader OUT of doing the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment.</p>
    <p class="c0">Selling out of something basically means selling &ldquo;away&rdquo; from something&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s the process of selling someone on NOT doing something else.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because one objection the reader might have is, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just do this thing that&rsquo;s hot right now?&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">I recommend you knock that objection out early.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now, which emotion I communicate is up to the angle of my claim and the proof I fetch.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance, if I say &ldquo;you can make more money with my opportunity than with FAANG stocks&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Then I am communicating my opportunity is BIG.</p>
    <p class="c0">If I say my opportunity has consistently outperformed FAANG, I am communicating it is BIG and SAFE.</p>
    <p class="c0">So pick and choose what you want to specifically communicate for your opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">But no matter what: I MUST communicate one of The Big 4 or the section is worthless.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example of the Better Than section from The Hottest IPO and it will pick up where my last example left off&hellip;</p>

                    <p class="c0">For example, the mainstream media likes to say that Bitcoin is the best performance asset in the entire world.</p>
                    <p class="c0">Sure, Bitcoin has minted tons of millionaires.</p>
                    <p class="c0">But this private company is making people even more money!</p>
                    <p class="c0">Over the last 12 months, Bitcoin has delivered around 800% returns for investors.</p>
                    <p class="c0">But we have seen over 900,000% gains from this private startup.</p>
                    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s over 1,000 times higher than Bitcoin!</p>
                    <p class="c0">No wonder Business Insider calls this company &ldquo;the most valuable startup in the U.S. and across the globe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="c0">When The Hottest IPO was written, Bitcoin was all the hype.</p>
    <p class="c0">It was the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment I needed to sell away from.</p>
    <p class="c0">When I re-wrote the lead of Hottest IPO for the $15 Trillion Gadget, it made sense to update my example.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here is how the &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section was presented in the $15 Trillion Gadget.</p>

    <h2 class="c6 c21">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="c6">The Second One I Call &ldquo;The Last Time Something Like This Happened&rdquo; (TLTSLTH) Section</h2>
    <p class="c0">This can go early in the copy, near the lead because it is a Big, hype-driven section.</p>
    <p class="c0">To employ the TLTSLTH section, simply communicate the following message in a subhead: </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The last time something like this happened was over 25 years ago!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then I tell the story about what happened 25 years ago&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger.</p>
    <p class="c6 c53">&ldquo;The last time something like this opportunity happened, people became wildly happy!&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c6 c53">So for something like financial copywriting, you might write something like:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;The last time a tax bill like this was passed, millionaires were minted overnight.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Then you explain how people got rich from a similar opportunity&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger.</p>
    <p class="c0">By showing a historical case study, I have introduced a pattern&hellip; </p>

    <h2 class="c6">The Guru/Credibility Section</h2>
    <p class="c0">The Guru or &ldquo;Credibility&rdquo; section is pretty much ubiquitous in all pieces of copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s also where I draw a hard, black and white line for transition from the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;body copy.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">When you see the credibility section, you are officially in the body copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">The credibility section is designed to overcome the &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why should I listen to you?&rdquo; objections.</p>
    <p class="c0">So while you are binging and translating copywriting you&rsquo;ll notice the credibility section communicates: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That is the copywriter&rsquo;s claim: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, the copywriter will introduce the guru and then list some reasons the guru is credible.</p>
    <p class="c0">That can include photos with prominent, credible people&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">A list of appearances on authority sources, like being on TV and news networks&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or a track record of success or accurate predictions.</p>
    <p class="c0">Usually, you won&rsquo;t see case studies or testimonials at this point.</p>
    <p class="c0">Those are mostly reserved for the Offer Copy, which we will cover in a little bit.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example Guru Section from The Hottest IPO&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Notice the variety of sources that really show the reader: &ldquo;James Altucher is a very credible guy you should listen to!&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image39.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6 c21">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="c6">The Discovery Story</h2>
    <p class="c0">The discovery story or &ldquo;key insight&rdquo; section usually tells the story of how the guru came across this breakthrough opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">It addresses the objection: &ldquo;how do you know about this?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And usually communicates some element of New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That is, the story could be about a key piece of information gathered from a secret source&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or some elite network&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The proof would simply be offering proof such a relationship exists between the guru and the secret source.</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Made Up Example:</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a made up example off the top of my head, and we will build on this in the coming sections&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c-indented c0">&ldquo;As you know, I have worked on government projects before.</p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">And on one of these projects I overheard a secret meeting.</em></p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">Afterward, I approached one of the men and asked him about it, and what he shared with me blew my mind.</em></p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">I can&rsquo;t tell you all the details here&hellip;</em></p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">All you need to know is this is the most explosive opportunity I&rsquo;ve ever come across.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">This example lets the reader know there is a secret government opportunity only our guru knows about.</p>
    <p class="c0">So you just want to communicate that this information is not available to the whole world.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, it was by chance that our guru luckily discovered this opportunity, thanks to his personal circumstances.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s Big 4 Emotion New/&ldquo;Only.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how we did that for The 70 Cent Crypto:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image11.png" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Then the writer can transition into the key insight section.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Key Insight</h2>
    <p class="c0">The key insight is the single piece (or pieces) of information the reader must know to be true in order to believe the opportunity is real.</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Continuing the Made-Up Example:</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s expand upon our made-up secret government opportunity from earlier&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">&ldquo;The mysterious man told me about a secret government contract with major chip manufacturers around the world that would set up a $250 billion industry.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">How can you make the reader believe this is true?</p>
    <p class="c0">The writer can back this big claim up with proof using &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of things to come.</p>
    <p class="c0">The writing is on the wall so to speak. (Safe/Predictable)</p>
    <p class="c0">A writer may say something like&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">&ldquo;Even though everyone has been kept hush hush, several prominent chip companies have quietly enjoyed explosion in their stocks recently.</em></p>
    <p class="c-indented c0"><em class="c18">That&rsquo;s because the insiders know what&rsquo;s happening and they&rsquo;re pouring in money now.&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p class="c0">Again I&rsquo;m just making all this up.</p>
    <p class="c0">But because I speak the language of copywriting&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I know what message I must communicate, and it just flows from my fingers.</p>
    <p class="c0">I just need to tell you that I know one important piece of information that is setting up something big.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then I write what that might sound like.</p>
    <p class="c0">My skills have sharpened from binging copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">And now the patterns have become so obvious to me, almost to the point of being dull.</p>
    <p class="c0">It took me about a year to learn and develop this method.</p>
    <p class="c0">And now, thanks to this guide, you&rsquo;ll be able to speak the copywriting language in no time&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And replicate my skill in a matter of weeks.</p>
    <p class="c0">Real copy example:</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a real example of how we used our key piece of information about &ldquo;IBM&rsquo;s announcement&rdquo; in 70 Cent Crypto:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image12.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">The reader must understand that IBM is on board with this crypto and that their involvement is what will cause this whole opportunity to work.</p>
    <p class="c0">I backed that claim up with examples of old announcements for other cryptos that took place before a crypto exploded in price.</p>
    <p class="c0">Another challenge in this promo was convincing the reader that Bitcoin was on its way out, and our coin was the better coin.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s the key insight we used to prove that point:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image13.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation</h2>
    <p class="c0">The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation addresses the objection: &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">But the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is only one part of addressing that objection&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">More on that in a moment.</p>
    <p class="c0">Basically, The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is where you&rsquo;ll explain how the opportunity functions&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And do so in a way that two people half-drunk at the bar would be able to explain it to each other.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is a cousin of the key insight.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember the Big 4 emotions when creating The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation.</p>
    <p class="c0">So, picture two people hunched over at the bar.</p>
    <p class="c0">Their faces are red and their eyes are half-closed from drinking too much.</p>
    <p class="c0">Person 1 says to Person 2, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bunch of bullshit.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll believe anything you read online.&rdquo; What Person 2 says in reply IS the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation section.</p>
    <p class="c0">If it&rsquo;s a system you&rsquo;re selling, the drunkard will reply with something like&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple. You just follow these three steps and BAM. Success.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">Listen, the secret is the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">It&rsquo;s this new thing scientists discovered that makes the whole thing work. &nbsp;</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. &nbsp;Until I heard about that &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">I&rsquo;m telling you... &nbsp;This is the real deal.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><em class="c18"></em></p>
    <p class="c0">If it is our government contract example I just made up above, Person 2&rsquo;s reply would be something like: </p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">Ya know how the government spends billions of dollars every year on war? </em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">Well now there&rsquo;s a NEW sector and it&rsquo;s WAY cheaper than the old way...</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">So the government is going all in RIGHT NOW! I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">They got these computers now that can do 500 times what the old technology did and at a fraction of the cost!</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. Until I heard about that new sector.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">I&rsquo;m telling you&hellip; This is the real deal.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><em class="c18"></em></p>
    <p class="c0">Again, I&rsquo;m totally making all this stuff up on the spot.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">I know I must communicate a SIMPLE key piece of information that a person falling over drunk could communicate to a skeptical friend at the bar.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s what I call: &ldquo;The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image14.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">If you were drunk at the bar with a friend&hellip; could you explain this to them? </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;This dude has this secret formula&hellip; or crazy algorithm&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">And it PREDICTS the stock market. &nbsp;I know, it sounds crazy. But it was over 90% accurate!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though the copywriter talks a bunch of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; about the algorithm in the above section, he doesn&rsquo;t really tell you how it works&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Just that &ldquo;it works.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Technical Explanation</h2>
    <p class="c0">The Technical Explanation is just the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation dressed up in a lab coat with glasses.</p>
    <p class="c0">If it were a system I were selling, I would go into crazy detail about the science behind the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">So much detail as to fly over the head of the reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that is by design.</p>
    <p class="c0">For instance, I could present the complicated scientific formula that makes it all work.</p>
    <p class="c0">This communicates, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smarter than you. &nbsp;Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">For the made-up government contracts example we have above, I could talk about computer chips in more detail.</p>
    <p class="c0">I could mention the microns and nanosecond reaction times or something.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how they did it in The Money Zone:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image15.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">The copywriter is throwing so much jargon and technical stuff at the reader so they will think to themselves, &ldquo;Okay, okay, I don&rsquo;t understand any of this stuff. I&rsquo;m not a computer genius. Whatever.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though the reader doesn&rsquo;t actually want to know or learn this complicated stuff, they want reassurance the guru DOES know it.</p>
    <p class="c0">Safe/Predictable.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Wrapping Up The Body Copy</h2>
    <p class="c0">You now know some of the most common elements of the body copy section in a piece of copy.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.2xcytpi">The stuff you&rsquo;ve learned is verypowerful.</p>
    <p class="c0">I must confess that I am feeling a desire to invest in one of those government contract chip companies we made up&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though I KNOW logically, that I just made all that stuff up about a new &ldquo;sector&rdquo; and government opportunity</p>
    <p class="c0">I know, logically, that opportunity doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But my emotions are not rational.</p>
    <p class="c0">They do not understand logic.</p>
    <p class="c0">They are reactive, and the words I typed in the make-believe examples are emotionally exciting.</p>
    <p class="c0">The language of copywriting is communicated purely through subtext.</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">The language of copywriting isn&rsquo;t about what is said, it is about what is communicated.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">The things REALLY being communicating by a skilled copywriter will bypass the reader&rsquo;s rational, logical levels of the brain&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And go directly to pulling their emotional strings.</p>
    <p class="c0">In learning how to translate that language yourself&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You are learning how to communicate directly to a human being&rsquo;s emotional and core desires.</p>
    
    <h1 class="c6">Section 4: The Offer</h1>
    <p class="c0">Hooray, we&rsquo;ve made it to the offer! </p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s all downhill from here&hellip; sort of.</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, the offer section in long form direct response copy occupies the last twenty to thirty percent of the text.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s very similar to the format of any &ldquo;free webinar&rdquo; you might have attended.</p>
    <p class="c0">You get about 45 minutes of content&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Followed by a 15-minute pitch&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And sometimes, if the webinar host is feeling generous, you get about 30-40 minutes Q&amp;A.</p>
    <p class="c0">Frankly, it&rsquo;s no different in copywriting&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because webinars are based on high performing sales techniques and often scripted by copywriters!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">What To Look For In An Offer</h2>
    <p class="c0">A ton of information must be conveyed quickly and directly in an offer&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">This is the part of your copy where you will be asking a reader to whip out their credit card, so you want to make sure they have NO reason not to&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">That means being crystal clear with details and instructions for them to follow.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here are the most common elements that make up the offer section:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Summarize everything discussed so far</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Intro report</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Intro service</li>
        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-1 start">
            <li class="c6 c8">The unique selling proposition</li>
            <li class="c6 c8">How it works / What to expect / What you get</li>
            <li class="c6 c8">Pump in some cred</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="c6 c8">Add bonuses</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Share testimonials</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Recap</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Offer guarantee</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Limit the Spots or Quantity</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Set a deadline</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Ask for sale</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="c0">These do not have to be presented in a specific order&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But the order I&rsquo;ve presented above is pretty clean and effective.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember to keep the Big 4 top of mind when writing every word of your copy&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Even the offer section.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because directly stating information about something, is NOT copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">That is educating...</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.1ci93xb"><strong class="c13">That&rsquo;s a blog post.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">If you are telling, you aren&rsquo;t selling.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">So there is an art that comes in conveying your information and instruction&hellip;.</p>
    <p class="c0">While continuing to SELL them on the offer section.</p>
    <p class="c0">The persuasive message must continue to be subtly communicated, while being intertwined with the information.</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t skip over that part&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Because that is &ldquo;the copywriting part.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I hope you&rsquo;re excited to learn how to structure and create a compelling offer in this section.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you learn to spot these patterns in the copy, and tease out what a copywriter is really communicating&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You will be able to write your own offer copy with ease.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A Membership or Subscription Service Is One of the Most Complicated Offers</h2>
    <p class="c0">The reason membership and subscription offers are so complicated is because the SELLER is usually selling a subscription&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">While the BUYER is usually interested in buying into the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; or &ldquo;system&rdquo; that has been teased throughout the copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">As such, the offer section will require an introduction of both the &ldquo;report&rdquo; that explains the opportunity&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And then must also introduce the subscription service itself.</p>
    <p class="c0">So let&rsquo;s take my government contract example I made up earlier.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;ve explained to you there is a huge opportunity to profit off these secret government contracts&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And I&rsquo;ve put all the details for you in a nice little report.</p>
    <p class="c0">The report is called, Report X.</p>
    <p class="c0">Guess what? Report X is free.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here are the details inside: x&hellip; y&hellip; and z&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">i.e. &ldquo;Inside you&rsquo;ll learn: Exactly how to profit, what ticker symbol to invest in, and my sophisticated, full research.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The report will reveal everything the reader desperately wants to know that was only teased in the sales letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">But the objective of the copywriter is to get a new subscriber&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">So they might write something like:</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">&ldquo;But in order to receive the free report, you must subscribe to my newsletter or membership service, &lsquo;The ABC Club&rsquo; for $49 per year.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Get it now? I&rsquo;m actually selling the subscription service.</p>
    <p class="c0">That just adds a slight wrinkle to information you must convey in the offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">But it&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can use a similar setup for anything else you&rsquo;re selling.</p>
    <p class="c0">If I&rsquo;m selling basketball training&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I could write an entire sales letter about, <em>“The one secret to being a better basketball player than Lebron James.”</em></p>
    <p class="c0">I could talk about that one secret the whole time.</p>
    <p class="c0">I could illustrate how it is New, Safe, Easy, and Big.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then say,<em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the secret when you join my basketball training club.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">Until the offer section, the reader may have never known there was a club! </p>
    <p class="c0">And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s up to you what items you select to highlight in your copy...</p>
    <p class="c0">You may want to test a couple angles and find the best performing one, then ditch the others.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example of introducing the report and subscription service from The 70 Cent Crypto.</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image16.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">There&rsquo;s a lot happening in this example.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s just focus on the report and subscription service.</p>
    <p class="c0">At the top we introduce the information the reader wants, using a dossier: The $.70 Crypto That Could Make You Rich in 2018.</p>
    <p class="c0">At the bottom we introduce the subscription service that will grant you access.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then we explain that in order to get the dossier, you must join the subscription service:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image17.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Working Backwards and Building Your Offer</h2>
    <p class="c0">In just a second we&rsquo;ll dive full into the elements of an offer section&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see exactly what information you must tell&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But I want to remind you about the most important aspect about the language of copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be happy to know, there are still only 4 main things you&rsquo;ll want to keep top of mind when writing an offer:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_13-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">New/Only</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Easy/Anybody</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Safe/Predictable</strong></li>
        <li class="c6 c8"><strong class="c13">Big/Fast</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">So when you&rsquo;re reading an offer by a master copywriter, see if you can recognize examples of them weaving the Big 4 (and their alter-egos) into the information to make it more exciting.</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting long enough&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s dive into the elements of typical offer copy.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Summarize Everything Discussed Before</h2>
    <p class="c0">In the lesson on body copy, you learned that body copy follows a typical structure of: Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit format.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once one claim is proven and the benefits presented, there is an opportunity for the copywriter to weave in a quick reminder about the opportunity before moving on and presenting a new claim in the next section.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the following part of the offer copy should stick out like a sore thumb&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll notice you are about 70 percent through the copy and it seems like you&rsquo;re re-reading the lead all over again.</p>
    <p class="c0">No new information is being presented&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">No new claim is being proven&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">At this point your brain will see the pattern: You know you are reaching the offer copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">In a moment, the writer will present you with the opportunity to &ldquo;get in&rdquo; on what he&rsquo;s been hyping up, via some product offer or report.</p>
    <p class="c0">So in order to get you in the state of mind to badly want that thing (usually a report)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">He is going to use the same hype from the lead to get you hype again.</p>
    <p class="c0">This part will be similar to the lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes instead of presenting claims, the writer will suggest he has fulfilled all their claims from earlier.</p>
    <p class="c0">Like this:</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the proof that X Claim is happening&hellip; <br>I&rsquo;ve shown you the proof about Y Claim.</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">And now you can get the details in X Report.&rdquo; </em></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from The 70 Cent Crypto:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image18.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">Here it is in The Hottest IPO:</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image19.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Intro Report</h2>
    <p class="c0">See how easily that flowed?</p>
    <p class="c0">We recapped, rebuilt the hype that caused you to read in the first place, then presented you with an opportunity to &ldquo;get in.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll also notice, we REALLY jack up the urgency as we get closer and closer to the close of the letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">More on urgency in a moment.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you see a copywriter intro the report, you&rsquo;ll notice the copywriter doesn&rsquo;t give away the specifics inside.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead, they tell you about the information you, the reader, hope to get from inside.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">&ldquo;Once you have this report, it will only take you 5 minutes and 3 clicks of your mouse to get in front of this life-changing opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Notice that in this made-up example, I don&rsquo;t go into boring details inside the report.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead, I stick to my core emotions, the Big 4 Emotions.</p>
    <p class="c0">This particular line, I highlight how easy, fast, and big this all is.</p>
    <p class="c0">And the fact that they don&rsquo;t know the information in my report and I am holding it, triggers New/Only.</p>
    <p class="c0">Bam. All four hit.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I didn&rsquo;t give away anything.</p>
    <p class="c0">Not only is withholding the details MORE effective&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Divulging the details is INEFFECTIVE and actually HARMFUL.</p>
    <p class="c0">There&rsquo;s two reasons for that.</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">Information is not sexy</li>
        <li class="c6 c15">The reader may believe they have this &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo; </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="">Point one: Information is not sexy.</p>
    <p class="c0">The human brain cannot deal with raw data.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sure, it can solve problems and calculate things&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But it cannot come to an emotional or motivated conclusion based on facts.</p>
    <p class="c0">It needs a story to guide that motivation.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s what copywriting is.</p>
    <p class="c0">So always remember&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though the reader wants this information, BADLY even&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Giving it to them will NOT work.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because it is not scientifically possible to excite them to action with raw data.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you activate their calculating, analytical part of the brain, even for a moment, that kills all the momentum you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, make sure that you are mostly presenting stories in your body copy too.</p>
    <p class="c0">Never just use raw data as proof.</p>
    <p class="c0">As for the second point: the reader cannot be allowed to think they have your secret &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">&nbsp;The moment they think,<em> “Oh I think I know what this secret is… I can do this on my own…”</em></p>
    <p class="c0">...Then they are gone.</p>
    <p class="c0">They&rsquo;ll either try to do it on their own&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0"><strong class="c13">Or they will try and find another version of your secret for cheaper, if they think they know what your thing is.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">You must never allow your opportunity <strong class="c13">to be categorized as a commodity.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">If that happens, it&rsquo;s &nbsp;over.</p>
    <p class="c0">On that note: You can keep your report from being &ldquo;another boring old report&rdquo; by calling it something else.</p>
    <p class="c0">Anything else!</p>
    <p class="c0">Dossier, Bulletin, Hot Sheet, Guide, Manual.</p>
    <p class="c0">These are just a few quick examples.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll notice we called the report in The 70 Cent Crypto a &ldquo;dossier.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">And we called the Pre-IPO Prospectus a &ldquo;prospectus.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">But I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to write.</p>
    <p class="c0">That would not serve you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Writing copy is not a &ldquo;how to.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead, you must binge on copy, translate out the subtext, and then you&rsquo;ll know what to look for when you see another writer Intro the Report in their offer section.</p>
    <p class="c0">After seeing a couple examples, you&rsquo;ll quickly come up with New, unique names for your own report with a little bit of thought.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see ways to weave New, Safe, Easy, and Big into your report tease.</p>
    <p class="c0">At this point, the copywriter has summarized the exciting stuff&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Introduced their report and teased some key information&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And now they&rsquo;ll drop a line like:</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; <br>As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">Or&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;As soon as you RSVP your spot in my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c6 c3 c59"><em class="c18"></em></p>
    <h2 class="c6">Intro The Service</h2>
    <p class="c0">This is the real offer you want to the reader to take&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">A quick note about the &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; line&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; </em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">Usually the words trial offer only appear in front end products, where the price is $49 and they can get their money back if unsatisfied.</p>
    <p class="c0">The words &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t usually appear in back end offers&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Because back end offers are priced at $2,000 and above&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And you don&rsquo;t want the customer to buy, steal the information in the report, and then ask for a refund.</p>
    <p class="c0">So most folks do not offer a &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; for back ends.</p>
    <p class="c0">Many folks do not offer refunds for back ends at all.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ve seen examples of how a writer might introduce the report and then the service&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And you&rsquo;ll pick up more as you binge copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">So now what?</p>
    <p class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s time to sell the service itself.</p>
    <p class="c0">The first thing to do&hellip;</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Explain the Unique Selling Proposition (USP)</h3>
    <p class="c0">The unique selling proposition is what makes your service DIFFERENT.</p>
    <p class="c0">The USP will trigger New/Only for your reader and your presentation can be pretty straight forward: </p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented c18">“The only service that...” </p>
    <p class="c0">...and you say the logical thing that comes to mind.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">It may be the only service that uses the special system you&rsquo;ve been teasing.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or the only service that does things the special way they do&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or has the special people involved that are involved.</p>
    <p class="c0">It just has to be &ldquo;unique&rdquo; to be a unique selling proposition.</p>
    <p class="c0">One thing that is important, and many people get hung up on...</p>
    <p class="c0">Your USP doesn&rsquo;t even have to be THAT &ldquo;unique.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Sounds like I&rsquo;m contradicting myself now, huh? </p>
    <p class="c0">So there are three ways to create a USP.</p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_12-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c6 c8">Have something actually unique</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Label something common as unique</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Give something &ldquo;old&rdquo; a new name</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="c6">Actually Unique</h3>
    <p class="c0">You can use something truly unique, like a proprietary formula or patented technology or process&hellip;</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Label Something Common as Unique</h3>
    <p class="c0">Or you can highlight something COMMON about your product that nobody else has highlighted before.</p>
    <p class="c0">A classic example comes from a company that was having trouble selling fire alarms.</p>
    <p class="c0">They brought on a copywriter who asked how the alarms were made.</p>
    <p class="c0">After going over how the alarms were made, the copywriter said, &ldquo;These connectors are gold plated.</p>
    <p class="c0">We should sell that.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The manufacturer said, &ldquo;all company&rsquo;s connectors are gold plated.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter said, &ldquo;but nobody is talking about it!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">I got that story from Joseph Sugarman&rsquo;s Adweek Copywriting Handbook, I believe.</p>
    <h3 class="c6">Give Something &ldquo;Old&rdquo; A New Name</h3>
    <p class="c0">The South Beach diet failed in its first several iterations because it was named &ldquo;The modified carbohydrate diet.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That was not new and not sexy.</p>
    <p class="c0">So they called the same old thing something new, &ldquo;The South Beach Diet&rdquo; and bam, national success.</p>
    <p class="c0">One more example&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">The iPod was not an original idea.</p>
    <p class="c0">There were TONS of MP3 players all over the market, made by a zillion manufacturers.</p>
    <p class="c0">But Steve Jobs in his infinite wisdom decided to market the iPod as &ldquo;1,000 songs in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">All of a sudden, Apple&rsquo;s MP3 player was super unique and exciting.</p>
    <p class="c0">It didn&rsquo;t play songs differently than any other MP3 player, but it sure was the most popular.</p>
    <p class="c0">It will only take reading a handful of examples before you really spot this trend and quickly come up with your own ideas.</p>
    <p class="c0">Another very common way to communicate the USP is to start a sentence with &ldquo;my mission with Service XYZ is to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how we did it in The Hottest IPO&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image20.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">Notice how we make The Altucher Report unique by labeling it the &ldquo;ONLY place where I&rsquo;ll personally update you on emerging new ways to earn more income and grow your wealth&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone introduced their service and made it unique:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image1.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">How it Works / What to Expect / What You Get</h2>
    <p class="c0">The next thing you have to do once you have told the reader why your product is unique, is tell them what to expect from their experience.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll notice copywriters make it as clear as possible, answering questions like: What comes with this service or membership?</p>
    <p class="c0">How often will I receive an email? </p>
    <p class="c0">What will be in the emails?</p>
    <p class="c0">Pro Tip: put a graphic of an actual email&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Presented like a sheet of paper with the letter head and text and everything&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">That way the reader can see it, and it will help them recognize the format, the branding, and most importantly&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">What to expect!</p>
    <p class="c0">This is also a great time to include anything else that comes standard with the offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">That could be special access to an exclusive website, a customer service number, or any other regular emails they might receive.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because your competitors will probably be offering similar things, you will want to &ldquo;dress&rdquo; your standard offering &ldquo;up.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see it in the copy while you&rsquo;re binging.</p>
    <p class="c0">Call your report something weird.</p>
    <p class="c0">Call your website something weird.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead of just saying, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s our customer service phone number,&rdquo; say something like, &ldquo;We have a dedicated team of specialists to support you for this project. Here&rsquo;s their number.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">No matter where you are in the copy, every element should feel New.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you are in the offer section, it is really tempting to just say, &ldquo;this is what you want, here it is&hellip;&rdquo; and just give them the information.</p>
    <p class="c0">But you have to fight against that urge.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even in the offer section, you should make every effort to keep the reader from thinking, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And while making your offer, remember, specifics are key.</p>
    <p class="c0">And in the specifics, you want to emphasize how EASY you&rsquo;ve made everything.</p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll receive an email from me every Monday morning when the markets open.<br><br>Inside I&rsquo;ll include commentary about the markets, one trade recommendation, and step by step instructions to execute that trade if you wish to invest.<br><br>Everything you need to get in the trade is right there in the email, and you can be in any of these trades in mere minutes.<br><br>You don&rsquo;t need a special brokerage account, any old one will do...</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c18 c-indented"><em class="c18">You don&rsquo;t need a specific amount of money, either.<br><br>In fact, anybody can follow these simple instructions with just an internet connection and 10 minutes of time.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">I just made all that up.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">As someone who speaks the language of copy, I don&rsquo;t have to really consult any outside resources or think hard about this stuff.</p>
    <p class="c0">I know I just need to make this part sound really EASY.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because after thousands of hours binging copy&hellip; not reading ABOUT copy&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">I have seen that all the <strong class="c13">great copywriters lean heavily on the Easy emotion in this section.</strong></p>
    <p class="c0">Now that you have learned this part of the offer, you&rsquo;ll see it too!</p>
    <p class="c0">As you start to binge great copy on your own, it will only couple examples for you to instantly recognize creative ways writers make their offer section seem unique and exciting&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you&rsquo;ll be able to write your own with ease.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Money Zone promo did a terrific job at this:</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image2.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h3 class="c6">Pump in Some Cred</h3>
    <p class="c0">There is no specific spot to drop this&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But now is a good time to remind the reader of the guru&rsquo;s credibility before moving onto bonuses.</p>
    <p class="c0">Something like a quick look at the track record or appearances on TV will do.</p>
    <p class="c0">Not testimonials, though.</p>
    <p class="c0">Weave testimonials in between bonuses or save them for after.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Money Zone does this right before they go into bonuses:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image3.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Add Bonuses</h2>
    <p class="c0">At this point the reader knows what they are getting and how it will work.</p>
    <p class="c0">And right after that, many great copywriters &ldquo;spice up&rdquo; their offer with some cool bonuses.</p>
    <p class="c0">Bonuses can be anything, really.</p>
    <p class="c0">Consider bonuses as cherries on top of your big opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s consider my make-believe government contracts example...</p>
    <p class="c0">We are offering a big free report for the opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">The report reveals the stock of a computer chip manufacturer that will profit huge from a secret government contract.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">This will give investors a ton of money overnight.</p>
    <p class="c0">So I could offer a bonus report about another profitable investing sector where the government has big, profitable contracts.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or I could offer a bonus report about other investing sectors that will benefit from the computer chips themselves.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or I could send them some sort of physical product&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Like a free laptop that contains the very computer chip the company makes! </p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, you should make your bonuses related to your big opportunity.</p>
    <p class="c0">In my personal opinion, tacking on random unrelated bonuses subtracts from the strength of your original offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">You wouldn&rsquo;t want to tack a &ldquo;how to buy gold&rdquo; bonus at the end of your cryptocurrency letter.</p>
    <p class="c0">(These two are basically at polar opposite ends of the investing ideology pole)</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s probably the only rule I would put on bonuses.</p>
    <p class="c0">You might think, &ldquo;Why would anybody do that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">The quick answer is: because it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sometimes people have leftover bonuses or free software they can bundle and throw in with their offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">So they just bundle a bunch of random stuff and throw it at the reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">Again, to me, that just cheapens your original pitch. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s my two cents.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just try to get creative when you can. &nbsp;There is a lack of creativity in this world.</p>
    <p class="c0">Keep your eyes peeled for creative bonuses while you&rsquo;re binging copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">In Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass, we tried to include bonuses that went along with our theme of safe, predictable income.</p>
    <p class="c0">We offered a bonus report called - &ldquo;The Recession Proof Portfolio: Five Assets That NEVER Go Out of Style.&rdquo;</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image4.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Testimonials</h2>
    <p class="c0">The key for good testimonials, is to try and mimic the reader as much as possible in their presentation.</p>
    <p class="c0">That includes mirroring your target market&rsquo;s physical features in images, and their economic and life status where you can.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even locations where you know your target market might be concentrated.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">A quick and easy way to mimic your reader is by using photos, even stock photos will do, of people who should resemble your ideal reader.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you are writing mostly for old white men, find some images of old white men to plug in beside the testimonials.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you are writing for young female yoga enthusiasts, find some images of young ladies performing yoga.</p>
    <p class="c0">For all graphics, if you didn&rsquo;t PAY for them - make sure to only use royalty free images and/or images labeled for commercial use.</p>
    <p class="c0">Basically, don&rsquo;t grab random images off Google.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s an easy way to get in trouble.</p>
    <p class="c0">The best testimonials include the most specifics.</p>
    <p class="c0">Example 1: <em class="c18">&ldquo;This service is great!&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s a pretty cool testimonial.</p>
    <p class="c0">But let&rsquo;s look at one (made up example) with more specifics&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Example 2: <em class="c18">&ldquo;I had $65 to my name. I spent $49 on Guru A&rsquo;s service. &nbsp;My mom, who I was living with, thought I was crazy. &nbsp;I memorized everything in Guru A&rsquo;s book and employed every step in chapters 2-4, verbatim. Two weeks later I was a millionaire. &nbsp;Thank god for Guru A. They changed my life.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">The more details in the testimonial, the greater chance for the Big 4 to be weaved into them.</p>
    <p class="c0">From this example above we can see that the opportunity to follow Guru A is Big, Fast, Easy, Safe, and Anybody could do it.</p>
    <p class="c0">So if you have testimonials, look at the long ones.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a great testimonial we used in Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass:</p>
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image5.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Gathering Testimonials</h2>
    <p class="c0">If you don&rsquo;t have a list of testimonials ready to go, that&rsquo;s okay too.</p>
    <p class="c0">First, think of the perfect story you&rsquo;d want to hear in your testimonial, then ask 3-5 open-ended questions that guide your reader to tell that story.</p>
    <p class="c0">If you want them to say something like:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;I made a ton of money thanks to Guru A in just a couple weeks! I invested in stock xyz as soon as they said to and boom! I made $6,000! I highly recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s a stellar testimonial</p>
    <p class="c0">To get a response like that, you might ask these basic, guided questions:</p>
    <ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_11-0 start">
        <li class="c6 c8">Did you make a lot of money thanks to Guru A?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How much money and how fast did you do it?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">How did you do it?</li>
        <li class="c6 c8">Would you recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c0">Remember, Safe is our big emotion with testimonials&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">So the more specifics you include, the more you talk about how the reader followed the guru&rsquo;s instructions and won, the more real and safe the testimonial will feel.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you are binging copywriting and come to the testimonials section, you can translate the testimonials into useful questions that you can use yourself.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6" id="h.3whwml4">Recap The Offer So Far</h2>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter will have covered a lot of stuff in their offer by this point.</p>
    <p class="c0">And the testimonials will have answered the reader&rsquo;s most pressing questions about whether this could work for them or not&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Which will make the reader feel Safe.</p>
    <p class="c0">So they&rsquo;re excited.</p>
    <p class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s time to make this deal feel larger than life.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can do that quickly with a strong recap section.</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, a recap will be a rapid fire, bullet driven list.</p>
    <p class="c0">Before we talk about what to say, let&rsquo;s talk about what you&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;re communicating that this offer contains an intense amount of value.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s BIG.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">An easy way to execute this is with a price anchor.</p>
    <p class="c0">Before we get to the price anchor, let&rsquo;s look at some recap sections&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s how we did it for a front end product: The Hottest IPO.</p>
    <p class="c0">Notice how we bullet out each piece of our offer and tease a little bit of information&hellip;</p>
    
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image6.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">Also take note of how we total up the values at the end and stack images to make the offer seem BIG!</p>
    <p class="c0">Now take a look at this recap section from The Money Zone, which is a more expensive back end product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image7.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <p class="c0">For the Money Zone sales letter, no price for the product is ever stated in the letter &ndash; so they don&rsquo;t tie values to pieces of the offer on the sales page.</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about a couple ways to set a price anchor.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The Price Anchor</h2>
    <p class="c0">The price anchor is just the psychological starting point for how much an offer is &ldquo;really worth.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Like a negotiation, the higher you can drive this number up at the start, the better.</p>
    <p class="c0">This is really easy to do in a bullet driven recap like we did in The Hottest IPO&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Cover all the things that come standard with the offer.</p>
    <p class="c0">Give each piece its own bullet with a little bit of detail added.</p>
    <p class="c0">In as few words as possible, explain what they can expect and how simple it all is&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Cover all the bonuses offered, and tease some of the information inside.</p>
    <p class="c0">And here&rsquo;s the little trick: Beside each bullet, assign a value.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;My exclusive Pre-IPO Prospectus&hellip;: ($199 Value)&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="c0">When you reach the end of your bullets, you can sum up all of your stuff and say something like, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an $8,414 value!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">That creates what is known as a price anchor.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you can say, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t pay anywhere near that today&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">In fact, you won&rsquo;t even pay HALF that.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can have all this incredible value, $8,414 worth, for just $49.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Which brings me to&hellip;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">A word of caution on your price anchor&hellip;</h2>
    <p class="c0">You may have gotten the sense that $8,414 for just $49 is a little bit of&hellip; well, bullshit.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s over a 99% reduction.</p>
    <p class="c0">Nobody would ever deliver that much value so cheap.</p>
    <p class="c0">And that&rsquo;s a common reaction.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead of just telling you that earlier, I thought I&rsquo;d show you first&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">There is a rule of thumb for your price anchor.</p>
    <p class="c0">Try to keep the anchor from going over 20x the actual price.</p>
    <p class="c0">We broke that rule on The Hottest IPO&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But it will be a lot easier for the reader to accept that your offer of $421 has been reduced down to $49&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Than an offer worth $8,414 being reduced all the way down to $49.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you can reframe this discount and make it BIG, without being ridiculous.</p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><em class="c18">&ldquo;You can have this $421 value for the low, low rate of $49!</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><em class="c18">That&rsquo;s over 80% off the total value! And just a mere 13 cents a day&hellip;</em></p>
    <p class="c0 c-indented"><em class="c18">A price that anyone could afford!&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p class="c0">See how I was able to reframe that a couple different times?</p>
    <p class="c0">As you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, each of these lessons offers you a new tool to build your copywriting fluency.</p>
    <p class="c0">Once you speak the language of copy, and you binge it, it will just make sense to do all these things naturally!</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Comparing Apples to Oranges</h2>
    <p class="c0">Aside from the recap section, another way to offer a price anchor is by comparing apples to oranges.</p>
    <p class="c0">Think of it like comparing a McDonalds cheeseburger to a T-bone steak.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s a Real Example from The Buyout Millionaires Club promo at Agora Financial:</p>

                    <p class="c0">Gains like&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="c0 text-centered"><strong >$27,000, $42,333 and even an extraordinary $95,833 in a Matter of DAYS</strong></p>
                    <p class="c0">How much would that be worth to you? Before you answer, consider this&hellip; </p>
                    <p class="c0">When I used to run a hedge fund&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="c0">We used to charge something called the 2-and-20 fee structure&hellip; </p>
                    <p class="c0">Meaning you are charged a 2% management fee&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="c77">Remember how I said the One-Day Bonus Indicator showed it could deliver average returns totaling</p>
                    <p class="c66">$24,829 every 9 days?</p>
                    <p class="c68">That equates to $1,390,424 a year&hellip; </p>
                    <p class="c68">With gains like that&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="c49">Your fees would easily be over $250,000.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    
    <p class="c0">Before talking about how much a subscription to the newsletter will cost ($2,000)&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriters first mention a cost of $250,000 for Wall Street fees.</p>
    <p class="c0">Apples to oranges.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Offer a Guarantee</h2>
    <p class="c0">When you offer a guarantee, you are simply guaranteeing &ldquo;results.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">And a guarantee does not mean you must give someone their money back.</p>
    <p class="c0">A guarantee can offer anything.</p>
    <p class="c0">Usually, for cheaper front end offers, a money-back guarantee is appropriate.</p>
    <p class="c0">But for very expensive back end offers, where information is the product, a money back guarantee can spell disaster.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because people can buy, download the content, then refund.</p>
    <p class="c0">But, like I said, you can offer a guarantee without offering someone their money back.</p>
    <p class="c0">For a financial copywriting back end, you may see a guarantee like this:</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;We guarantee the chance to see 10x your money or we&rsquo;ll work for free.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="c0">Also of note: these words don&rsquo;t guarantee you &ldquo;will&rdquo; make 10x&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">They guarantee you the &ldquo;chance to see 10x your money.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">This way if the reader never invests a dime, but the guru still does his job of selecting 10x stocks, then the guru doesn&rsquo;t owe the reader anything further.</p>
    <p class="c0">Whether the readers invest in the guru&rsquo;s recommendations or not is their choice.</p>
    <p class="c0">Next, let&rsquo;s look at the words: &ldquo;work for free.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Generally, the guarantee is backed by a second year of the service for free.</p>
    <p class="c0">Meaning, if the service doesn&rsquo;t produce 10x returns in the portfolio, the second year of the service is free.</p>
    <p class="c0">The first reaction everyone ALWAYS has to this guarantee is: &ldquo;Why would I want a free service that didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">That question is tremendously valid&hellip; &nbsp;but apparently inconsequential.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because financial publishers have been running promos with that guarantee for a long, long time with great success&hellip; so&hellip; there&rsquo;s that.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here&rsquo;s our guarantee for The 70 Cent Crypto:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image8.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Limit the Spots or Quantity (Scarcity)</h2>
    <p class="c0">I wrote this entire book and when I reached this point, I admit, I had a mini panic attack.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because I thought I might have completely overlooked a critical fifth pillar to copywriting.</p>
    <p class="c0">And I imagined I would look like a total fool with egg all over my face&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even after saying again and again, &ldquo;All you need is these FOUR things.&rdquo; That potential &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; pillar&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Urgency&hellip; and its alter ego Scarcity.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Urgency/Scarcity &ndash; The FIFTH Pillar of Copywriting?</h2>
    <p class="c0">Oh my GOD! THERE&rsquo;S A FIFTH PILLAR NOW!?</p>
    <p class="c0">Well, luckily, no.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">While it is very powerful, I don&rsquo;t think I would label urgency as fundamental as The Big 4.</p>
    <p class="c0">You see, when you are reading copy, I encourage you to perform active reading&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And dissect every line and try to understand which of The Big 4 the writer was trying to communicate.</p>
    <p class="c0">Because if you can decode copywriting through active reading, you can binge.</p>
    <p class="c0">And if you binge you&rsquo;ll recognize the patterns for how master copywriters communicate The Big 4.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then you will be able to automatically recreate those patterns and communicate exactly what you want with ease.</p>
    <p class="c0">And when looking at urgency, it doesn&rsquo;t fit the bill to join The Big 4.</p>
    <p class="c0">Consider The Big 4 as a healthy, well-balanced, four-course meal&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And urgency is like hot sauce.</p>
    <p class="c0">You splash it in on top.</p>
    <p class="c0">Without The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll go hungry.</p>
    <p class="c0">And without urgency, the meal just isn&rsquo;t as spicy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even with huge portions of just two or three of The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll survive.</p>
    <p class="c0">Let&rsquo;s look at the reverse&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Think how hard a meal of just hot sauce would be to swallow.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s your reader&rsquo;s relationship with urgency.</p>
    <p class="c0">Little doses of urgency here and there go a long way.</p>
    <p class="c0">Except in the &nbsp;offer section.</p>
    <p class="c0">The offer section without urgency would be like a dry chicken wing without any sauce.</p>
    <p class="c0">Follow me?</p>
    <p class="c0">Okay, so I think you get it now.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just remember that urgency is some date or deadline.</p>
    <p class="c0">Some reason to act NOW.</p>
    <p class="c0">(And as such, I think it is probably best categorized under &ldquo;Big&rdquo; instead of given its own pillar)&hellip;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Urgency&rsquo;s Alter Ego is Scarcity</h2>
    <p class="c0">Even though Urgency can&rsquo;t join The Big 4, it does have an alter-ego.</p>
    <p class="c0">Urgency&rsquo;s alter ego is Scarcity.</p>
    <p class="c0">While a deadline limits the time&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Scarcity takes another step and further limits the opportunity&rsquo;s QUANTITY.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Urgency says &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">But Scarcity says, &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip; if you still can.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">It signals to the reader&hellip; Maybe there will still spots available for you.</p>
    <p class="c0">Maybe not.</p>
    <p class="c0">Who knows?</p>
    <p class="c0">Because Scarcity is sort of a one-trick-pony that triggers a sensation of &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; when coupled with Urgency, it is more appropriately filed under New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; than as its own pillar.</p>
    <p class="c0">Urgency and Scarcity are very powerful when wielded properly.</p>
    <p class="c0">And while I think you can use them sparingly to great effect, they have a big role to play in the offer section.</p>
    <p class="c0">Right before asking for the sale, it&rsquo;s very common to see the copywriter limit the spots available and the window of time to get into them.</p>
    <p class="c0">The Money Zone does it right after the guarantee:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image9.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    
    <h2 class="c6">Ask for the Sale</h2>
    <p class="c0">I said &ldquo;ask for the sale&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;close&rdquo; on purpose.</p>
    <p class="c0">Here is a subtle nuance of psychology that most folks don&rsquo;t know about or practice&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">When you close, you want to instruct the reader on what to do&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But you don&rsquo;t want to TELL them what to do.</p>
    <p class="c0">And therein lies the nuance.</p>
    <p class="c0">Instead, you present what is called a &ldquo;Crossroads Close.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Crossroads Close</h2>
    <p class="c0">The crossroads close positions the reader at a crossroads where he must choose a path.</p>
    <p class="c0">The crossroads close will usually go like this&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;You now have two choices.</p>
    <p class="c0">You can choose to join me and make all this money / experience all these incredible benefits&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And have yourself a brand new, incredible life.</p>
    <p class="c0">Or you can click away and go back to the life you&rsquo;ve had before reading this.</p>
    <p class="c0">The life you&rsquo;ve always had.&rdquo; When phrased like that, it sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice.</p>
    <p class="c0">Some folks offer a third choice, &ldquo;try to figure all this stuff out on your own, with no help&hellip; Even though it took me 10 years to figure it out and I&rsquo;m a professional.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">But based on everything I&rsquo;ve seen in psychology papers, it is my opinion that the fewer choices, the better.</p>
    <p class="c0">Why water down the contrast of the two original choices?</p>
    <p class="c0">Anyways, when the reader looks at the original two choices it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice at all.</p>
    <p class="c0">But it still is a choice.</p>
    <p class="c0">That&rsquo;s the subtlety of it.</p>
    <p class="c0">The reader is given the OPTION to be a stubborn ox and say &ldquo;no&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though it makes no logical sense to do so in the context of a crossroad close.</p>
    <p class="c0">But a choice is all the reader wants.</p>
    <p class="c0">Choice = autonomy.</p>
    <p class="c0">The reader is still the master of their own destiny.</p>
    <p class="c0">They know that even if they choose themselves into a pit of despair, they did it their way.</p>
    <p class="c0">Look, nobody likes to be preached at...</p>
    <p class="c0">Nobody likes to be told they must do something or buy something or else they are an idiot&hellip;</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Even though many salesmen take the: &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to be an idiot to say no to this.</p>
    <p class="c0">Don&rsquo;t even think about saying no, you dummy,&rdquo; approach.</p>
    <p class="c0">At the end of the offer section the reader knows they are being sold&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Or they should know by now.</p>
    <p class="c0">They know the Urgency and Scarcity is meant to push them.</p>
    <p class="c0">And they want the freedom of autonomy.</p>
    <p class="c0">The freedom to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">So what does that look like in copy? Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did it:</p>
    
    <p class="c0"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/milligan-imgs/image10.jpg" title=""></p>
    
    <p class="c0">You&rsquo;ll see the writer present the crossroads close.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then tell the reader the decision is totally theirs.</p>
    <p class="c0">Of course while reinforcing how obvious the choice is.</p>
    <p class="c0">Then at this point, the copywriter has done all he can do.</p>
    <p class="c0">The copywriter will quickly sum up the opportunity, the urgency, the scarcity&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">And then leave the reader to their final decision to click or not click.</p>
    <p class="c0">The pitch is over.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just the big, colorful button remains.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">The P.S. and FAQ</h2>
    
    <p class="c0">Personally, I love to summarize the promo in a P.S.</p>
    <p class="c0">directly after the sign off.</p>
    <p class="c0">Sort of like its own abbreviated version of the lead.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Some copywriters like to drop an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) after the sign off.</p>
    <p class="c0">The FAQ basically pulls out each individual objection, or the most common ones, and addresses them directly.</p>
    <p class="c0">I&rsquo;m not a fan of FAQs.</p>
    <p class="c0">For one, it&rsquo;s more work on the copywriter to re-answer questions that should have already been addressed in the copy.</p>
    <p class="c0">Second, there is no flow or conversation control when it comes to an FAQ.</p>
    <p class="c0">The way FAQs are written, question by question&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Allows the reader to freely jump around the page and scan from one question to the next.</p>
    <p class="c0">In phone sales they say you need to control the conversation.</p>
    <p class="c27">An FAQ takes that control away from the copywriter: the seller, who should control the conversation.</p>
    <p class="c27">There is a natural and even forced breakage of attention from one idea to the next in an FAQ section.</p>
    <p class="c27">And the inevitable repeating of information the reader has &ldquo;already seen before.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">What&rsquo;s the point of writing a coherent, story-driven, sales letter that &ldquo;shows&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tells&hellip;&rdquo; Just to make a list that tells after it&rsquo;s all over?</p>
    <p class="c0">Sure, the copywriter can weave sales messages into FAQ&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.2bn6wsx">And I know of very successful sales letters with immense FAQ sections (Jim Rickards&rsquo; IMPACT System jumps into mind)&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But personally, I&rsquo;m not a fan.</p>
    <p class="c0">Just write compelling copy and the FAQ becomes unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="c0">You are free to write one if you want&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Completely your choice.</p>
    
    <h2 class="c6">Wrapping Up The Offer Section</h2>
    <p class="c0">The offer section is chock full of important information.</p>
    <p class="c0">I hope you noticed from the examples I&rsquo;ve presented&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">And the lessons I&rsquo;ve established early and often in this guide&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">That you must remember to keep The Big 4 top of mind in everything you write.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though it might seem like your reader &ldquo;just wants the information&hellip;&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get caught in that trap.</p>
    
    <p class="c0">Especially when you&rsquo;re this close to the end.</p>
    <p class="c0">Even though I have offered some form of structure for your offer section, keep the elements within unique.</p>
    <p class="c0">Remember, categorization = DEATH.</p>
    <p class="c0">&ldquo;New and novel&rdquo; is not just for your headline.</p>
    <p class="c0">It&rsquo;s not just for your lead.</p>
    <p class="c0">It applies to your body copy, and even your offer copy.</p>
    
    <h1 class="c6">Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="c0">You now have the fundamentals to dissect and translate virtually any piece of copywriting or sales material you come across.</p>
    <p class="c0">You might be looking at shorter copywriting&hellip; </p>
    <p class="c0">Facebook ads&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.qsh70q">Or emails&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">Or you may be observing a live webinar that you can&rsquo;t read&hellip;</p>
    <p class="c0">But these lessons should jump out at you anywhere anything is being sold.</p>
    <p class="c0">The world should not look the same to you from here on.</p>
    <p class="c0">Finishing this guide and finally closing it should feel like an awakening.</p>
    <p class="c0" id="h.3as4poj">You can now &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">If the world doesn&rsquo;t look a little different, this guide did a poor job or you didn&rsquo;t need it.</p>
    <p class="c0">You now understand that copywriting is not a &ldquo;how to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="c0">It is a language, purely communicated through subtext.</p>
