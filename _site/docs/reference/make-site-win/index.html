            <p class="calibre4">Over the past twelve years, CRE has worked in over eighty&nbsp;different verticals, in thirty-seven&nbsp;countries, and in eleven&nbsp;languages, helping to optimize the profits of some of the webâs most sophisticated companies, including</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="calibre4">CRE increases the profits of businesses scientifically by analyzing their websitesâ visitors, creating optimized pages and then A/B testing them to measure the increase in sales. It has generated billions in revenue for its clients and double- and triple-digit improvements are the norm.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">CRE is the recipient of a Queenâs Award for Enterprise for Outstanding Achievement in Innovation, the UKâs top award for businesses. The award was given for CREâs work codifying the methodology that the worldâs leading companies now use to improve their websites.</p>

          <strong class="calibre2">Foreword</strong> by Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist, Google
        
        
      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">If you ask âwhy experimentâ to people who live and champion experimentation, theyâll answer that it allows decisions to be based on data. This is true.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Or, they may tell you that it allows you to get answers fast, without needing to have long debates with your team. This is also true.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Or, youâll hear that, because one never knows exactly who the visitor is, it is difficult to anticipate the visitorsâ expectations&mdash;and hence why not let an n-variable multivariate experiment figure out the best solution for each type of visitor. This is especially true.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Or, youâll hear a string of explanations around statistics, confidence intervals, and significance&mdash;that a business should be improved with the same discipline and control that would be applied to most feats of manufacturing and engineering. I like this; why not overcome all human barriers via brute force math! :-)</p>
            <p class="calibre4">The above reasons are certainly exciting and contribute to why I champion experimentation. They are not at the core, though.</p>
            <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">I see experimentation as a solution to a set of pernicious problems with business culture.</em> I am heartbroken about the power dynamic in most organizations, where decisions are based not on customer needs but the opinions of the person with the most senior job title. (In a speech in 2006, I framed this as HiPPO-driven decision-making&mdash;HiPPO standing for the Highest Paid Personâs Opinion.) Experimentation reduces that power dynamic with amazing results.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">In addition, I deeply believe in <a href="http://crelink.co/mww423" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">heuristic evaluations</span></a>, in which a broad cross section of company employees use a website or mobile app as customers. Heuristic evaluations create a democracy of ideas, capturing insights from beyond the User Experience team and Digital team. The only way to allow this democracy to thrive is to build an experimentation model&mdash;to put all the ideas through testing.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">In my experience, most companies operate as if the world is static. As if tastes donât change, preferences donât evolve, and disruptive competitors donât show up. In reality, <em class="calibre6">change is the only constant</em>. Experimentation assumes this is true and fosters a culture of mental agility that constantly explores boundaries (and pushes against them).</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Finally, most people and companies are risk-averse. What I love the most about experimentation is that it allows us to accommodate for the short-term risk we are willing to tolerate. You may be deeply shy, your company may be a cash cow, and even the slightest change to the ecosystem may mean death, but thatâs no problem. Experimentation allows you to dial-in the level of risk you want to take (you may even choose to show a test to only a small fraction of your visitors). On the other hand, if you realize that taking bold risks is the only way to protect your confident position in the market, then experimentation allows you to execute precisely that&mdash;to learn and keep kicking butt!</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Itâs about leveraging experimentation to influence a shift in culture, as we all know <em class="calibre6">culture eats strategy for breakfast</em>.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">That is the reason you should buy this lovingly crafted book. The deep and broad digital experience Karl and Ben have accumulated in their years of practice is reflected in every chapter.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">The book is broken into easily digestible chunks. Section One is best shared with every boss who stands in your way. Section Two will help you quickly set up the foundations on which your ideas democracy can flower. Section Three will give you a lifetime of ideas that will fuel the fundamental shift you are trying to accomplish.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">If you are standing in a bookstore wondering if you want to buy this book, jump to the section about how âWinning websitesâ¦manage complexityâ and scan Step&nbsp;7. Then rush to the cashier to check out.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">A culture of experimentation has benefits that far surpass âthis button is better than thatâ or âthis offer is better than that.â</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Solve for culture and your career will never be the same again.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Carpe diem!</p>

          Why this is <strong class="calibre2">the only book of its kind</strong> (and why its techniques will transform your website, your business and your career, like they have ours)
        
        
      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Most websites lose.</strong> Almost all of them.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Many of them never make a profit. Like chocolate teapots, they look nice but flop as soon as you pour hot customers into them.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Others are successful at first, and then get pushed out of business by their competitors.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">This book is about how to buck the trend, to make websites that customers love and that are outrageously profitable.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">It has the ability to transform your business and your career. Really. Thatâs an extraordinary claim&mdash;and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">So here goes:</p>
            <section id="calibre_link-160" class="level" data-number="4.1.1">
    
      <h3 data-number="4.1.1" class="calibre16">
        
        
          1. This book is based on experimentally proven facts&mdash;not theory
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Have you ever looked at a companyâs marketing materials and wondered, âDoes this really make people buy?â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We have. And in 2005, we began a quest to find out for certain.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">One of us, Ben, was running the website for a company that sold phones for travelers. The other, Karl, was a Cambridge PhD scientist. Together, we discussed how weâd be able to carry out scientific experiments on the website.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Weâd change a page and then measure&mdash;via an A/B test&mdash;whether our new version had increased (or decreased) the companyâs sales.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The results were astonishing. Within a year, we managed to triple&mdash;to $9 million&mdash;the sales of the company&mdash;even though the worldwide demand for travel phones was decreasing by 15% per year.</p>
                <section id="calibre_link-161" class="level" data-number="4.1.1.0.1">
                    <p class="img"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/mww-images/000022.jpg" class="calibre17" /></p>
                </section>
                <section id="calibre_link-162" class="level" data-number="4.1.1.0.2">
                    <p class="img1">Sales went through the roof the first time we applied A/B testing to a company. Rather than rescaling the axes, we drew on the wall, hoping to penetrate the ceiling tiles. (Those dashed lines represent interim forecasts we kept beating.)</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">In doing so, we began to build a database of what works (and what doesnât).</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Since then, we have applied the same methodology to hundreds of companies. Double- and triple-digit improvements have been the norm, and many of the companies have won awards for fast growth. With each success (and failure), we update our database of what works. And each time an activity turns out to be fruitful (or fruitless), we adjust our methodology accordingly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">In this book, we have distilled many of the most successful ones&mdash;the activities and strategies that most reliably grow a business.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Itâs exciting to have the power to walk into any business and be able to permanently, dramatically, and measurably grow its sales&mdash;all without having to leave the building. Most salespeople dream of being able to do that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">You see, the majority of web design and copywriting is still in the pre-scientific age. The average webpage was designed less scientifically than the average toilet brush. Most web designers rely on inspiration, not experimentation. They are oblivious to what works and what doesnât. They violate proven principles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">By the time you finish this book, youâll know what works in web design. Youâll know how to write copy that works. And youâll be able to easily spot the mistakes in any webpage&mdash;or, indeed, in any marketing materials.</p>

          2. The techniques in this book are teachable
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">On the strength of our success with the travel phone company, we published an article about the approach we had developed. It immediately went viral. That week, according to the statistics service Alexa.com, our website was the third fastest growing in the world.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The following day, we received an email out of the blue from one of Googleâs senior managers, who invited us to become the first worldwide consulting partner for Googleâs testing tool.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">And so our company, Conversion Rate Experts, was born.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">At the time, hardly anyone was doing this type of marketing. (We even gave it a name: conversion rate optimization, or CRO.)</p>
                <p class="calibre4">As we grew, we hired new team members. We discovered that the most successful ones were readers of our blog. So we continued to publish valuable articles with the ulterior motive that each one attracted both clients and new team members.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Plus, every time we published an article, we received emails from people telling us how it had helped them to grow their businesses.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This book is a compilation of the most useful of those articles. For the first time, they are organized in an order that allows you to quickly become great at conversion. Importantly, the book teaches you the right <em class="calibre6">mental models</em>, so your understanding of conversion will be deep and intuitive.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Of course, thereâs a limit to what a book can achieve. A book about songwriting wonât turn you into Paul McCartney, and a book about CRO&mdash;even a dense one like this&mdash;wonât make you great at conversion overnight. However, it does contain ample information to generate millions for a company.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The best conversion practitioners are like sponges, obsessed with learning. (Which, come to think of it, sponges arenât. Who came up with that analogy?)</p>

          4. What you will&mdash;and wonât&mdash;get from this book (this book focuses on <em class="calibre6">improving websites</em>&mdash;because thatâs what the most successful web businesses do)
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">In the 1990s, websites were designed for designers</strong>, whose goals were typically (1)&nbsp;to use the project as an opportunity to learn the technologies (Flash, XML, CSS, and others) and (2)&nbsp;to populate their portfolios to show off their newfound capabilities. It wasnât uncommon for a website to be impossibly difficult to use.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">In 2000, websites were designed for search engines.</strong> To get traffic from search engines, webmasters obsessed over search engine optimization (SEO), making websites âsearch engine friendly.â Unfortunately, the search engines, which were still primitive, accidentally rewarded some practices that were very user-unfriendly, including pages that were stuffed with keywords to the point of being illegible, light gray text on a white background, and âlinks pagesâ with endless reciprocal links.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">In 2010, websites were designed for companies.</strong> Search engines had become less trickable, and so agencies became free to focus on what their clients wanted. And what did the clients want? Well, some of them wanted quirky diagonal navigation bars, some wanted parallax scrolling, and some wanted spinny icons. Others wanted best practices, crammed with marketing techniques and things âborrowedâ from competitors. They wanted the kind of thing you see when you browse galleries of website themes.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">And thatâs where we are today.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">However, throughout that period, there were a small number of companies that <em class="calibre6">didnât</em> follow those trends. <strong class="calibre2">These companies, the most successful websites, focused on their customers.</strong> Customer-centric design was&mdash;and still is&mdash;surprisingly rare. The websites look nothing like the ones you see in theme galleries. Customers like them, they visit them often, and they spend a lot. Customer-centric, customer-optimized websites are winning. They are the subject of this book.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If you study any one of the winning websites, youâll find they are built of âenginesâ of conversion, of perfected landing pages and irresistible offers, of compelling copy and user-friendly interfaces, of viral loops and streamlined order flows. And if you visit the companies themselves, youâll find that their team members are engineers finely tuning those conversion engines.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Web companies that are struggling, on the other hand, tend to focus on different things. Some of them spend their time on brute-force SEO. Others prioritize pretty web design. Many donât ever change their websites, because they have created knots of complexity that they <em class="calibre6">canât</em> change. Of course, those disciplines, and many others, are important. But we find that they become easy when you have created a high-converting website.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So, important as they are, this book will not address many aspects of web design and marketing. Youâll need a different book if you want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO, or advertising. In this book, we encourage you to focus on whatâs essential: Creating pages that visitors love and that convert like crazy. If coding is an obstacle for you, you can get great results using this bookâs methodology with a website builder tool like <a href="http://crelink.co/mww408" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">SquareSpace</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww409" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Wix</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww410" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Shopify</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww411" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">BigCommerce</span></a> (a former client of ours), <a href="https://webflow.com/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">WebFlow</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww412" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">LeadPages</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww413" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Unbounce</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww414" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">ClickFunnels</span></a>, or <a href="http://crelink.co/mww415" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">PageWiz</span></a>. Then, imagine how easy it is to get visitors once you have created a website that people love and that has a huge lifetime customer value. Advertising becomes simple when you can afford to outbid all the competition. SEO is a piece of cake when you have a website that people <em class="calibre6">want</em> to link to.</p>

          5. This book works even on the most sophisticated companies
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Our clients include many of the worldâs most sophisticated web companies. In fact, we believe we have designed pages for more top 500 websites than any other company. This has been both a privilege and a curse. We have been fortunate enough to work with some of the worldâs best marketers, and we have had to improve upon some of the worldâs most difficult-to-beat pages.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">As such, our methodology has had a trial by fire.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We once read an article called something like â100 must-have web analytics reports.â Anyone whoâs familiar with the Pareto principle will know that there arenât 100 must-have anythings. At the end of a project, we ask ourselves the following question: âIf we had to repeat that project in one-tenth of the time, what were the vital few activities that were most fruitful? What could we do differently next time?â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This book is about the vital few.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Even though this book is about optimizing webpages, itâs equally applicable to any content that is important enough to be hyperoptimized.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The techniques can be applied with great success to almost any media, provided itâs important enough to be worth making great. Weâve used it successfully on press releases, marketing email sequences, video scripts, webinars, print ads, Facebook ads, and much more. Weâll use it on whatever media arise next.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">In the rest of this section (âWhy Most Web Design Is Done Wrong&mdash;and How to Do It Like the Winnersâ), we define what conversion entails (when itâs done right). We explain why it should be the number-one priority for your company (and for your career)&mdash;as it is for the worldâs most successful web companies. We describe The Power Law of CRO and how it can drive a company into an economic âvirtuous circleâ of growth. This will help you to win the support and enthusiasm of your colleagues.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We also point out the conversion principles that are followed by the top web companies&mdash;the winners&mdash;and that are strikingly absent from most other web companies.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Most people do CRO the wrong way round. They behave like physicians prescribing remedies before having diagnosed the patient. These âmalpracticing physicians of marketingâ prescribe testimonials, guarantees, and punchy headlines&mdash;and have no idea why the visitors arenât taking action. We introduce our customer-centric DiPS (Diagnose â Problem â Solution) approach, which thrashes the alternative&mdash;as youâd expect, given that the alternative is so absurd.</p>

To overextend the medical analogy, these are the web stethoscopes, landing page thermometers, and the homepage ear-microscope doodads. These techniques will allow you to deeply understand your visitors&mdash;and how they interact with your website. That way, youâll empathically understand them, and youâll be able to identify exactly why they arenât converting into customers.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">Fortunately, there arenât an infinite number of reasons why visitors donât convert. In fact, our research has revealed that most websites underperform in just fourteen ways. In Section 3, (âMaking Websites Win: The Most Common Problems That Make Web Visitors Abandon&mdash;And Proven, Easy-To-Implement Solutionsâ) we devote a chapter to each of them. In each chapter, we describe the most effective techniques for getting your website âfiring on all fourteen cylinders.â</p>

We reveal exactly how the steps were carried out, so you can see how the principles and techniques described above come together in practice&mdash;with record-breaking results.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Okay, thatâs enough overviewing. Itâs time to explain what conversion entails (when done right), and why it should be the number-one priority for your company&mdash;and for your career.</p>

          What is A/B testing?
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">A/B testing is a powerful way to increase conversion rates. Hereâs how it works:</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If you had two possible headlines for your webpage but couldnât decide which one to use, you could run an A/B test in which</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">half of your visitors would see Headline A, and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">the other half would see Headline B.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">You could then tally the orders for each headline and determine which headline brought you the most.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">A/B testing software makes it easy to carry out such tests. Each of your visitors will see a different version of the page&mdash;Version A or Version B, or even Version C, D, or E&mdash;and then the software will work out, on average, which of the elements performed the best. The winner can then be promoted.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">In most tests, Version A is the existing version, often called the âcontrol,â which you are trying to beat.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If we were to use A/B testing software on the following page, we could test the following:</p>

          What is multivariate testing?
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Most A/B testing software also allows you to carry out <em class="calibre6">multivariate tests</em>. What are they?</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Multivariate tests let you effectively carry out several A/B tests concurrently, so you make the most of your traffic. So while you are testing which headline to use, you could also test other page elements&mdash;such as text, images, prices, offers, and buttons&mdash;all at once. Each visitor will see a different combination of headline, text, images, and buttons. Then, once enough data have been collected, the multivariate testing software will tell you which version of each page element, <em class="calibre6">on average</em>, brought in the most customers.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Throughout this book, weâll use âA/B testingâ as a catch-all term to describe A/B testing, multivariate testing, and any other types of scientifically controlled experiments.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">When you A/B test, you get the following benefits:</p>

          Benefit 1. You get to discard your missteps
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Most marketing is based on mere opinions; A/B testing reveals the truth. If a test doesnât produce a winner, you havenât lost a thing; you learn from it and discard the losing variation. You certainly donât keep it, which is what happens in companies that donât test.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">One of our first clients, whose sales we more than tripled, stopped A/B testing after we finished working with it. Its marketing manager then began making radical changes. He persuaded his team that there was no need to A/B test, because the changes were âobviously improvements.â Within a year, the companyâs sales had plummeted, and no one in the company knew why. The marketing manager was fired. Had he A/B tested his changes, he wouldnât have broken the company.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The following story from Microsoftâs Senior Statistician, Roger Longbotham, describes how Microsoft avoided a similar disaster:</p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre22">
                        <p class="calibre4">We ran an experiment for a site where the management was reluctant to run the test because they considered it a âno-brainerâ that the treatment would win. We agreed the value proposition looked quite promising but proceeded with the experiment. The treatment had some unexpected and subtle negative aspects that would not have been detected had we not run the experiment. If the treatment had been launched we estimate the annual loss to the site would have been in the millions of dollars.</p>

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">A/B testing is like a compass: It tells you which direction to move in. One of our clients, a company in the telecom industry, was debating whether to lower the price of its top-selling phone. The phone was already the lowest priced in the marketplace. To measure how price sensitive the companyâs visitors were, we A/B tested the existing price against zero dollars (completely free of charge). To everyoneâs surprise, the zero-dollar offer didnât sell more phones. Our research revealed that users were concerned that the free-phone deal was âtoo good to be true.â Concluding that the visitors werenât sensitive to the price of the handset, we went in the other direction by A/B testing <em class="calibre6">higher</em> prices. The winning page featured two higher-priced premium versions of the phone alongside the standard product. We then obtained a further win by offering optional upsells including accessories, insurance, call credit, and 24-hour customer support. So not only did A/B testing save the company from pointlessly destroying its margins, but it revealed an unexpected opportunity for growing the profits.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Most companies run according to the following process:</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Get Idea â Decide Whether to Implement It â Implement It</em>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">A/B testing allows you to postpone the decision-making until you know the correct answer, at which point the decision is a no-brainer:</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Get Idea â Implement It (as a Test) â Decide Whether to Keep It</em>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">A/B testing thus eradicates the laborious decision-making stage, allowing companies to move faster. Endless pontification about âShould we do it?â is replaced with a simple âLetâs test it and find out!â</p>

                <p class="calibre4">Whichever type of testing you use, the software wonât tell you <em class="calibre6">what</em> to test.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, thatâs the most important part. Roger Longbotham said, âWhat you place upon the statistical framework is what ultimately determines the attractiveness of your test results.â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">As with all tools, A/B testing is subject to the equation âGI&nbsp;â&nbsp;GO,â which stands for âGarbage In leads to Garbage Out.â In other words, if you put garbage into an A/B test, youâll get garbage out of it (albeit optimized garbage).</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The A/B testing software is to CRO what a stopwatch is to a sprinter. The stopwatch doesnât make the sprinter any faster. It just measures the sprinterâs performance, and tells them what is their personal best.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Thatâs where CRO expertise comes into play.

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Back in 2005, when we worked in-house, we tried hard to outsource conversion. It turned out to be impossible. There were many vendors, but each pushed its own solution:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The live chat companies claimed that live chat was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The analytics companies claimed that analytics software was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The usability companies claimed that usability was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The multivariate testing vendors claimed that multivariate testing software was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The copywriters claimed that copywriting was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The eye-tracking companies claimed that eye-tracking was the answer.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">And so on.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">What we wanted was an independent advisor who was effectively a âhubâ for conversion, who had used all of the services, who was completely impartial, and who knew how to get the best results.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We ended up doing it ourselves. As a result, we learned what worked. We now spend all of our time designing pages that convert&mdash;and then we put our necks on the line by insisting that we test our creations, to prove that weâve measurably improved things. Over the past ten years, we have tried an enormous number of techniques, some of which were real gems. We have pulled together the best ones (along with practical, easy ways to get them done) and added many techniques that we developed ourselves. At each stage, we have shared our findings on our blog, which has rewarded us by attracting kindred spirits, people who share our passion. Hopefully, youâll be one of them.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We coined the term <em class="calibre6">conversion rate optimization</em> (CRO) in 2007 to describe this process of pulling together all of the available tools, techniques, and skills&mdash;with the goal of improving a websiteâs conversion rates. CRO takes the guesswork out of creating highly profitable websites. Itâs a series of strategies and activities that allow you to achieve significant increases in profits from your website easily and reliably. User testing and A/B testing software allow you to carry out tests; CRO tells you <em class="calibre6">what</em> to test, by revealing how to create webpages that convert your visitors.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Strictly speaking, CRO is web design done right. Itâs making a page that is perfectly designed to sell, or get sign-ups, or get downloads, or whatever the page is there for. Even ten years later, though, the practice of CRO looks so different from how most web design is carried out that it still warrants having a separate name.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">The effect can be even greater. For some companies, a small increase in conversion rate can mean the difference between suffering a loss and making a profit.</p>

          Benefit 3 (an even more exciting one): CRO opens up floods of traffic
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Once your conversion rate has increased, you're more profitable. It pays to sacrifice some of that profit into increasing your advertising bid prices&mdash;which can dramatically increase your number of customers. You can outbid your competitors and profitably dominate all the advertising space in your market.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Many of our clients find that CRO unlocks marketing opportunities that were previously prohibitively expensive, allowing them to get loads of new customers.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">For startups and small-to-medium sized businesses, CRO is often the catalyst that enables them to start advertising, profitably, in PPC, magazines, newspapers, direct mail, radio, and TV. Clients also become able to pay affiliates more&mdash;which wins the affiliates over from their competitors. The principle even applies to SEO: if a company will generate twice as much revenue from the number-one spot, it can afford to spend twice as much to capture it.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This principle is so extreme that many advertising agencies pay us to work on their clientsâ websites, because they understand that CRO allows their clients to profitably increase their ad spends. With the right combination of CRO and traffic buying, you can displace competitors for good.</p>

          Benefit 1 Ã Benefit 2 Ã Benefit 3 = The Power Law of CRO
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Hereâs the best bit: Benefits 1, 2 and 3 are multiplicative. Which means your profit has a power-law relationship to your conversion rate. (That is, your profit is equal to your conversion rate to the power of something&mdash;maybe squared, cubed, or even more.)</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Looking at the equations from above, you can see why:</p>
                <section id="calibre_link-198" class="level" data-number="4.6.4.0.1">
                    <p class="img"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/mww-images/000113.png" alt="power law of CRO.png" class="calibre17" /></p>

                    <p class="img1">The Power Law of CRO, which explains why so many of our clients have won awards for fast growth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Of course, the multipliers depend on the financials of the business. You can see how your own profits would be affected by an increase in conversion rate by modeling different scenarios in a spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Incredibly, thatâs not the end of it. As the number of orders grows, economies of scale kick in. These further increase the amount you can afford to spend on getting more customers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">CRO is a virtuous circle. The worldâs leading web companies all focus on it&mdash;on user experience, conversion flows, network effects, and customer journeys.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Without doing CRO, itâs impossible to win.</p>

          Why CRO is a great career choice
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">In our experience, the best career strategy is to (1)&nbsp;<strong class="calibre2">Create more value.</strong> CRO allows you to reliably do this, and then (2)&nbsp;<strong class="calibre2">Prove youâve done so.</strong> A/B testing allows you to do this.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">As such, CRO makes for a fantastic career choice. Thereâs a serious shortage of people who have proof that they can grow businesses. Amazingly, most peopleâs rÃ©sumÃ©s have no quantifiable evidence that they have ever created value. Thanks to CRO, many of our clients, followers, and team members have incredibly impressive success stories on their rÃ©sumÃ©s.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Plus, if youâre anything like us, youâll find it endlessly fascinating.</p>

                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15">Aesthetic: Most web agencies design for beauty, paying little more than lip service toward the goals of the business and its customers.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="calibre15">Functional: In our opinion, good web design means understanding your visitors&mdash;and your business&mdash;deeply, then designing to meet both of their needs. And by deeply, we mean not obeying an executive who says, âI know my customers,â but instead gaining deep insights through extensive research.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="calibre4">Which approach is most effective? Take a look at the homepages of <a href="http://crelink.co/mww3" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Google</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww4" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">eBay</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww5" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Amazon</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww6" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Craigslist</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww7" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">LinkedIn</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww8" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Facebook</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww373" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Wikipedia</span></a>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww9" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">YouTube</span></a>, and other leading websites and decide for yourself.

                    <p class="calibre4">It <em class="calibre6">amazes</em> us how few people have noticed this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">To be clear, <strong class="calibre2">itâs fine to optimize for beauty if your insights indicate that your visitors will buy more as a result</strong>. At that point, functional design and aesthetic design become the same thing, and you should test making your website more beautiful. The mistake happens when companies think that pure aesthetics are a substitute for research and testing.</p>

          Why not design for function <em class="calibre6">and</em> aesthetics?
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Some people ask why they shouldnât optimize for function <em class="calibre6">and</em> aesthetics. Even if their visitors are perfectly happy with the current appearance of the website, whatâs the harm in being beautiful regardless?</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Itâs like asking <strong class="calibre2">âWhatâs the harm in giving an Olympic sprinter an egg and spoon to carry while he runs?â</strong> They donât realize that beauty, like an egg and spoon, tends to slow progress to a crawl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">One of our first clients had one of the most beautiful, polished websites we had ever seen. We first noticed a problem when we asked the head developer to italicize a particular word. âThatâs not just a fifteen-minute job,â he replied, âIt will have to wait till next week.â We were amazed. We had just come from working in-house, where we had tripled our employerâs sales in twelve months. We were used to making changes quickly. Putting a word into italics would have taken us sixty seconds. We had taken that agility for granted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Imagine if your website were as easy to edit as Wikipedia, Google Docs, or Justin Jacksonâs article <a href="http://crelink.co/mww10" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">âThis Is a Web Pageâ</span></a> (which we urge you to read). How much more work would you get done? How quickly could you iterate? Typical web marketers could edit a Wikipedia page in one minute, but would take at least a day to make a similar change to their own website. Thatâs over a thousand times longer. Much of that time difference is because their own website is more complicated for aesthetic reasons: Fonts are substituted, decorative images are included, layouts are complicated, and ornamental graphics are added. The technical burden soon becomes immense: changes must be checked on multiple devices running multiple browsers on multiple operating systems; plug-ins conflict; fonts donât renderâ¦</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">â¦and before long, youâre no longer outraged that it takes seven days&mdash;seven days!&mdash;to turn a word into italics.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Facebook has pushed live several <em class="calibre6">thousand</em> more changes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If your website is already more beautiful than Amazonâs, and your customers are happy with its appearance, are you sure that the best way to grow your business is to make it more beautiful&mdash;or have you just run out of ideas? Beauty can lead to sluggishness, and sluggishness can lead to economic death.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If you do make your website more beautiful, ensure your designs are minimalist&mdash;visually and technically. Keep them elegantly simple and easy to update. And donât forget that&mdash;like the Stanley hammer&mdash;good functional design has a beauty of its own.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">When top companies change their websites, they measure the effects of the changes, using A/B testing software or some other type of experimental technique. We have already described the benefits of A/B testing. The following quotes may be useful if youâre trying to persuade your company to adopt a culture of testing:</p>

                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">If you are a marketer or designer</strong>, ensure that you follow the three success principles: Design pages that fulfill their primary purpose, measure and test everything you create, and minimize your work-in-progress.

Pushing conversion knowledge upon someone is futile unless they are hungry for it. By setting the ârules of the gameâ (insisting that your team follows the three principles), you align their goals with those of your business, and your team will devour any information that will be useful to them.

Be the child who dares to tell the emperor that heâs wearing no clothes (and is carrying an egg and spoon). You donât need to have a scientific background&mdash;you just need to have the diligence and discipline to follow the principles. And when you encounter people who dare to follow the principles of Scientific Web Design, encourage and support them. They havenât chosen the easy path.</p>

            <p class="calibre4">Just because your changes are going to be incremental and frequent doesnât mean they should be minor or trivial. In fact, the biggest mistake people make when optimizing their websites is what we call âmeek tweaking.â They set up A/B testing software, then they make daft changes. They change button colors and shuffle items around the page, just because they read that it worked for someone else. They do the Garbage In â Garbage Out thing.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">The curved line shows how long it will take for an A/B test to reach completion. Itâs for a page that gets 300 views/day (thatâs about 9,000 views/month). The shape of the curve would be similar (just higher or lower) for other traffic volumes.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Imagine that you have just designed a new version of such a page, and your new version has an <strong class="calibre2">80% higher</strong> conversion rate than the existing version. As you can see in the graph, the time taken to detect that improvement would be just <strong class="calibre2">two days</strong>.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Whereas if your new version was only <strong class="calibre2">20% better</strong> than the existing page, the A/B test would take <strong class="calibre2">twenty-three days</strong> to reach completion.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">In other words, <strong class="calibre2">to detect an improvement thatâs a quarter as large</strong> (20% compared with 80%), <strong class="calibre2">then your A/B test would take over <em class="calibre6">ten times</em> as long</strong> (twenty-three days compared with two days).</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If you were looking to detect <strong class="calibre2">an improvement of only 10%</strong>, then the A/B test would take <strong class="calibre2">several <em class="calibre6">months</em></strong> to conclude.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The moral of the story is that <strong class="calibre2">small improvements take ages to detect</strong>, disproportionately and counterintuitively so.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So you should <strong class="calibre2">aim for bold, targeted changes</strong>, for the following reasons:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Each change gets you more profit</strong> (an 80% improvement gives four times the benefit of a 20% improvement, obviously).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Itâs more fun and interesting.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Itâs <em class="calibre6">much</em> quicker.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">Whereas if youâre doing what we call <em class="calibre6">meek tweaking</em>&mdash;making small, arbitrary changes, then your project suffers:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">

                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">This becomes <strong class="calibre2">disheartening</strong>, and you lose motivation.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">Most marketers do things to their websites that theyâd never do to their bodies.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">The most common causes of death in people are heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory infection, diabetes, and dementia. However, on seeing that list, only a fool would rush to a pharmacy and start taking medication against all of those ailments, wolfing down pills for diseases they donât have. Such behavior would cause more harm than good. Instead, sensibly, when someone is ill, they go to a physician who first diagnoses whatâs wrong and only then prescribes the most relevant remedy.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">That may sound obvious for health, but itâs not what people do with their websites. Most web marketers run straight to the âmarketing pharmacyâ and cram their webpages with every possible remedy. Then they wonder why they have a website thatâs cluttered and converts no better&mdash;or even worse&mdash;than the previous version. Itâs marketing malpractice. Their visitors had specific objections, but instead of overcoming those objections, the marketers filled their pages with irrelevant distractions. They should be struck off.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Your visitorsâ attention is limited. You must treat it preciously.</p>

          DiPS: A formula for success
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">The following approach to conversion is <em class="calibre6">much</em> more effective than the one described above. We call it Diagnose&ndash;Problem&ndash;Solution (DiPS for short). DiPS is the web-marketing equivalent of the physician doing tests to diagnose what is wrong, then analyzing the test data to identify the problem, and then coming up with an appropriate solution.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">To implement DiPS, you first need to carry out research to diagnose your websiteâs problems. Youâll need to understand a lot about your visitors and how they interact with your website.</p>

          Conversion solutions are highly targeted; the problems are like locks&mdash;the solutions like keys
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Hereâs an example to illustrate why DiPS is so effective. And why the alternative&mdash;blindly applying best practices&mdash;is so ineffective.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Imagine that a company, ABC Corps, had just launched a new product, the ABCmatic.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Would you buy one? Probably not, for one of the following reasons:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You donât know <strong class="calibre2">what it does</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You know what it does, but you donât know <strong class="calibre2">why youâd need one</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You arenât convinced that <strong class="calibre2">it will do what it claims to do</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You donât know whether itâs <strong class="calibre2">compatible with your existing technology</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You think itâs <strong class="calibre2">too expensive</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You <strong class="calibre2">donât trust the company</strong>. Youâve never heard of them before.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You are <strong class="calibre2">going to think about it</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">If you donât know what the ABCmatic does, ABC Corps would have to explain what it does. Would a guarantee help instead? No. Would a lower price help instead? Not at all. Would testimonials help? No. None of those things would help one iota. The <em class="calibre6">only</em> thing that could advance your decision is an explanation of what the ABCmatic does&mdash;such as âABCmatic allows you to manage your computerâs memory.â In fact, all those other solutions would merely reduce the chance that youâd ever find the paragraph that explains what the product does. The problem is like a lock, and the solution is like a key.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Now, imagine that you understand what the ABCmatic does, but canât understand why that would benefit you. Would a guarantee help? No! Would a lower price help? No! Would a price discount help? No! The only thing that would advance your decision is an explanation of how the features relate to benefits that you care about&mdash;such as an explanation that âThe ABCmatic helps to clear your computerâs memory cache, so your computer runs up to twice as fast.â That would do the job. Nothing else would.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">And so, <strong class="calibre2">for each objection, you need to display a clear counterobjection.</strong></p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If visitors donât know <strong class="calibre2">what it does</strong>, then <strong class="calibre2">explain what it does</strong>.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">

                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If visitors donât know whether itâs <strong class="calibre2">compatible with your existing technology</strong>, then <strong class="calibre2">explain the compatibility details</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If visitors think itâs <strong class="calibre2">too expensive,</strong> then <strong class="calibre2">justify the price</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If visitors <strong class="calibre2">donât trust the company</strong>, then <strong class="calibre2">show evidence that the company is trustworthy</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If visitors are <strong class="calibre2">going to think about it</strong>, then <strong class="calibre2">provide reasons to act promptly</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">Itâs the same with every single page element on a website. Every image, every word has a very specific purpose&mdash;usually to create a thought in the visitorsâ minds that will move them closer to taking action. Guarantees, for example, are mechanisms that have two very specific functions: to reduce risk and to demonstrate that the company is confident in its claims. So guarantees work only when risk and proof are issues. In other situations, they make no difference. <em class="calibre6">Negative headlines</em> are another example of a mechanism. Negative headlines (such as â7 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a CRMâ) work when the visitors have decided that theyâll do something (in this case, choose a CRM) and their main thought is âHow can I avoid making the wrong decision?â In such cases, negative headlines work great; otherwise, they donât.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Most marketers know some conversion mechanisms, but few understand each mechanismâs function. So they litter pages with âbest practicesâ&mdash;a practice thatâs far from best.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The best marketers create funnels that counter each objection at the exact moment that the visitors think about it. And the only way to do that is to understand the visitors well.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The best marketers find out&mdash;not guess&mdash;exactly why their visitors arenât currently converting.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If only there were some great techniques for finding outâ¦</p>

          Why it pays to <strong class="calibre2">understand your visitors</strong>
        
        
      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">Itâs hard to delight people if you donât know them.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Winning web businesses understand their customers better than their competitors do.</p>
            <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Fortune</em> magazine described our approach as âa combination of multivariate statistical analysis and good old-fashioned detective work.â This section is about the detective work.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">So what do you need to know about your visitors? You need to knowâ¦</p>
            <ul class="calibre13">
                <li class="calibre14">
                    <p class="calibre15">what makes them tick;</p>
                </li>
                <li class="calibre14">
                    <p class="calibre15">what stops them from ticking more often;</p>
                </li>
                <li class="calibre14">
                    <p class="calibre15">how you can increase their dollars-per-tick (we might be straining the âtickâ analogy here).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="calibre4">At the very least, you need to understand why most of them leave without buying.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, those nonconverting visitors come and go without a trace. How can you find out what they wanted? How do you know what would have persuaded them to take action?</p>
            <p class="calibre4">If you owned a real-life bricks-and-mortar store, this would be easy: Youâd hear their objections. Youâd be able to ask questions. Youâd hear what they muttered as they headed for the door.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Capturing the voice of the customer is more difficult on the web, but it can be done. Itâs what our Research Department does every day. Over the past ten years, we have carried out research for hundreds of companies. We have used every type of tool. (We often use whichever tools our clients are already using, so we are forced to know them all.)</p>
            <p class="calibre4">We are also constantly testing out new ways of using the tools. Whatâs the best question to ask visitors when they exit a page? And how do you word that question to get the highest response rate?</p>
            <p class="calibre4">We know it, weâve tested it, and in this section we share all the details. We will describe the tools and techniques that we have found to be the most useful&mdash;those that generate the most âinsights per minute.â Each technique provides insight into a different aspect of your visitorsâ behavior&mdash;including what the visitors want, what they like, how they make decisions, and what they donât like. Together, they create a clear picture of how you can improve your websiteâs performance and profits.</p>

                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Problem 1: How can you understand your visitors?</strong> For example, how can you find out whatâs stopping them from taking action? Itâs not easy when there arenât many of them to ask. Tumbleweed canât tell you how it feels.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Problem 2: How can you measure what works?</strong> High-traffic websites rely on A/B tests to measure whether their changes make a statistically significant difference. But A/B tests often donât reach significance when there isnât enough traffic.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If youâre feeling overwhelmed, take heart in the knowledge that every successful company has had to pass through this stage at one point.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Weâll tackle the first of those problems now. Weâll address Problem 2 later, in the chapter on A/B testing.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">Some of the techniques we mention in this section rely upon a website getting lots of traffic. Some surveys, for example, typically get a completion rate of 3%. If your business is small, we recommend that you <strong class="calibre2">make the most of the following techniques, which can be carried out even if your website gets just a few visitors per day</strong>. Each of them is described in detail in the following chapters<strong class="calibre2">:</strong></p>

Ask a friend&mdash;or anyone you can get your hands on&mdash;to participate. Once your website is refined enough, aim to user test it on people who are from your target demographic and psychographic.</p>

          Itâs easier to learn CRO by working on high-traffic websites
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Low-traffic websites arenât the best places to learn the craft of CRO; itâs easier to learn by working on websites that get lots of traffic.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So, if you want to become world-class at CRO, you would benefit from finding an opportunity to work on a high-traffic website. If the low-traffic website in question is yours, and you canât afford to take a sabbatical working on a high-traffic website, then you may want to hire someone who has.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">With high-traffic websites, you get exposed to fire hoses of feedback. Feedback fire hoses are valuable for two reasons. In the short term, they allow you to iterate and improve what youâre working on. But they also hone your craft. The top performers in many fields of endeavor are those who have, at some point in their careers, been exposed to fire hoses of feedback. Most successful movie comedians, for example, developed their comedy intuition by performing night after night in front of live audiences, getting instant feedback on every word, movement, and gesture they made. Most successful bands began their careers playing in front of live audiences, learning&mdash;on a second-by-second basis&mdash;what audiences liked and disliked. So if you want to become great at conversion, seek opportunities to work on high-traffic websites. Ideally, you want to work in a company thatâs big enough to have loads of traffic and agile enough to allow you to move fast. In doing so, youâll quickly develop a knack of knowing what will convert&mdash;and what wonât.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Then, when youâve learned the craft, youâll find it much easier to grow a low-traffic website.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Right, on to the techniquesâ¦</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">Web analytics software gives you details about the visitors to your website&mdash;where they came from, and which links they clicked on once they arrived. Itâs essential for CRO, but it tells only a small part of the story. Itâs like the closed-circuit TV cameras in a supermarket. They give an aerial view of where visitors entered the store, but they donât reveal <em class="calibre6">why</em> the visitors came. They show the path that visitors took through the store, but they donât reveal what the visitors were thinking. They show you exactly where and when the visitors left the store, but not why. Or what to do about it. For that, youâll need qualitative tools, which are described later.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Youâll find web analytics most useful in the early stages of a project, when you are seeking to identify on which pages to start work. It will also inform the pages on which you should implement the tools described in the rest of the chapters in this section. If a page gets no visitors, then changing it will have no effect. Nor will changing a page that already has a 100% conversion rate. Web analytics software will help you to identify the arteries of the website&mdash;the high-traffic flows that lead to successful conversions. Along with other tools, it can also help you to spot the aspects of those flows that are currently underperforming.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">Whereas web analytics software tells you what links your visitors click on, click-mapping software shows you which parts of your pages your visitors click on. Thereâs a subtle difference: click-mapping software shows you clicks even if they werenât on a link. This information is displayed as a âheat map,â like this:</p>
            <section id="calibre_link-226" class="level" data-number="5.6.0.0.1">
                <p class="img"><img alt="" src="../../../assets/images/mww-images/000117.jpg" class="calibre17" /></p>

                <p class="calibre4">Click-mapping offers several advantages:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">It will reveal <strong class="calibre2">things that are getting clicked but are not clickable</strong>. Youâll discover that visitors are clicking on parts of the page that arenât links but perhaps should be. For example, if you discover visitors are clicking on a product photo, you may choose to allow the picture to be magnified, or you may decide readers want to read more information about it. Similarly, they may wrongly believe that a particular graphic is navigation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">It will also reveal, at a glance, <strong class="calibre2">which parts of the page are getting the most attention</strong>. This can be particularly useful when youâre showing the data to people who arenât experienced in web analytics.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">If several of the links on your page lead to the same URL&mdash;for example, if there are three links to a particular product page&mdash;click-mapping will show you <strong class="calibre2">which of the links your visitors clicked on</strong>. This is technically possible with analytics, but requires some set-up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Have you ever wondered <strong class="calibre2">how far visitors scroll down your pages</strong>? Many click-mapping tools can give you the answer, in the form of easy-to-interpret scroll maps. If some of your pages are long, scroll maps can reveal which parts of the page get the most attention (based on the average viewing time). This can be great for identifying which parts of your page are most important to your visitors. If one of your pages has a âfalse bottomâ&mdash;a gap in the design that appears to visitors to be the bottom of the page&mdash;then a scroll map will reveal that visitors arenât scrolling. (You then need to work out whether thatâs because <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/scrolling-tips/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">they didnât realize that the page could be scrolled</span></a>, or because they werenât interested enough to scroll.)</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">We recommend you study click-mapping reports of your most important pages (in terms of revenue and traffic) and of any pages you feel may have usability issues.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Of course, most heat maps show many things that are predictable, but thatâs not why you should use heat maps. Ignore the predictable heat and look for the anomalies.</p>

          The answer to this one question could skyrocket your sales
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">We have devised one question thatâs incredibly useful. In fact, it almost always reveals an easy way to increase a companyâs sales. It works like magic on any business&mdash;online or offline.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We arrived at it after seeing a TV program about a military assault course&mdash;a series of rope swings, climbing nets, and muddy pools. The TV presenter was interviewing people who had just finished the course, asking them what had been the worst obstacle. Several of the finishers mentioned a tall wall that had been tough to climb. The scene then cut to a view of that wall, revealing that, sure enough, many people were still stuck behind the wall. After several attempts at climbing it, they were giving up and dropping out.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We wondered how we could adapt that question to sales processes, to identify the conceptual âwallsâ that prevent prospects from buying.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We devised the question, asked it of our clientsâ customers, and discovered that it has an incredible ability to identify obstacles&mdash;and hence opportunities for growth. The question is so valuable, it deserves its own page (but itâs not getting one). The question isâ¦rabba dabba dabba (this is supposed to be a drum roll) dabba dabba dabbaâ¦TISH!: <strong class="calibre2">âWhat nearly stopped you buying from us?â</strong></p>
                <p class="calibre4">The wording can be modified depending on what your company does. It could also end with âfrom using usâ or âfrom signing up.â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">You can also ask the question in many ways. For example, you can use a survey on your websiteâs thank-you page or even email the customer a link to the survey. In other cases, itâs worth asking the question when speaking to customers&mdash;either face-to-face or on the phone.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">There are some important subtleties and realizations as to why the question works so well.</p>
                <section id="calibre_link-239" class="level" data-number="5.11.2.1">
    
      <h4 data-number="5.11.2.1" class="calibre21">
        
        
          Reason 1: You put it to your customers, not to those who didnât buy from you
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">This might sound counterintuitive. Surely, you might think, if Alice buys one of your sports cars and Bob doesnât, itâs Bobâs opinions that you need to hear. But the problem with nonbuyers like Bob is that they are a mixed bunch. Some of them will be qualified to buy from you and many of them wonât. For example, some Bobs just want to test drive a sports car and have no intention of buying. If you ask Bobs why they didnât buy, their responses can be red herrings; often they complain about price. The Alices, on the other hand, are (by definition) qualified prospects. And youâd like more of them.</p>

          Reason 2: Your customers have been through the entire sales funnel and your noncustomers havenât
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Your customers know what they are talking about. Theyâve paid enough attention to make a decision, so they know enough to be able to make good suggestions. A noncustomer, on the other hand, may have bailed after only a few seconds. His or her opinion&mdash;however strong&mdash;is much less likely to be accurate. When your buyers criticize you, they are likely to be right.</p>

          Reason 3: Even though your customers overcame every barrier to buying from you, they werenât oblivious to the barriers
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">When you ask Alice, âWhat nearly stopped you buying from us?â she will still remember the biggest barriers. And for every Alice who successfully overcame the barriers, youâll almost certainly find there were several people who gave up. When you remove the barrier, sales increase.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">There are clear benefits to asking this question. And it works on <em class="calibre6">any</em> process that youâd like more people to complete.</p>

          Other things you need to know about your customers
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">You need to know which of your products your customers like most, and why.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The products that are most liked arenât necessarily the ones that you sell most of. Just because a restaurant might sell a lot of lasagna doesnât mean their lasagna is well liked. In fact, it might be deterring customers from ever coming back.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Discovering how well-liked each of your products is allows you to do two things:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Design the most effective sales funnel, so your most-liked products arenât hidden away; and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Improve your existing products, to make purchasers more likely to buy from you again.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">Your survey can constantly be changing, which will allow you to keep getting deeper insights into your visitors and customers. A survey may reveal insights that you decide to explore further in subsequent surveys.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">We have such a button on our website. Itâs a green âFeedbackâ button on the right-hand side of each page.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">The Roman poet Horace once said,</strong> âIf you wish me to weep, you yourself must first feel grief.â In other words, you canât arouse a feeling in someone until you have experienced that feeling yourself.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">In his book <a href="http://crelink.co/mww128" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><em class="calibre23"><span class="underline1">Making Ads Pay</span></em></a>, the veteran copywriter John Caples illustrated this by describing a demonstration that his physics professor once carried out (<a href="http://crelink.co/mww129" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">you can see it on YouTube</span></a>). The professor fastened two tuning forks close to each other, then struck one of them hard with a hammer. Its sound rang out like a chime. Then he seized the vibrating fork with his hand, and the music stopped. To the classâs surprise, the other tuning fork had started to vibrate and was giving off the same musical note.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Caples observed that emotional vibrations work in the same way; they travel from one person to another. When you write, the tuning fork within you must vibrate at the same frequency as the tuning forks within your visitors.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">So before you can write compelling copy, you must emotionally empathize with your visitors.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">It isnât easy, though. As a web marketer, your work is almost intrinsically ivory-tower work. Itâs hard to even meet your visitors, never mind empathize with them. So how do you develop this emotional resonance?</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Quantitative feedback tools&mdash;like clickstream analytics&mdash;donât help, because they just give you numbers. Qualitative feedback tools&mdash;like surveys&mdash;can give you the voice of the visitor, but they arenât sufficient to turn you into a tuning fork. Several of the following techniques (method marketing plus to a lesser extent face-to-face selling, encouraging visitors to phone you, and talking to âVOC aggregatorsâ)&mdash;are what we call <em class="calibre6">ultra-qualitative</em>. They are at the core of how we approach conversion. You donât hear much about them because no one has found a way to package them into neat little subscription services. Youâll never see ads for them. That doesnât make them any less valuable.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Method marketing</em> is a term that was coined by the marketer <a href="http://crelink.co/mww130" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Denny Hatch</span></a>. Itâs inspired by the âmethodâ approach to acting. Itâs said that when Robert De Niro came to New York for the filming of the movie <em class="calibre6">Taxi Driver</em>, he arrived early and proceeded to get a job as a real taxi driver. For two weeks, he worked long shifts. By the time filming began, De Niro was no longer a Hollywood celebrity trying to imagine how it must feel to be a taxi driver. He actually was a taxi driver. He had experienced the dangers. He had suffered the fatigue. And he felt at home in his car. He had gained the <a href="http://crelink.co/mww131" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><em class="calibre23"><span class="underline1">tacit knowledge</span></em></a> of a real taxi driver.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to learn from the words of others. Perhaps the best way to appreciate its power is to read the following list:</p>

                <p class="calibre4">Such hard-to-communicate knowledge is known as <em class="calibre6">tacit knowledge</em>. All our consultants gain tacit knowledge by doing method marketing. They become a customer and live the life of the customer. So by the time they begin copywriting, they are writing from the heart. Of course, they then face the challenge of communicating their tacit knowledge, trying to welcome outsiders into the club. Thatâs why copywriting is hard. But at least they are trying to persuade the visitors from the perspective of a knowledgeable insider&mdash;not a naive outsider.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">You can learn a lot from carrying out method marketing with competitors, particularly with offline ones. Most online businesses have offline equivalents that you can visit. Offline companies are less subject to ivory-tower syndrome than online companies, because they have face-to-face contact with customers. Their sales funnels tend to be more sophisticated.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">We learned that offline bingo is excellent regarding usability. Offline bingo halls have solved many problems that online bingo still hadnât solved. New players were led through an elegant onboarding process that introduced them to every type of game and service. The onboarding flow turned out to be just as applicable to online bingo as it was to offline.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">Your website is effectively your 24/7 robot salesperson. And the robot is no smarter than its inventor. If you canât sell your products in person, youâll struggle to sell them online.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Method marketing helps, but it allows you to understand only one customer (yourself). The best way to understand many customers well&mdash;albeit not quite so deeply&mdash;is to sell the product face-to-face.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">In 2003 our founders, Ben and Karl, ran a web business called <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/mobal-testimonial/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Mobal</span></a> that provided cell phones to travelers. Mobal had a large Japanese presence, so Nokia asked Mobal to set up and manage Japanâs first bricks-and-mortar Nokia store. We took on the project because we relished the opportunity for our team to spend time selling face-to-face with our visitors.</p>
            <section id="calibre_link-278" class="level" data-number="5.20.0.0.1">

                <p class="img1">By opening and running Japanâs first Nokia store, we learned rich insights that helped us to triple the sales of an online phone store.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Once the store was open, we created a spreadsheet for our team to complete. It contained two columns:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Column 1: Objections.</strong> To this column, our team members added all the objections that they heard from visitors. For example, visitors would say, âInstead of buying one of these phones, I will save money by buying a local prepaid SIM card when I arrive in my destination country.â</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Column 2: Counterobjections.</strong> To this column, our team members added the responses that they found to be the most effective. For example, in response to the objection above, we would reply: âIf you buy a local prepaid SIM card at your destination, you wonât know your phone number until you arrive, so your friends and family wonât know how to contact you.â</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">The spreadsheet of objections and counterobjections became our knowledge base of tried-and-tested sales copy. We incorporated its content into the website, to great success; we more than doubled the conversion rate and the revenue of the business.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Usually, though, you canât open a bricks-and-mortar store. The following example is from the other end of the scrappiness spectrum. While developing a new type of SIM card for world phones, we realized that we had spent too much time in our office ivory tower. <strong class="calibre2">So we visited a local flea market</strong>, where we spent several hours trying to sell the new prototype product face-to-face.</p>

                <p class="img1">If you donât have an offline store, create one. Flea markets are an easy way to get in front of users quickly.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">At first, we told our stallâs visitors that we were carrying out market research and that we wanted to hear their feedback. This had two problems: (1) people didnât want to speak about market research, and (2) those who did tended to give responses that were polite and false. Only when we tried to close the sale did we hear their true objections. So from then on, we tried to sell in earnest (even though our prime motive was to gather feedback). If a visitor showed interest, we would take down their name so we could notify them when the product became available.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This activity became a core part of our process for developing new products. Because our product was aimed at travelers, we soon graduated from flea markets to airports, where we would rent space for an exhibition stand.</p>

            <p class="calibre4">The closer you are to a business, the more you have the âcurse of knowledge,â the cognitive bias that makes it hard to see things through the eyes of those less experienced. It can help to read how other people have tried to describe your product. The following methods are often useful:</p>
            <ul class="calibre13">
                <li class="calibre14">
                    <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Read Wikipedia:</strong> If your company, your product, or the generic type of product has a page on Wikipedia, then study the words that the writers have used. Wikipedia articles are usually excellent in terms of intelligibility, which is particularly important for products that are technical or complex. We have seen several products for which the Wikipedia page was clearer and more persuasive than the companyâs official landing page. (We once tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade a client to point some of its AdWords traffic at its Wikipedia page.)</p>

Search Twitter and Facebook for instances of customers recommending your product to their followers. If your company has a tell-a-friend program that allows the customers to send a personalized message to their friends, then those messages can be a great source of sales copy. (Check first that you are OK to analyze those messages without breaking any laws or terms and conditions.) Not only do the messages reveal the persuasive arguments, but they also tell you the exact wording that customers use. By analyzing the frequency of words used, you can establish the lexicon you should use in your copywriting.</p>

          What VOC aggregators are, and why you need to find yours
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">According to Paul Graham of <a href="http://crelink.co/mww134" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Y Combinator</span></a>, to grow an early stage web business, you should spend all of your waking hours on the following three activities:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Build the product.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Talk to users.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Exercise.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">We agree. We spend a good fraction of our time talking with our clientsâ users. Itâs <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/usability-testing/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">priceless</span></a>, but itâs also time-consuming.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So we also talk to people who spend their whole lives speaking with users. For example, salespeople, consultants, and customer-support staff. We call these people âVoice-of-Customer Aggregatorsâ (or âVOC aggregatorsâ). VOC aggregators already understand the users. And they donât just know facts like âThe average user is forty years old with 2.4 childrenâ; they know the users intuitively, much like you know your own family. In fact, they can often second-guess how the users would react to a particular idea. Plus, because they speak with so many users, they know the relative importance of each issue. When you talk to a VOC aggregator, you harness the wisdom of thousands of hours of conversations with users.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Of course, you still need to talk to users. But you can accelerate your understanding by identifying your marketâs VOC aggregators and then talking to them.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">With this in mind, hereâs the updated formula:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Build the product.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p class="calibre15">Talk to users&mdash;<em class="calibre6">and to people who talk to users.</em></p>

          How to benefit from VOC aggregation
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Hereâs what you can do:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Identify your own industryâs VOC aggregators.</strong> They may be resellers, consultants, telesales people, customer-support people. They may work for your company or for other companies in the same supply chain. They may work for online companies, mail-order companies, or bricks-and-mortar companies. So, for example, when we work for manufacturers of consumer electronics, we spend a lot of time speaking with the staff of bricks-and-mortar electronics stores.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Talk to them.</strong> Ask them how they would sell your product. Their approach is likely to mirror the logic of how their customers buy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Implement as much of their feedback as you can.</strong> Add the rest to your product road map and marketing road map.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">While we were working with Sony, we visited a store that sold its devices. The shop assistant was great at selling the product.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">She sold several of the devices each week, and she knew the answers to all the questions that visitors asked. We asked her for her views on the productâs website, which she knew well because she had studied it when searching for answers to her visitorsâ questions. She described twenty-two facts that her visitors needed to know but that werenât mentioned on the companyâs website. We incorporated these facts into the webpage, making it much more persuasive.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">For many products, the salespeople hold decision trees in their heads. What they say depends on how visitors answered the previous questions. In such cases, you should map out the decision trees, consolidate them, and then turn them into conversion flows. We did exactly this for a blue-chip financial services company. After speaking with its call center team, we made changes that resulted in a 214% increase in orders.</p>

            <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">If your phone number is displayed prominently on your pages</strong>, speak with your inbound telesales team or whoever answers the calls. They will already understand your visitors deeply, with a level of empathy you could never get from a survey tool. In fact, you may well discover that your page should be a distilled version of words and logic that the salesperson says to the callers.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">If the price of your product is low, you may find that itâs economically unviable to invite phone calls. Regardless, <strong class="calibre2">we still recommend you add a phone number for just a day or so, for research purposes</strong>. The first few phone calls can reveal breakthrough insights. Not only do phone calls help you to understand your visitors, but they also help you to understand yourself. A phone call can be an âintuition pumpâ&mdash;on the phone, youâll find yourself intuitively using words and logic that you hadnât thought to write on your pages. Just as stand-up comedians come up with many of their best lines while performing in front of an audience, youâll find that much of your best sales copy comes while you are selling on the phone or in person, one-to-one.</p>

          How to recruit people to user test your website
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Ideally, your participants would be <strong class="calibre2">people who represent your target market</strong>. However, at first, you can get great results by testing on <strong class="calibre2">whoeverâs at hand</strong>. Those people sitting near you right now&mdash;theyâll do. Or a family member. This practice has a name: <em class="calibre6">hallway usability testing</em>&mdash;which makes it sound more legitimate than it feels when youâre doing it. Hallway usability tests are effective because many usability problems are so obvious they could be detected by anyone.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Once you sense that youâre getting diminishing returns from your hallway antics, and your websiteâs remaining problems are too sophisticated to be detected by a layman, start to look for test participants who are <strong class="calibre2">from the websiteâs target demographic</strong>. For example, when we doubled the sales of a <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/photoshelter-case-study/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">web app for photographers</span></a>, we recruited photographers to test the website. You can <strong class="calibre2">recruit visitors directly from the website</strong> using an invitation powered by <a href="http://crelink.co/mww142" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Ethnio</span></a> or <a href="http://crelink.co/mww143" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Hotjar</span></a>.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">It can be surprisingly effective to carry out what we call <em class="calibre6">retrospective moderated user tests</em>, in which you contact <strong class="calibre2">someone who has just completed your websiteâs goal</strong> (e.g., made a purchase), and ask them if theyâd be willing to retrace their steps. Such people are, by definition, qualified, and have recently gone through all of the thought processes required to buy. Take notes as they show you the path they took through your funnel, and ask them to describe what they thought at each stage. They tend to be excellent at recalling the hoops they had to jump through and the obstacles at which they nearly fell.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Counterintuitively, regardless of which of the previous methods you choose for recruiting, you tend to learn more from <strong class="calibre2">users who <em class="calibre6">arenât</em> web-savvy</strong>. People who use the web a lot tend to be better at coping with pages that contain errors. People who donât use the web much are more easily derailed&mdash;and can therefore provide more insights.</p>

          How to carry out a user test
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">If the participants arenât from your exact target market, tell them <strong class="calibre2">anything they need to imagine</strong>:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Do they need to pretend they are someone else?</strong> For example, if you were working on the website of a car manufacturer, you might say to the test participant, âImagine that you owned a car made by [company name].â</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Do they need to pretend they are in a particular situation?</strong> For example, you may need to say, âImagine that you are an existing customer and your car has broken down.â</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">Then, <strong class="calibre2">give them the task</strong> youâd like them to complete<strong class="calibre2">.</strong> The task is usually a typical goal of the website. For example, if your website sells quirky gifts, the task might be âAdd to your basket some <a href="http://crelink.co/mww144" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">smoking mittens</span></a>, some <a href="http://crelink.co/mww145" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">metal-detecting sandals</span></a>, and a <a href="http://crelink.co/mww146" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">photo-realistic bacon scarf</span></a>â (those are all real products, amazingly). You may choose to set the goal in general terms or specifically, depending on whether you want to exclude certain possibilities:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">To consider all possibilities, you may <strong class="calibre2">state the goal implicitly</strong>: âImagine that your car has broken down. What would you do next?â (About ten years ago, we carried out a user test in which the participant, to our surprise, asked for a Yellow Pages, and didnât even consider using a computer.)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">To be more specific, you may choose to <strong class="calibre2">state the goal in general terms</strong>: âHow would you get your car repaired?â</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">You may choose to <strong class="calibre2">state the goal specifically</strong>: âAssume you have typed [search terms] into Google and clicked on the first search result. You arrive on this page. How would you find the location of your nearest repair center?â</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">Encourage criticism. The participant needs to know that you wonât take criticism personally. We sometimes find it helps to pretend that the website was designed by someone else, and that we arenât happy with it. That way, the user feels more comfortable criticizing it.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">You want the visit to be as natural as possible. Tell them that once they have started the task, youâll stay quiet and watch, and youâll refrain from helping unless they really need you.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">During the test, take notes. Youâll soon have a huge list of ideas for improving your website. Most tests provide something worthwhile, and itâs rare to go more than three tests without getting an idea thatâs so important youâll want to stop everything until itâs implemented.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Steve Krug, the author of a great book called <a href="http://crelink.co/mww147" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><em class="calibre23"><span class="underline1">Donât Make Me Think</span></em></a>, has a <a href="http://crelink.co/mww148" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">useful script (a Word document)</span></a> for carrying out user tests. The script was designed for user tests in labs, so you may want to ignore the references to microphones and screen recordings.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The hardest thing about user testing is the emotional aspect. Not only can they feel awkward, but also they can make you want to cry. Because the truth hurts. For that reason, most marketers shy away from them. The best marketers are those who rapidly accept the criticism, use it to improve the page, and then user test again.</p>

            <p class="calibre4">Once you have fixed the more obvious problems with your website, itâs time to carry out some user tests on <em class="calibre6">qualified</em> prospects&mdash;that is, people who actually visit your website.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">A software platform called <a href="http://crelink.co/mww187" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Ethnio</span></a> provides an easy way of recruiting people for user tests.

            <p class="calibre4">Once Ethnio is installed on your website, you can use it to easily display a pop-up survey that asks your visitors if theyâd like to participate in a user test. You can target the survey to specific types of visitors&mdash;for example, those who use a particular browser or are in a specific geolocation. You can design the survey to ask questions that will help you to determine whether you want to interview the person. For example, you may ask them why they visited your website and whether this is their first visit.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">To incentivize people to participate in your tests, youâll probably need to offer a reward. We like to reward people with gift cards from <a href="http://crelink.co/mww189" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Amazon.com</span></a>, because they are quick to send and they require only the recipientâs email address. Also, visitors instantly recognize them as being valuable&mdash;theyâre clearly not some sneaky voucher thatâs full of weasel clauses and restrictions. With an incentive, about 5% of visitors tend to respond, though this varies greatly from industry to industry.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Peopleâs willingness to participate in user tests depends on which type of market youâre in; visitors to some types of website&mdash;such as financial services or health issues&mdash;tend to be reluctant to start a conversation. In other markets, visitors love to get involved.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Once visitors have completed the survey, their details appear in a table in Ethnioâs or Hotjarâs interface. You can then decide whether youâd like to carry out a user test with them.</p>

Ethnio can also help you to set up the call.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Bear in mind that the people who want to be interviewed are self-selecting; they donât necessarily represent your average visitor. In particular, they may be more time-rich and cash-poor than your average visitor. However, they still tend to be much more qualified than your average user testing participant.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">It can help to record the phone call. To do so, youâll need to get the userâs permission.</p>

          How to measure whatâs working if your website doesnât get much traffic
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">In the chapter on low-traffic websites, we explained how it can be difficult to measure whatâs working on low-traffic websites, because A/B tests often donât reach significance.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Many people with low traffic websites thus believe that testing isnât suitable for them.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">But that isnât the case. Done correctly, thereâs no reason why you shouldnât be testing often on your website and realizing all the benefits that go with it.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">How many conversions do you need for A/B testing? It depends on the following factors:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Your current conversion rate.</strong> The fewer conversions you get, the longer it takes to detect a doubling.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">The increase in conversion rate that youâre trying to detect.</strong> A 100% increase can be detected about four times as fast as a 50% increase.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">How statistically confident you want to be.</strong> If you wanted to be 99.99% sure that your new page wasnât winning just by chance, youâd have to wait a long time.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">So what should a low-traffic website do? Several strategies are effective:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Test the biggest, boldest ideas.</strong> When you have low traffic, itâs especially important to test big, bold ideas that are more likely to move the needle significantly. Test things that your visitors care about. Overcome their main objections. Highlight the things they love. Change the offer, or at least how itâs presented. Test things that might double or halve the number of conversions, but are unlikely to make no difference.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Measure âmicro-conversions.â</strong> Imagine conversion goals as a spectrum. On the right-hand side of the spectrum is what you ideally want&mdash;something like net profit or lifetime customer value. Such metrics tend to be untimely, meaning that youâd take months or years to measure their true value. On the left-hand side of the spectrum lie metrics like click-through rate or engagement rate. Such âintermediateâ metrics are much larger in number and can be measured instantly, but you canât be confident that they correlate with overall long-term success. The less traffic your website gets, the more you need to rely on âintermediateâ metrics toward the left-hand side of the spectrum.</p>

We often consolidate such pages into one, and then optimize the heck out of it.</p>

It would be a shame to conclude that âIf I canât have 95% confidence, I wonât run an A/B test at all.â Thatâs like saying, âIâm a perfectionist. If I canât do it perfectly, I wonât do it at all.â Most marketing decisions are made without any measurement, so donât rule out the possibility of ending a test at, say, 90% confidence&mdash;or even 85% confidence&mdash;especially if the alternative is just to launch the page and hope for the best. Sure, your chances of declaring false positives increase slightly, but the benefits of being able to test more ideas usually hugely outweighs the slim risk of promoting a page that was actually losing.</p>

In addition, though, you may choose to specify a maximum duration for each test, after which youâll make a decision regardless. If the control was winning at that point, you may choose to promote it. If the challenger was winning, and youâre confident that it was based on a research-driven hypothesis, then you may choose to promote it. If the challenger was based on a risky hypothesis, you may choose not to take the risk. Either way, this approach is more rigorous than how most early stage companies make decisions.</p>

            <p class="calibre4">Now that you know the techniques for understanding your visitors, try to identify which combination of them will give you the insights you need.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">As in many fields of creativity, it helps to have a spirit of experimentation. Donât give up because your first attempt did not reveal insights. Each technique and each question is like a spotlight that shines light on a different aspect of your visitorsâ behavior. The more information you gather, the more problems and opportunities you will spot.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">You might, for example, discover that your visitorsâ main objection is that they donât trust you. Or that you donât provide what they want. Or that they like what they see, but they are just browsing.</p>

      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">At the end of Section 1, we described the DiPS (Diagnose â Problem â Solution) formula for improving websites.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">We explained how you need to begin with <em class="calibre6">diagnosis</em>, to identify how your website can be improved.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Then, in Section 2, we described many of the diagnosis techniques we use. After implementing just a few of them, youâll have a big list of identified <em class="calibre6">problems</em> (which you may prefer to think of as <em class="calibre6">opportunities</em>).</p>
            <p class="calibre4">This section is about implementing <em class="calibre6">solutions</em> to those problems (opportunities). A good solution is one that eliminates the problem entirely, unblocking your websiteâs profits like that gloopy stuff unblocks the hairs from a shower drain&mdash;and in a manner thatâs no less satisfying.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Fortunately, not all blockages are unique. During the hundreds of research projects we have carried out, we have identified the major categories into which most problems fall. Your companyâs biggest problem will almost certainly be among them. Each of the following chapters is dedicated to one of those problems. Some of them are subtle; if you miss them, or fail to recognize their scope, you could waste time working on the wrong aspect of your business. (We see this happen a lot.) By reading each chapter, youâll become better at spotting each problem when you see it in research data.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Hereâs how to use this section of the book: Refer to your research to identify which problem is causing your visitors to abandon your website. Then, skip to the corresponding chapter, which will explain how to think about the problem, and will then describe some proven, effective ways of fixing it. Of course, there are many ways to overcome each problem. For example, there are over a hundred ways of overcoming lack of trust, and some of them are much more effective than others. For each problem, we will describe strategies that weâve found to be robust&mdash;that tend to work reliably in most situations.</p>

          Why you should learn to write clearly&mdash;and why so few people are good at it
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">When we ask a websiteâs visitors why they didnât buy, they often report that they were confused.</strong> They hadnât understood the words on the website. And visitors canât buy what they canât understand.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So, with millions of dollars at stake, why are many websites confusing?</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Because writing intelligibly is harder than it sounds. For example, read the following sentence from a popular newspaper, written by an otherwise great writer:</p>
                <blockquote class="calibre22">
                    <p class="calibre4">âDance music aficionados can argue interminably over which of the legendary singles Frankie Knuckles produced in the late 80s&mdash;singles, you can say without fear of contradiction, that played a part in changing the face of pop music for ever&mdash;is the best.â</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="calibre4">That sentence is free of typos and punctuation errors. And it uses sophisticated words accurately. According to many rules of English, itâs written well.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Yet most people struggle to understand it, let alone work out whatâs wrong with it, or how to fix it.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Itâs hard to write clearly. In fact, itâs hard to find someone who can teach you how to write clearly. Schools tend to spend more time teaching pupils how to sound smart, or how to analyze Shakespearian prose, than how to be understood. Students are more likely to be told to memorize poetry than to carry out a readability test.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This is a disservice. Poetry can be life-enriching, but the purpose of almost all writing is to communicate information.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So if your school didnât teach you how to write intelligibly, how can you learn?</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This chapter describes some fantastic resources for helping you to write more clearly. They have helped us to generate hundreds of millions for our clients. Itâs hard to overstate how useful they are.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">But first, letâs explore why so many writers are hard to understand.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">When most people want to improve their writing, they buy a book like <em class="calibre6">â<a href="http://crelink.co/mww201" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation</span></a>,â</em> which is about how to avoid making mistakes. Such books describe rules like the following:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">âWhen there are parentheses at the end of a sentence, put the period after the closing parenthesis (like this).â</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">âIf your whole sentence is in parentheses, put the period inside the closing parenthesis. (Like this.)â</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">Such rules may be useful to know, but they make little difference to whether your readers understand what you are saying.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Many teachers encourage writing in what Richard Lanham calls the âOfficial Styleâ&mdash;a style that sounds intelligent but that is hard to read. Lanhamâs book <a href="http://crelink.co/mww202" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><em class="calibre23"><span class="underline1">Revising Prose</span></em></a> teaches you how to translate Official-Style sentences into plain language. It contains a great example of how Warren Buffett, the worldâs most-famous investor, translated a fund prospectus into plain language. Buffett changed hard-to-read sentences likeâ¦</p>
                <blockquote class="calibre22">
                    <p class="calibre4">âAdjustments made to shorten portfolio maturity and duration are made to limit capital losses during periods when interest rates are expected to riseâ</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="calibre4">into easy-to-read text:</p>
                <blockquote class="calibre22">
                    <p class="calibre4">âWhen we expect a major and sustained increase in rates, we will concentrate on short-term issues.â</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="calibre4">No wonder fellow investors hang on Buffettâs every word.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The Official Style is prevalent in academic literature too. On the website <a href="http://crelink.co/mww203" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">LOL My Thesis</span></a>, graduates self-deprecatingly translate the titles of their theses from the Official Style into plain language&mdash;usually to comic effect:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">

                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">The rewritten titles are facetious, and many of them omit useful information. But they also reveal a truth: The Official Style is like medieval armor. It defends you from attack, but people can no longer hear what youâre saying.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If you were to write your website in the Official Style, your conversion rate would bomb. Your visitors would leave confused. Teachers and bosses may like intelligent-sounding text, but readers prefer text thatâs easy to understand.</p>

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">By far the most effective technique for improving your writing is simple: carry out readability tests. A readability test is simply a user test carried out specifically on a piece of writing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If you run readability tests on everything you write, youâll quickly become aware of how your readers struggle. Make a note of every point at which they falter, and then fix it. You can make the fixes during the test, or afterward, depending on how much fixing there is to do, and how quick you are at editing.</p>

          Be aware of the readerâs memory buffer
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">To make your writing easy to understand, thereâs one principle above all others that you should understand: You should be constantly aware of the readerâs <em class="calibre6">memory buffer</em>. As a person reads, his or her brain constantly processes and interprets the incoming words. In doing so, it loads the words into a short-term memory&mdash;a buffer&mdash;and then discharges them when the meaning has been understood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The buffer memory is surprisingly small&mdash;it struggles to hold more than about fifteen words. Fortunately, most sentences contain frequent resolution points, at which the meaning can be understood and the buffer unloaded. In the following examples, we have labeled with pipes (â|â) the main resolution points&mdash;the points at which the words in the buffer can be interpreted. We have also labeled, in <span class="fade">ever-fading</span> <span class="fade1">shades</span>, the points at which the short-term memory has gone too long without a break.</p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre22">
                        <p class="calibre4">Dance music aficionados| can argue interminably over| which of the legendary singles Frankie Knuckles produced in the late 80s&mdash;singles, you can <span class="fade">say without fear of contradiction, that played</span> <span class="fade1">a part in changing the face of</span> <span class="fade2">pop music for ever&mdash;is the best.</span>|</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="calibre4">The pipes feel like points at which your brain gets to âtake a breath.â When you read the faded words, you may get the same panicky feeling that you get when you are diving underwater and you are starting to run out of oxygen. By the time you reach the final pipe, your short-term memory is gasping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The following text contains another example of the same phenomenon:</p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre22">
                        <p class="calibre4">To pass the Bechdel test,| a movie must have at least two female characters| who are named| and talk to each other| about something other than a man.|</p>
                        <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Pulp Fiction</em>, all three movies of the original <em class="calibre6">Star Wars</em> trilogy, <span class="fade"><em class="calibre6">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II</em>, <em class="calibre6">The Social Network,</em></span> <span class="fade1"><em class="calibre6">Avatar</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Finding Nemo</em></span> <span class="fade2">reportedly fail the test.</span>|</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="calibre4">To understand where those resolution points (the pipes) lie, you could study linguistic parse trees. However, they are hard to learn. Fortunately, thereâs an easier way. With a few minutesâ practice, youâll discover that you can sense it, just by reading a sentence word by word, and noting the points at which your understanding resolves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">(Incidentally, <em class="calibre6">dependency length</em> is the number of words during which the reader needs to âhold their breathâ before they can reach a resolution point.)</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If you aim to go easy on your readersâ memory buffers, the following priceless rules of thumb emerge.</p>

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">You can enforce resolution points by keeping sentences short. A period is a resolution point. As you become more sophisticated, youâll discover that certain types of long sentences are fine, provided they have whatâs called right-branched clauses, like this one, or this one, or even this one.</p>

          Replace nominalizations with action verbs
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Nominalizations are where verbs are stated as though they were nouns. So, for example,</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Meet</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">a meeting</em>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Investigated</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">an investigation</em>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Tested</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">a test</em>.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Nominalizations are bad because they require a (usually meaningless) verb, like <em class="calibre6">had</em>, plus prepositions to link them:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Meet</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">had a meeting.</em> (What was being <em class="calibre6">had</em>?)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Investigated</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">held an investigation</em>. (What was being <em class="calibre6">held</em>?)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre6">Tested</em> becomes <em class="calibre6">carried</em> <em class="calibre6">out a test</em>. (What was <em class="calibre6">carried</em>?)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">You can spot nominalizations by looking for verbs that arenât really describing whatâs happening (like <em class="calibre6">had</em>, <em class="calibre6">held</em>, and <em class="calibre6">carried</em> in the sentences above). The verb <em class="calibre6">to be</em> is the most common culprit. If you ever see <em class="calibre6">to be</em> (or variants like <em class="calibre6">is</em> and <em class="calibre6">was</em>), youâll probably find a more action-ey verb hiding nearby, maybe inside a noun. Ask yourself, what is actually being done here? For example, when you see the following sentence:</p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre22">
                        <p class="calibre4">My recommendation <em class="calibre6">is</em> to carry out an improvement initiative on the website</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="calibre4">the word <em class="calibre6">is</em> indicates that the verb is hiding elsewhere. In this case, the verb is <em class="calibre6">recommend</em>, and itâs hiding in the word <em class="calibre6">recommendation</em>. You should rewrite the sentence as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre22">
                        <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">I recommend</em> we carry out an improvement initiative on the website.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="calibre4">But even that isnât going far enough. In the sentence above, is anything really being âcarried outâ? No, the presence of the words âcarry outâ reveal that another verb is hiding somewhere. In this case, the verb is <em class="calibre6">improve</em>, and it has buried itself in the noun phrase <em class="calibre6">improvement initiative</em>. You should further rewrite the sentence as follows:</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">I recommend we <em class="calibre6">improve</em> the website.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">And so, we have converted a twelve-word sentence into a six-word one. The readersâ memory buffers will thank us for it.</p>

          Some fantastic resources to improve your writing
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">On our office bookshelf, we have fifty-two books about writing, but only a few of them will help you to improve the <em class="calibre6">clarity</em> of your writing.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">We recommend you start at the top of the following list and work your way down. If punctuation bores you, donât be deterred. <strong class="calibre2">Most of the books arenât about grammatical pedantry</strong>; they are about simple, practical techniques that will transform you into a better writer. The one by Stephen Wilbers is so good&mdash;so <em class="calibre6">transformational</em>&mdash;youâll be amazed you havenât discovered it before.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">If youâre a sadist with a technical bent</strong>, you will enjoy running usability tests. During tests, we see users caught in wild-goose chases, scratching their heads, and sometimes swearing or even hitting their keyboards.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Why do marketers make websites that cause people to punch peripherals? Because marketers are afflicted with the <em class="calibre6">curse of knowledge</em>, a cognitive bias that makes it extremely difficult to think about a problem from the perspective of someone whoâs less informed. Marketers spend so long looking at their own websites, they canât imagine what it would be like to see the website for the first time.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">As a result, the websiteâs users appear to be stupid. Itâs a compelling illusion. But look at it another way:</p>

                    <li class="calibre14">

                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">We created a website to satisfy that desire.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">Usability is hard to learn because great examples are hard to detect. Usable solutions are invisibly elegant&mdash;like you never notice that you have a spleen until you have a problem with your spleen.</p>

          1. Watch a lot of user tests
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Most people are surprised when they first watch a user test. They are surprised that the visitors see and do things they hadnât expected. The more you watch user tests, the more you internalize the insights and become empathetic. First, you become aware of how erratic users can be. After that, you become better at second-guessing how users will behave.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Eyes donât move the way one might expect. They move from fixation point to fixation point in rapid jumps called <em class="calibre6">saccades</em>. The more you watch eye-tracking sessions, the more you become aware of how users see (and donât see) things. You learn the importance of controlling the usersâ eye movements.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">As you use the web, become aware of the page elements that each website uses. The best conversion practitioners have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the web. They appear to have read the whole of the internet. It comes in useful. When faced with a particular problem, it helps to be able to recall how another website has effectively solved it. We are avid collectors of effective marketing elements. Every time you see something that works well, take a screenshot of it and store it in a âswipe fileâ folder. Incidentally, this doesnât just apply to the web. Our swipe file contains thousands of examples from direct mail and offline space advertising for almost every industry.</p>

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">There are many good books about usability, but the following ones will teach you most of the concepts you need to know:</p>

                        <li class="calibre14">

          5. Use tools for wireframing and prototyping (so your designs can be user tested before they get coded up)
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">To make your designs usable, design them in a format that makes them easy to edit.</strong> (In fact, thatâs true for anything you ever create.) Once you have designed a first draft, user test it on one or two people, and then incorporate your insights into the design and user test again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">In doing so, you get a frequent sanity check that you are proceeding along the right lines.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Every medium has its own low-fidelity format. Fiction writers use plot outlines. Moviemakers use storyboards. Artists use pencil outlines. And web designers use wireframes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">A wireframe shows the layout of a page, with key text, but without any detail. Most of the images in Section 3 of this book are wireframes. The most important feature of a wireframe (or of any low-fidelity format) is that it contains only the core ideas with no incidental trimmings. This gives three big advantages:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15">Wireframes are easy to create and edit. A change that takes a company a week to implement on a live website may take ten seconds to make on a wireframe.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15">Wireframes are easy to interpret. We once observed a user test of a page that had been designed in high fidelity. âI donât like the colors,â the user commented. âIgnore the colors,â the designer replied. âI donât like the cartoon dog,â the user said. âIgnore the dog,â the designer replied. âI donât like the feel of the page,â the user said. âIgnore the feel,â the designer responded. The user became irritated: âFor heavenâs sake, what are you asking me to look at?!â With wireframes, users intuitively understand what you are trying to show them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15">Wireframes help <em class="calibre6">you</em> to focus on what matters: the words. To illustrate this, take one of your pages, select all the text, and paste it into a plain text editor. You may be surprised at what you see. (For many websites, this exercise is much more useful than it may sound.) Some pages are so beautifully designed, itâs easy to overlook the words. But the words are what win A/B tests.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Ten years ago, the best way to create wireframes was with paper and Post-its. Some people still prefer to work that way. However, there is now an abundance of good software for doing it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">The following wireframing tools make it easy to display your work-in-progress designs.</strong> Some of them allow you to create working prototypes.

            <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">For over ten years, we have been urging companies to dominate their markets.</strong> In fact, thatâs one of the main things that we help our clients to do. Many of them are now leaders in their verticals. In this chapter, we describe a powerful growth strategy thatâs hidden in plain sight. Itâs used by many of the webâs most successful companies, itâs ridiculously effective for dominating an industry, and yet many companies overlook it.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Itâs based around a major conversion killer: lack of interest.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Hereâs what we mean by âlack of interestâ:</p>
            <ul class="calibre13">

            </ul>
            <p class="calibre4">What can you do about that? <em class="calibre6">Should</em> you do anything about that?</p>
            <p class="calibre4">In this chapter, we hope to persuade you that itâs <em class="calibre6">imperative</em> that you do something about it. And then we go on to describe a step-by-step process for implementing this strategy&mdash;a strategy by which many companies wipe out their competitors.</p>

          How superstores&mdash;and leading e-commerce stores&mdash;use this principle to gain a formidable advantage
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Itâs crucial that your company becomes the dominant player in its industry, by satisfying as many of your visitorsâ intentions as possible.</strong> If it doesnât, another business will take that space, capture those economies of scale, and push your company out.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Most superstores sell a huge number of products. If a visitor wants bananas then, yes, the superstore has bananas. If a visitor wants pet insurance then, yes, the superstore sells that too. And if a visitor wants childrenâs T-shirts then, yes, it sells those too. By satisfying all of the visitorsâ intentions and desires, the store mops up more of the money that the visitors are willing to spend.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The preceding approach has a huge impact. If you can satisfy twice as many of your visitorsâ intentions, you effectively halve the cost of acquiring a customer. (Because the cost of acquisition gets divided over twice as many purchases.) Plus, if a visitor can get everything they want from you, they are less likely to visit one of your competitors.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">For contrast, letâs consider an imaginary company that <em class="calibre6">couldnât</em> easily adopt the above strategy</strong>. Letâs call it âOne Trick Squirrel.â One Trick Squirrel makes nothing but smooth peanut butter. It doesnât even make the type with bits in. (It disposes of the bits in a landfill site.) One Trick Squirrel Peanut Butter could be the best in the world, but a One Trick Squirrel store could never be large, because it satisfies only one need&mdash;and few people want all of their weekly groceries to be peanut butter.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Thereâs a limit to how large a store can become if it doesnât satisfy many visitorsâ intentions. Amazon began to do this early, presumably because many of its senior team members were from the retail industry, so they understood this economic imperative. So if you visit Amazon.com and search for a book called <em class="calibre6">Soils of Outer Mongolia</em>, <a href="http://crelink.co/mww323" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">you will find what you need</span></a>.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Amazon created Amazon Marketplace to ensure that whatever a visitor wants, Amazon can provide (even if itâs via a marketplace seller). Amazon understands the importance of giving visitors whatever they want. Itâs good for financial reasons, but itâs also great for the visitor experience. And it means that Amazon is often the first place that Amazonâs customers look&mdash;to the extent that some people forget that there are alternatives. Amazon is now nicknamed âThe Everything Storeâ&mdash;and that was by strategy, not by chance.</p>

          How to do gap analysis for visitor intentions: a practical process that can generate breakthrough results
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">We use the following process to identify&mdash;and quantify&mdash;the opportunities for satisfying a websiteâs visitor intentions. Begin by using an on-page survey to ask your visitors why they visited your website:</p>

(For example, if one response was âBuy pet insuranceâ and another was âTo see if I should get pet insurance,â you might want to categorize them both as âPet insurance.â)</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Column 3: Do we satisfy this intention?</strong> Enter a yes or a no, depending on whether this is a visitor intention that your website satisfies. For the example above, if you did sell pet insurance, youâd write âYes.â If you didnât, youâd write âNo.â</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Column 3 may reveal that you satisfy only a small percentage of your visitorsâ needs. Many companies accept this as inevitable. If the visitor wants pet insurance, and the website doesnât offer pet insurance, the company dismisses the visitor as having been unqualified.</p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Columns 4 and 5 allow you to estimate the opportunity cost, revealing how you could increase your profit per visitor. For new products, you will have to estimate the value for Column 5. You can base your estimates on knowledge of your competitorsâ sales; information from suppliers; sales figures from a trial run; or calculations based on the survey responses, making assumptions about conversion rates.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Why is it so important to increase the profit per visitor?</strong> Because for many websites, the key metric is the acceptable cost per acquisition, which is how much you can afford to spend on acquiring each visitor. And that figure depends on how much profit you can generate from each visitor. Soâ¦</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">

                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Of course, conversely, if your competitors can monetize your visitors better than you can, then thereâs a good chance they can do the same to you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">(It might sound mercenary to talk about âmonetizing visitors.â However, from a visitorâs-eye view, monetization tends to be a good thing; as a consumer, youâll find that thereâs a large correlation between the companies you like and the ones you give money to.)</p>

                <p class="calibre4">The following methods may help you identify products and services that would satisfy your visitorsâ intentions:</p>

                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Method 1:</strong> Temporarily add a Google AdSense box to the page. AdSense is powered by auction bidding, so the ads that are shown will be those that the advertisers (and Google) are confident will persuade your visitors to spend money. Once the ads are live on your website, study which products and services they promote.</p>

                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Method 3:</strong> Identify companies that have similar economics to yours, and look at which products they cross-sell. Perhaps your company sells a B2B commodity, like safety signage. If so, look for other companies that sell B2B commodities, and see what other products and services they offer. You may be inspired to discover that the domain registrar GoDaddy cross-sells office productivity software. Or that the printing company Vistaprint cross-sells an email-marketing service. Not only will this reveal products you should be cross-selling, but you may also discover that the similar companies (like GoDaddy)&mdash;or even the cross-sold companies (like the office software)&mdash;should be cross-selling your products.</p>

Armed with the data, Morphsuits started manufacturing the new type of suit, safe in the knowledge that there was zero risk in creating it. The new suit became a top seller. We werenât surprised. We even knew approximately how many it would sell.</p>

          A more buyer-centric definition of value proposition
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">The previous definition can be a bit too seller-centric. To aid clear thinking, we also find it useful to think of a value proposition as perceived through the eyes of an individual buyer. This view reflects more accurately what happens when a purchase is made:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The decision is made in the mind of the buyer.</p>

                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The value of each feature will be different for each buyer. For example, some car buyers will find value in an ashtray; others wonât. Either way, itâs clear that the âvalueâ being discussed is the value to each buyer. Thus, in the customerâs-eye definition, the value proposition is different for each buyer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Buyersâ reasoning tends to be in terms of pros and cons, not benefits and costs&mdash;just listen to your own reasoning next time you buy something. If you create mental âpros and consâ lists and not âbenefits and costsâ lists, then it seems a shame to switch to the benefits-and-costs view when youâre being a marketer, thus abandoning your lifetime of intuition.</p>

                </ul>

                <p class="calibre4">We find it useful to view a value proposition both ways&mdash;through the sellerâs eyes and the buyerâs eyes&mdash;as two sides of the same coin.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Some marketing experts say that all sales copy should be expressed not in terms of <em class="calibre6">features</em> (a productâs properties) but in terms of <em class="calibre6">benefits</em> (how the product helps the user). This isnât true. You should sometimes state the features, sometimes state the benefits, and often state both.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The âbenefits, not featuresâ advice was aimed at beginner copywriters, who often write only in terms of features. Features usually arenât enough. <strong class="calibre2">When buyers read features, they often think, âSo what?â</strong> They donât understand how the features will help.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If, as a buyer, you discover that a particular eBook reader has the feature of cellular connectivity, you may think âSo what? How would that be useful?â So you may appreciate an explanation of the <em class="calibre6">benefits</em> of cellular connectivity&mdash;that it allows you to buy and instantly download books from anywhere in the world. If you finish your book while youâre lying on the beach on vacation, you can instantly choose and start a new one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Sometimes, even obvious benefits are worth stating. You might understand that a flight will take you to a sunny Italian resort, but an explicit mention of that benefit will still psychologically take you there. It activates those neurons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">However, there are times when you shouldnât explicitly mention benefits. One of them is when the benefit is <strong class="calibre2">taboo</strong>. A charity website shouldnât explicitly say, âDonate today and you can show off to your friends.â Another is when the benefit is so obvious&mdash;or unimpressive&mdash;as to be <strong class="calibre2">a waste of words</strong>, and possibly patronizing. On a car manufacturerâs website, itâs probably worth mentioning that a car has a maximum speed of 120&nbsp;mph, but it wouldnât be worth explaining the benefits of that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The second half of âmention benefits <em class="calibre6">and not featuresâ</em> is clearly nonsense. You should usually state features. Imagine a laptop manufacturerâs website that says, âLets you store loads of filesâ but then refuses to state the size of the hard drive. <strong class="calibre2">Benefits alone can leave the reader thinking, âYeah, right.â</strong> Benefits usually need proof to support them, and features are among the most compelling forms of proof. Itâs not enough to hear that a car is âreally, really safe.â You want to know it has air bags.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">So when <em class="calibre6">shouldnât</em> you mention features? You should omit them <strong class="calibre2">when the benefit is not in doubt&mdash;or when there is little space and the benefit is better supported by a different type of proof</strong>. With fitness videos, for example, customers are much more persuaded by celebrity endorsements and by testimonials from other successful customers than they are by whatâs in the video itself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">You become more effective at CRO when you ignore rules like âTechnique X is good; Technique Y is badâ and instead understand each techniqueâs function. Now that you understand the <em class="calibre6">function</em> of features and benefits, youâll be able to spot when to state a feature, when to state a benefit, and when to state both. <strong class="calibre2">Remember, if you describe a feature and the readers are saying, âSo what?â describe the benefit. If you describe a benefit and the readers are saying, âYeah, right,â describe the feature (or another type of proof).</strong></p>

          2. Many companies donât make it clear what their products or services do
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Some products or services&mdash;particularly those that are complex&mdash;can be hard to describe. When such products are sold using a traditional brand-marketing approach, the results are often disastrous. The visitors donât buy because they donât understand what theyâll get.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">For example:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Unclear branding waffle:</strong> âMusic, Meet Home.â</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Copy that wins:</strong> âThe worldâs leading speaker system: Play any song in any room from any phone.â</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Another example:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Unclear branding waffle:</strong> âIntroducing the oases of freshness: The Aquaris, the Tritona, the Anapos.â</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Copy that wins:</strong> âChoose your water filter jug: a slim one for the fridge, a large one for the table, or a watertight one for on the go.â</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Letâs have one more:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Unclear branding waffle:</strong> âExpress yourself. Impress yourself.â</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Copy that wins:</strong> âThe ultimate suite of cloud-based tools for all your marketing communications.â</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">You get the idea.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">If you are asked to improve the website of a technical product that is currently being sold with a brand-marketing approach, hereâs a useful tip: see if the product has a Wikipedia page. The Wikipedia page is likely to contain valuable plain-language descriptions that are absent from the manufacturerâs landing page. Plain language almost always beats branding waffle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Many marketers arenât aware that their website has this problem. The problem goes beneath the radar because visitors seldom report that they are âstruggling to understand the value proposition.â Instead, they say things like âIâm still researching.â Also, most unclear descriptions arenât as obviously bad as the ones above. The best way to identify unclear benefits is through user testing. During user tests, listen for clues that the users havenât understood the product or service. For example, you may find that a userâs objections to buying donât make sense. Or that the user has gone quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Unclear product descriptions are guaranteed to kill conversions. So whenever we spot them, we know that a big win is just around the corner. Clarifying the benefits of complex, hard-to-explain products has led to many of our biggest wins.</p>

          3. Some companies forget to mention some valuable benefits
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">The travel-phone company <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/mobal-testimonial/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Mobal</span></a> gave away a high-quality travel adapter with every phone. But it forgot to mention the travel adapter anywhere on its website. When we added the travel adapter to the website, sales increased. So we added it to the offline marketing campaigns too. This was one of the many contributing factors that allowed us to triple Mobalâs sales in one year.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">We used this technique to great effect when we created more than $1 million of additional sales for <a href="http://crelink.co/mww327" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">Moz</span></a>. In <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/seomoz-case-study/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">a case study on our website</span></a>, we describe how we added to Mozâs landing page many features that previously went unmentioned.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">To ensure that you arenât making this mistake</strong>, list all of the elements of value that your visitors get, and then check that your website communicates them all clearly. It can help to order the product yourself, so you see the whole package with your own eyes. Also, ask your customers why they bought, and then ensure that all of their reasons are featured in your marketing materials with appropriate prominence.</p>

          4. Many companies donât make it clear what happens once the visitor says yes
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Many websites&mdash;particularly those that sell services&mdash;donât help their visitors to envisage the postorder experience. There are many ways of overcoming this problem. The following method, common in Japan, is <strong class="calibre2">rarely seen in the Western world</strong>. Japanese consumers expect to be shown what they are going to get. All Japanese restaurants, for example, have plastic food in their windows, showing what each meal looks like.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Similarly, many Japanese companies display cartoon flow charts that show what will happen once a visitor orders the product or service. We created the following flow chart for Mobal, to show Mobalâs Japanese customers what to expect once they had ordered a travel phone.</p>

                        <p class="calibre4">The flow chart makes it clear how the process works: the order is placed, the phone is delivered, the phone is charged, the person flies abroad, calls are made, Mobal sends an itemized bill, the person returns home, and then the whole process is repeated for subsequent trips. The cartoon was so effective on the Japanese website, we transferred it to Mobalâs USA website, to similar success.</p>
                        <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Such flow charts are an example of what the hypnotism world calls <em class="calibre6">future pacing</em>:</strong> The buyer is told what they are going to experience over the next few days, weeks, or months. (This is closely related to the sales technique of making the prospect âthink beyond the sale.â) Even though future-pacing diagrams are less common in the West, they are extremely effective everywhere, for the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul class="calibre13">
                            <li class="calibre14">

                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Once you have created a future-pacing diagram, you may find that it would benefit from being turned into a video.</strong> If so, remember that the process of creating a video should be no different from the process of creating a webpage. To begin, create the video in a low-res, highly editable format, which you can test on users&mdash;just as you would do with a webpage wireframe. If your video designer isnât comfortable carrying out user tests (in our experience, most arenât), you may prefer to do it yourself, as follows:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">

                    <p class="calibre4">Would your business benefit from economies of scale? (Most web businesses do.) If so, your ideal pricing strategy may be <strong class="calibre2">penetration pricing</strong>&mdash;charging a low price, basing your financial model on eventually reaching market-dominating economies of scale.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Supply-side economies of scale</strong> mean that your profit margins increase the more you sell, because as you sell more, your <strong class="calibre2">cost of sales</strong> (unit costs) usually becomes lower, and your <strong class="calibre2">fixed costs</strong> become a smaller fraction of your overall costs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Demand-side economies of scale</strong> mean that the more customers you get, the more value each customer gets from your service, for the following reasons.</p>

For example, if a phone system had only two users, only one type of call could be made (one between User&nbsp;A and User&nbsp;B). If it had three users, then three types of call could be made (A&ndash;B, B&ndash;C and A-C). If it had twelve users, sixty-six different types of calls could be made. The overall value of a phone system to its users is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users.</p>

          If you donât have economies of scale, it often helps to price high then decrease prices
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Pricing high at first, then lowering prices is good for mopping up all the money available in the marketplace. A book can be launched in hardback only, thus commanding a high price from those who are willing to pay it, and then later it can be released in paperback for mass-market sales. This approach tends to be more effective with products (e.g., consumer electronics) than as a strategy with platforms (e.g., online stores). It also allows statements like âUsed to be $XXXâ to be used in the future advertising. However, this approach has a weakness: business writer Peter Drucker stated that high prices can effectively âhold an umbrellaâ over lower-priced competitors, allowing them to thrive.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">You can identify gaps in the market by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">For a given type of product or service, pricing low and pricing high each has its advantages. The challenge is to work out where on the continuum your winning strategy lies:</p>

                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15">For products that are otherwise clearly identical, <strong class="calibre2">low prices</strong> tend to lead to high conversion rates (customers/visitors), more repeat purchases (or higher customer retention), high tell-a-friend rates and word-of-mouth, and favorable reviews.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">High prices</strong> lead to a higher profit per customer. If you increase your prices and your conversion rate doesnât fall too much, you may be able to afford to spend more per visitor than your lower-priced competitors.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Neither of the above two options is intrinsically better than the other.</strong> But bear in mind that, in any market, there can only be one cheapest option&mdash;and that many people donât want the cheapest option: most people donât buy the cheapest car available, the cheapest shampoo available, the cheapest clothes available, the cheapest watches available, and the cheapest insurance available. People tend to buy options they perceive to be of higher value. There are many opportunities for selling at high profit margins, provided you can find features and benefits for which customers would be willing to pay a premium. A good mindset is to imagine that you will charge a premium price, and then use your marketing knowhow to justify that price.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Note that many companies take external investment to fund their costs of client acquisition in the short term. The investment gives them all the previously mentioned benefits of high prices and low prices, and is based on the assumption that the strategic benefits of growing quickly will be worth it in the end.</p>

                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Information</strong> is a great thing to give away as a premium, because it has zero (or almost zero) costs of sale and can have incredibly high perceived value. Think of valuable information that your customers would love to have. For example, a person buying a health supplement to help them sleep may highly desire a report that describes how to get a good nightâs sleep. You can deliver the information in a wide range of formats, including audio, video, electronic or printed reports, software, tools, or access to websites.</p>

This works well in B2B sales, because B2B buying is often complex. B2B buyers therefore value <strong class="calibre2">âdecision-support materials.â</strong> A seller of web hosting, for example, could benefit from giving away a guide called â7 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Web Hosting Solution.â</p>

One of our favorite techniques is to offer a valuable free report for customers who buy one unit, an additional free report for customers who buy three units, and a further free report for customers who buy five units. A buyer who wants that third report can never get it if they always order one unit at a time. This offer alone can greatly increase the average order value.</p>

He found one that looked good, but it cost just $70. He decided against it, preferring to stick to his plan of finding one that cost more. Imagine how frustrated the store owner would have been to know that not only did she not sell the suit, but that she would have sold it if she had charged ten times as much for it.)</p>

Then, start from the point of view of the customer: begin with the price theyâd be prepared to pay, and then work out what the product or service should be at that level. Ensure that each price level contains a âdeal makerâ or âdeal breakerâ component that makes it worth it for the buyer to pay the extra amount.</p>

          Test your prices to see which ones win
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Testing pricing can be a thorny issue. Some users may contest it. However, changing pricing is one of the most surefire ways of increasing (or decreasing) a companyâs profits, so thereâs a high value in doing it (and a high cost to getting it wrong&mdash;which is a good reason to A/B test it).</p>
                <p class="calibre4">One effective option is to run A/B testing to <strong class="calibre2">offer different prices to different users</strong>, but then, <strong class="calibre2">once they have ordered, to charge them all the lower price</strong>, to make it fair. Bear in mind that&mdash;as with all A/B testing&mdash;buyers who use more than one device may see different versions of your pricing.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Another (less scientific) option is to <strong class="calibre2">test different prices on different days or weeks</strong>.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">In both cases, it can be hard to measure the results if your buying cycle is long. But if itâs short, and you sell a lot of units per day, you can gather vital information in a matter of hours.</p>

If youâre selling a shed, compare it to the cost of having a house extension. If youâre selling a video conferencing solution, compare it with the price of international travel. You can make almost any product sound like a great deal by comparing it to the price of something the buyers are already squandering their money on, like lattes or beer.

            <p class="calibre4">This is usually because your website lacks relevant trust signals. There simply isnât enough proof that the visitors should use you. This chapter describes some highly effective ways to use proof to improve your companyâs credibility (and sales).</p>
            <p class="calibre4">What kind of proof should you add? There are tens&mdash;maybe hundreds&mdash;of ways to show trust and credibility. Some of them are particularly suited to certain types of businesses, but most businesses benefit from the following:</p>

                <p class="calibre4">So if you sell cat food, itâs not enough to say that cats like the taste of it. Why would people believe you? A popular cat food brand supported its claim with data: âEight out of ten owners said their cat prefers it.â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Insurance companies donât say, âWe make it easy to save on car insurance.â They support their claims with data, like: â15 minutes can save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Restaurants that deliver fast food donât say, âWeâll be there as fast as our bikes can carry us&mdash;we promise.â They say things like âDelivered in 30 minutes&mdash;or itâs free.â</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Hand soap manufacturers donât say that their product âKills a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> of germs.â They say, âKills 99.9% of germs.â It sounds much more convincing.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">And in its 1962 ad, a particular oil refining company didnât just say âWe supply a lot of oil.â It said, âEach day, we supply enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!â</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Celebrity associations can be more effective than you might expect. When selling a diet, for example, many people will be more influenced by a celebrity figurehead than by scientific research.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Over the years, we have paired several of our clients with celebrity figureheads. Most of the celebrities allow their image to be used in return for a fixed fee for a specific duration. In one case, the celebrity was happy to do it for free, because she was a fan of the company.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">A word of warning. Before you commit to a deal, though, you may choose to first run an A/B test to measure how the celebrity affects conversions. One of our clients had a celebrity figurehead whose presence actually <em class="calibre6">reduced</em> sales. The clientâs branding agency hadnât carried out A/B tests (weâve yet to see one that does), and so was oblivious that they had caused such damage.</p>

            <p class="calibre4">Used right, it can cut through customer objections.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">Used wrong, it can cut through profits.</p>

          When (and why) do guarantees work?
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Guarantees donât always increase sales.</strong> To understand when a guarantee would help, consider the two major functions of a guarantee:</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Function 1: A guarantee <strong class="calibre2">reduces the risk</strong> for the customer. If the company doesnât fulfill the guaranteeâs promise, the customer is compensated.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Function 2: A good guarantee <strong class="calibre2">self-evidently promises that your business will be harmed</strong> if you donât honor your claims. It effectively says, âOur promise must be true. Otherwise we wouldnât be in business.â It thus acts as a kind of <strong class="calibre2">proof</strong>.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Many people underestimate the importance of Function 2.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So, guarantees are effective whenâ¦</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">the visitors want what the company is promising,</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">but they are <strong class="calibre2">nervous about the risk</strong>, or are <strong class="calibre2">skeptical about the claims</strong>,</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">and <strong class="calibre2">your service lives up to its claims</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">In such cases, the new guarantee can have amazing results. Just by adding and perfecting a guarantee, we boosted one of our clientâs sales by almost 50%.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">A guarantee would not be effective for a hot dog cart, though. Because visitors arenât nervous about wasting a few dollars on a hot dog. And hot dog carts donât make claims that make visitors skeptical.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">However, if a hot dog cart were to claim to sell âthe best hot dog youâve ever tasted,â then a guarantee would help to overcome the prospectsâ natural skepticism. And if the cart were to increase the price of its hot dogs to $10, a guarantee (such as â$10 for the best hot dog you have ever tasted&mdash;or itâs freeâ) would help to reduce customersâ risk, and therefore increase the sales.</p>

          Ingredients of a highly effective guarantee
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">A great guarantee contains the following ingredients:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">It should guarantee that <strong class="calibre2">the customer will get the benefits they desire</strong>. (In fact, you may consider charging in terms of the benefit&mdash;like razor blade manufacturers make their money on the blades, not the handle.) And it should <strong class="calibre2">address the main risks</strong> about which the buyer is tentative. If the buyer is worried about whether the product will achieve a particular result, offer a <em class="calibre6">performance guarantee</em>. If the buyer is worried whether theyâll be happy, offer a <em class="calibre6">satisfaction guarantee</em>. If the buyer is worried about whether the price is good enough, offer a <em class="calibre6">price-match guarantee</em>. A guarantee will be effective only if it addresses an existing concern.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">It should <strong class="calibre2">offset the risk</strong>&mdash;and ideally neutralize it&mdash;so, if things go wrong, the buyer will be compensated for their time, effort, and cost.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">It should <strong class="calibre2">have a name</strong>, indicating that itâs a tangible thing. For example, âOur 100% Money-Back Guaranteeâ or âLifetime Guarantee.â The name makes a good headline.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The best guarantees are worded positively. They donât say, âIf you dislike our serviceâ¦â; they say, âWe guarantee that youâll love our service.â <strong class="calibre2">The most common mistake with guarantees is to word the guarantee negatively&mdash;as a âget-out clauseâ&mdash;rather than in positive terms, as a promise.</strong> When you bring up the subject of returns, use a phrase like âIn the unlikely event thatâ¦â</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Explain why you can afford to make the guarantee</strong>&mdash;because you arenât really taking a risk; most customers are delighted.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Sometimes it helps to put the guarantee <strong class="calibre2">in the voice of the companyâs chief spokesperson</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Consider giving the guarantee a <strong class="calibre2">long claim period</strong>. A guarantee with a deadline is effectively a time-limited offer. The buyer has a certain number of days to make a decision. If your guaranteeâs claim period is short&mdash;fourteen days, for example&mdash;the principle of urgency will be strongly working against you. On the other hand, increasing your claim period from twelve months to twenty-four months doubles your financial risk with possibly no incremental increase in conversion rate. The optimal period depends on many factors, including your cost of sales, the quality of the product, the time a customer perceives they will need to evaluate the product, the typical lifetime of the product, and the impracticality of returning the product. To identify the optimal duration, we find it useful to use financial scenario modeling supported by A/B testing data.</p>

                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">At the point of sale, it should be evident that your guarantee is <strong class="calibre2">easy to invoke</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Emphasize that <strong class="calibre2">no strings are attached</strong>. In particular, customers often worry that the guarantee will be nullified if they use the product&mdash;or even take it out of the box&mdash;so emphasize that they are encouraged to use it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Promise youâll give a <strong class="calibre2">prompt refund</strong>. Customers worry that it may take a long time to get the money back.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The guarantee should be <strong class="calibre2">featured at all the points where the buyer is thinking of the risk</strong>. Thatâs usually near the call to action. Sometimes, itâs up front, too. You may also choose to mention it when they abandon.</p>

          A nine-step checklist for implementing a guarantee safely
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Is your company hesitant to offer a bold guarantee? Thatâs understandable. A guarantee can do harm if itâs implemented badly. Also, with guarantees the feedback loop is long, because you canât calculate the costs of invoked guarantees until after the guarantee period has expired.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The following workflow provides a low-risk way to implement a bold guarantee:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Create the guarantee</strong>, based on the principles described previously.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Carry out scenario modeling, as follows:</strong> Create a table in which the columns represent different values of âuplift in conversion,â and the rows represent different values of âpercentage of customers who invoke the guarantee.â Then work out the net change in profit for each combination. Also consider how guarantee claims would be handled operationally (accepting returns, restocking shelves, issuing refunds, etc.). If you are satisfied that the guarantee will generate additional profits, then proceed to the next step.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Run the guarantee as an A/B test for a short time</strong>&mdash;for just a few days, if thatâs all the risk you can bear.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Wait for the guarantee period to expire.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Calculate the increase in profits</strong>, based on the measured uplift in sales.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Calculate the cost of people invoking the guarantee.</strong> In our experience, the invocation rate tends to be lower than companies expect, sometimes by an order of magnitude.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">If you need more data (which you probably will), return to Step 3</strong> and run the guarantee for longer. By doing this in small increments, you remove the risk caused by the long feedback loop.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">If you do have enough data</strong>, and the increase in profit more than offsets the cost of returns, make the guarantee permanent.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Return to Step 1</strong>, creating a bolder guarantee.</p>

          The most fruitful activities regarding guarantees
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Weâve had wins from many types of guarantees: price-match guarantees, satisfaction guarantees, payment-deferral guarantees&mdash;even good-weather guarantees. The wins typically come from three activities:</p>
                <ol class="calibre20">
                    <li class="calibre14">

                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Improving the wording</strong> of a guarantee (some guarantees should be compact, and some should be long);</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Placing the guarantee <strong class="calibre2">at the right point</strong> in the conversion flow.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="calibre4">If risk is a factor for your visitors, then those three activities are likely to be effective for you.</p>

          The boldest guarantee we have tested
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">We tested a particularly bold guarantee for the travel phone company Mobal. Previously, using financial modeling, we had correctly identified that Mobal could make huge profits by selling each phone at a subsidized price, and then making all of its money from subsequent call charges. So each time we sold a phone, we made a significant short-term loss. Offering a guarantee on such an offer might have sounded reckless.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Because the stakes were so high, we carried out a scenario analysis. It forecast that a guarantee would be likely to increase the overall profits, even taking into account the costs of servicing the guarantee. (This is where it helps to have a PhD scientist on your team.)</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Fortunately, our modeling paid off. We tested a sixty-day satisfaction guarantee&mdash;which was even longer than the average customerâs trip. The conversion rate rose, and the return rate turned out to be much lower than our safeguards had allowed for&mdash;so the guarantee was a huge success. Before long, the conversion rate was so high, Mobal was able to invest profitably up to a quarter of a million dollars per month in offline advertising, and the sales tripled within twelve months to $9.1 million.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">About twenty-five years ago, offline bookstores learned not to push the hard sale. They discovered they could convert a visitor from âjust browsingâ to âbuyingâ by making their stores highly conducive to reading. They added chairs, reading areas, and even in-store coffee stores. They discovered that the more time visitors spent in the store, the more likely they were to buy.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Amazon has adopted the same approach, allowing visitors to âlook insideâ books.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Imagine that you lost your beloved pet squirrel after letting him off the leash during a walk in a nearby forest. How would you coax him back home to his room? One effective approach (according to the animal advisors we hired for this convoluted analogy) would be to leave a trail of hazelnuts from the forest all the way back to the house.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If you simply left all the hazelnuts in a large pile back at home, then your squirrel wouldnât make the journey. <strong class="calibre2">The plan would work only if you left a trail of evenly spaced, irresistibly high quality hazelnuts from where the squirrel was last seen to where you wanted him to be.</strong></p>
                <p class="calibre4">The Hazelnut Trail is a useful analogy for an effective marketing funnel. Like squirrels, people tend to act based on rewards, especially short-term rewards.

            <p class="calibre4">However, some objections arenât widespread&mdash;they are product-specific. For example, there might be a hundred reasons why a buyer isnât ready to buy customer-relationship-management (CRM) software, and each of the reasons is specific to CRM software. Each objection has to be tackled individually. What can you do if your visitors have tens&mdash;or even hundreds&mdash;of different objections?</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Into the objections column, add all of your visitorsâ objections, as revealed by your research. To make your list more manageable, you may wish to rank the objections by how frequently they get mentioned.</p>

          Step 2: Should you use long or short copy? (Try to reduce how many words you need, by reducing the commitment. And then use as many words as you need.)
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Your website will need to contain <em class="calibre6">at least</em> as many words as youâd use when selling face-to-face.</strong></p>
                <p class="calibre4">But this raises an important point. Selling what? If your company makes customer-relationship-management (CRM) software, you have a wide choice over what you sell at each stage:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">At one extreme, you could aim to complete everything in one step</strong>, selling a three-year enterprise-wide contract for the CRM, with a multimillion-dollar commitment. This may require months of face-to-face meetings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">At the other extreme, you could sell an instant free trial with no credit card required</strong>&mdash;and postpone the rest of the selling to a later stage in your conversion funnel. It may take you no more than a minute of conversation to sell a free trial face-to-face.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">If you ask for less, you donât need to use as many words.</strong> So it pays to explore how you can redesign your conversion funnel so that each step becomes less commitment.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Of all the possible low-commitment steps, lead-generation (or lead-gen) pages deserve a special mention, because they are particularly effective.</strong> A lead-gen page is a page designed to collect the visitorsâ contact details&mdash;often their email addresses. The âsubmit your email addressâ field on a lead-gen page represents a low perceived commitment to the visitor, but a high value to you as a marketer&mdash;because it allows you to lead-nurture the visitor with long copy ad infinitum (or, at least, ad tedium).</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Of course, if you lower the commitment at an early stage, bear in mind that you may have simply deferred the commitment&mdash;and the persuasion required&mdash;to a subsequent stage.</strong> Sometimes a free trial of the product or service does that persuasion well. Also, it allows you to collect visitorâs contact details. Sometimes a free trial doesnât work, though, especially if the product or software unavoidably requires the user to commit time or resources. (Commitments can include money, work, time, and risk.) Beware of suboptimizing a particular page only to discover that the problem pops up further down the funnel. A supermarket could get more customers to the checkout by getting the security guards to drag them there&mdash;or by closing off the rest of the store&mdash;but it wouldnât increase profits.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The most successful online retailers do both: They reduce the commitment required from the buyers by pricing products aggressively low, and then using many words.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">In many situations, itâs most effective to offer a dual path: to provide direct, low-commitment calls to action, plus long copy. Successful software companies often provide a low-commitment way forward (a free trial), plus detailed information for those who would prefer it. The calls to action may be scattered throughout the copy, as in the following image:</p>

          Step 3: How to organize your persuasive copy using âseparation of concernsâ
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">No matter how long your page is, your visitors should be able to easily find the information they need. They shouldnât have to read the whole page from start to end. <strong class="calibre2">A webpage should be long like a phone book, not like a Russian novel.</strong></p>
                <p class="calibre4">Your challenge is thus one of information architecture: How can you organize all the information so that visitors see what they need&mdash;and at the right level of detail&mdash;without getting bored? This is conversion at its hardest. Itâs one of the biggest challenges for many websites. Itâs also extremely fruitful when you get it right. In the following pages, we present some techniques and concepts that donât appear in copywriting books. They will help you a great deal.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">Separation of concerns</em> is a fancy name for when information is organized and encapsulated into modules. The concept is closely related to the phrase âa place for everything and everything in its place.â Separation of concerns is essential when youâre managing a lot of content. For website design, the modules can be paragraphs, page sections, pages, or groups of pages:</p>

                    <p class="img1">The navigation bars of many websites clearly encapsulate the content into <strong class="calibre2">groups of pages</strong>. (<a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/smart-insights-case-study/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">In one of our case studies,</span></a> we describe how we used this technique to increase paid memberships for Smart Insights by 75%.)</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">By modularizing, you allow your visitors to easily find the information that they need, and to ignore the rest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Itâs hard to stress how important it is to organize information into an architecture thatâs easy to navigate. <strong class="calibre2">Once a visitor is lost, itâs difficult to show them counterobjections. Theyâll never find them.</strong></p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Separation of concerns may seem obvious and straightforward, but once a company does it badly, a mess quickly ensues. We are fans of a particular brand of sit-stand desks. However, whenever we recommend them to people, we struggle to find the version we own (there are over twenty variations, each with subtle differences). The problem is common to many e-commerce websites that give each product variation its own page. The visitor has to play a game of spot the difference between different product pages, many of which are almost identical except for a few differences.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Visitors donât want to play spot the difference. If they are buying a laptop, they donât want to browse product names like âABC123-1Tw, ABC123-2Tb, etc.â Instead, they prefer to see headings that reflect their current mindset and that narrow down the choices. They want to be given choices like âDo you want it with a 1 TB or 2 TB hard drive?â and âDo you want it in black or white?â</p>

                    <p class="img1">Thatâs not a store&mdash;itâs a warehouse! This is an example of how an e-commerce page should <em class="calibre6">not</em> look. A product page should help buyers choose between the available options. It shouldnât be just a database dump.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">The following hack is useful if you are unsure of the logic by which your products or services should be sold: Phone the companyâs sales department, and ask an open-ended question like âIâm having trouble choosing which sit-stand desk to buy. Could you help me?â Then notice which questions the sales advisor asks. If they are good, theyâll ask questions that narrow down the choices. If they are great, theyâll have a mental logic tree that elegantly narrows down the choices in as few steps as possible. They almost certainly wonât ask what the website asks: âDo you want Product ABC, Product DEF, or Product GHI?â Only a web marketer would do that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Thereâs one more reason to clearly modularize your content: <strong class="calibre2">If information is hard to find for a visitor, it will also be hard to find for the websiteâs editors. So it will be even more likely to deteriorate over time.</strong> Poor separation of concerns tends to snowball. Some telecoms companiesâ websites are messy to the point of being almost irrecoverably out of control.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Once your information is clearly modularized, you need to make it clear where one module ends and the next starts.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">You can do this using a hierarchy of text sizes and formatting, as we do in this book, using the following techniques:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Headings</strong> (and subheads) clearly show the start of sections (and subsections). However, be aware that readers tend to be less aware of the structure than the writer is. Readers are typically fine with Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles, and tend to be just about okay with Heading 3 styles. By the time a page has reached Heading 4 or below, the readers often struggle to understand where they are in the hierarchy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Paragraph returns</strong> indicate minor changes of topic.</p>

          Step 6: Two ways to improve how you label modules
        
        
      </h3>
                <section id="calibre_link-449" class="level" data-number="6.10.6.1">
    
      <h4 data-number="6.10.6.1" class="calibre21">
        
        
          1. Label each module with a headline thatâs clear and descriptive
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Itâs important to use the right words in a sectionâs heading. Your words should concisely describe the contents of a section in a way that will be obvious to visitors. Unfortunately, many websites fail in this respect. In many websitesâ navigation bars, for example, the headings can be understood only by someone whoâs already familiar with the website. For example, companies often use the names of their products in their navigation bars, even when the names arenât self-explanatory.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">You might find it useful to think of it as âsurprise navigation.â With surprise navigation, you donât know what youâre going to get until youâve got it. Surprise navigation is as pointless as a road sign that canât be understood until youâve arrived at the destination. Itâs generous to even call it navigation; itâs more like an in-joke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Surprise navigation isnât limited to navigation bars; it also appears anywhere that has road sign functionality&mdash;including headlines, subheads, the titles of page sections and other page elements.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Surprise navigation is a common problem; it leads visitors into oblivion, and it kills conversions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">You can eliminate yours by reading all of your headings, including the tabs in your navigation, the headings of pages, and the headings of sections&mdash;and then ensuring that each heading would be understandable to a newcomer. Then, to confirm that you were right, carry out user tests and Treejack tests.</p>

          2. How to fix your headings: Many marketers mistakenly label modules with âcategorizersâ when they should have used âspoilersâ or âteasersâ
        
        
      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">Itâs often not enough for a heading to describe whatâs in the module. It should also tease or spoil.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">So if your page has a section of media testimonials, introduce it with a spoiler headline. That way, you communicate the message even to skim-readers:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Categorization headline:</strong> âMedia mentionsâ (worse)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Teaser headline:</strong> âSee what the press are saying about usâ¦â (a bit better)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Spoiler headline:</strong> âWeâve had rave reviews from TIME, CNN, and many others!â (much better)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">For persuasion, spoiler headlines usually win, because they show the most important information.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">However, if you definitely want the user to click through, use a headline that teases, not spoils:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Categorization headline:</strong> âA video of a kitten pouncing on a hawkâ (worse)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Spoiler headline:</strong> âA kitten pounced on a hawk in a playful way, because they are friendsâ (no better)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="calibre14">
                            <p class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre2">Teaser headline:</strong> âA kitten pounced on a hawk. I was expecting a nasty ending. What happened next was amazing!â (better)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="calibre4">Even many professional copywriters make the mistake of using categorization headlines when they should have used spoiler or teaser headlines:</p>
                    <ul class="calibre13">
                        <li class="calibre14">

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Niching works best in marketplaces that are noisy and overcrowded. By being distinctive, you win a disproportionate amount of attention.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Once you have grown to saturate your niche, though, you need to satisfy more people and needs.</strong> At that point, the winning strategy is to become less niched and more moderate.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">You see this happen during TV talent shows and political campaigns. At the start of a political campaign, a candidate benefits from being extreme. As the campaign progresses, and competitors are eliminated, strategic candidates tend to mellow, sacrificing attention-getting antics in order to appeal to a broader audience.</p>

          Seven ways to spot niching opportunities your competitors will ignore
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">One of the most common mistakes is simply to identify an opportunity, and then aim to capture it. Just because something is an opportunity today doesnât mean itâs worth chasing.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Instead, <strong class="calibre2">look for opportunities that you can seize without a struggle</strong>, because your competitors wonât stop you.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">List your opportunities, and then run them through the following checklist, to identify which of them your competitors are likely to avoid:</strong></p>

                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because <strong class="calibre2">it runs against their strategy, their brand, and what they stand for</strong>: If Rolex was to start making cars, you could predict with reasonable confidence that it would target the luxury end of the market. Rolex would be unlikely to compete with a company that sells low-end cars. If Ikea were to launch a car, on the other hand, you might expect it to be lower priced and more functionally designed. And maybe youâd need to assemble the engine yourself. Ikea would, therefore, be less likely to compete with a company that sells luxury cars.</p>

                        <p class="calibre15">Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because <strong class="calibre2">it would disrupt their existing business</strong>: When Google first made its office software free, it was safe to assume that Microsoft wouldnât do the same. Such a move would have undermined too much of Microsoftâs revenue. In his book <em class="calibre6">The Innovatorâs Dilemma</em>, Clayton Christensen calls this principle <em class="calibre6">dependency</em>. Companies depend on their existing customers, revenue, and investors and are unlikely to upset them.</p>

                        <p class="calibre15">You ideally want to focus on an opportunity that will inevitably grow&mdash;to âskate where the puck is going.â Fortunately, many competitors will avoid such an opportunity because <strong class="calibre2">it isnât big enough yet</strong>. This leaves a gap that you can fill. Even when an opportunity will imminently become large, many competitors will ignore it until it happens.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">Some competitors will avoid an opportunity because <strong class="calibre2">they have a track record of failing at that activity</strong>. Or not even trying. If a company has always failed at something, or has always avoided doing it, you can predict with reasonable confidence that it will continue to do the same. Often, youâll never find out the reasons. Fortunately, you donât need to. For example, when Yahoo! acquires a tech company, you can be reasonably confident that the tech company will no longer be a threat.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Many people agree that they need to focus more. But they think that <em class="calibre6">focus</em> means <em class="calibre6">concentrate</em>. It doesnât. <em class="calibre6">Focus</em> means <em class="calibre6">neglect</em>. As Steve Jobs said, âFocus means saying no to the hundred other good ideas.â Focusing doesnât feel empowering; it feels embarrassing, upsetting, and scary. <strong class="calibre2">A sign that you are focusing is that you frequently cringe at the things you <em class="calibre6">arenât</em> doing.</strong> Your head knows you are doing the right thing, but your stomach turns at the things you are neglecting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">How can you overcome the cringing feeling? Remind yourself that your neglect can be temporary. Once you dominate a particular niche, you can incrementally expand the scope of your business. As Amazon has done. Amazon started by being a bookstore and is heading toward being an everything store.</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">If you see people running out of a building, you would be wise to copy them; maybe the building is on fire. People trust social proof because itâs often a reliable indicator.

                    <p class="calibre4">We tend to behave like those around us, to be liked or accepted. This same instinct can cause marketers to feel a twinge of discomfort every time they stray from the norm. But niching means doing things that others donât. <strong class="calibre2">So next time you feel a twinge of awkwardness because your company is doing something eccentric&mdash;because you are sticking your neck out&mdash;remind yourself that your desire for conformity might be holding you back.</strong></p>

          How some companies build scarcity into their offers
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">In our experience, almost all businesses have genuine scarcity and urgency.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">However, many companies manufacture scarcity and urgency, in the same way that they manufacture their products. Manufacturers of luxury goods, like Rolex, Ferrari, Louis Vuitton, build scarcity into their marketing plans.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Even if the product isnât scarce, the offer can be. Companies like Bose create rolling time-limited offers. For example, Bose might offer free accessories for anyone who orders by the end of the month. But what happens the following month? No more offer? Instead, the offer simply switches to another time-limited offer, which expires at the end of that month. Such offers allow the company to always have a reason for the visitor to act promptly. An extreme example of rolling time-limited offers are daily deals websites.</p>

Shell Oil did this with outrageous success by giving away booklets about motoring. The booklets had titles like âHow you can spot some car problems before they cost big moneyâ and âHow to save gasoline when you buy a car, drive a car, and take care of a car.â The campaign was reported to be Shellâs most successful ever, with three hundred million booklets given away.</p>

After several rounds of iteratively designing and then usability testing, we sent off the much-improved packaging designs to the manufacturer. Several weeks later, when customers started receiving the newly designed travel adapters, the problematic inbound customer calls dropped to zero.</p>

The most successful companies can outbid their competitors in advertising&mdash;not just because they <em class="calibre6">outconvert</em> their competitors, but also because their customers <em class="calibre6">keep returning to spend more</em>. That way, the cost of acquiring a customer can be recouped over the total lifetime of the customer.</p>

          A mindset to maximize LCV
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Does success come to those who deserve it?</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Until recently, the answer was no. But the world is changing quickly, and the answer is moving toward yes. Good people&mdash;and good companies&mdash;are increasingly getting what they deserve. The phrase âIf you build it, they will comeâ used to be a âfalsism.â But the internet has made consumers much better at finding great products and services.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Hereâs an example. In the past, a bad restaurant in a tourist hotspot could prosper by preying on an endless supply of naive customers. Now, thanks to websites like TripAdvisor, prospective diners can find out the truth. So diners go to the best restaurants and they avoid the bad ones. The top-rated restaurants get almost all of the money.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If we ran a restaurant, weâd focus on delivering value&mdash;by cooking great food and making customers happy&mdash;in the firm belief that everything else would look after itself, because the truth would get out.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">If your core value isnât high, youâll get almost no rewards until you become the best available option for your target market&mdash;at which point the rewards come rushing in. Because everyone wants the best. No one goes shopping for their second-best option.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So if you were running a restaurant, youâd want your food and service to be not just good but the best, and youâd want your employees to be not just happy but the happiest, because being best is disproportionately more fruitful than being second, third, or fourth. (Of course, the definition of best requires you to niche to a particular target market and a particular offering; a fast-food restaurant is the best at satisfying particular needs of particular customers.)</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So we advise our clients to âbecome deserving of what you want.â To build a company that deserves to be hugely successful, because itâs the best in the world at delivering value. To focus their efforts on delivering and improving every aspect of their service.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">This isnât just nice-to-hear fluff. Many marketers are attracted to short-term hacks and black-hat secrets. (If you ever go to a conference where one of the talks has a title that mentions sneaky tricks, notice how full the room is.)</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Companies that win at conversion tend to be those that aim to build something great.</p>

          Use Net Promoter Score to improve customer happiness
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">How can you measure whether youâre turning visitors into raving fans? <em class="calibre6">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</em> can be simple and effective. To measure your raving-fan-ness, simply ask your customers the following question: âOn a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?â You then calculate the percentage of respondents who gave scores of 9 or 10 (NPS calls those people âPromotersâ), and then subtract the percentage of respondents who gave scores of 0 to 6 (NPS calls them âDetractorsâ). The theory is that Promoters will grow your business via word of mouth and that Detractors will shrink your business via word of mouth. An NPS of +100 would mean that every customer would be a raving fan, evangelizing you wherever they go. An NPS of &ndash;100 would mean the opposite, that every customer is out there complaining. NPS isnât just useful as a metric; itâs useful as a concept. An NPS of +100 is a guiding star that every team member can envisage and strive for.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Your raving fans are likely to make subsequent purchases, and they are likely to recommend you to their friends.</p>

(More accurately, he was the person <em class="calibre6">least reluctant</em> to get one.) Ben had many insights during the buying process. One of the more interesting insights came once the shed was delivered to the front of his house. Ben discovered that the shedâs components would not fit easily through a standard doorway. They scraped the paint off the houseâs door frame. Based on this feedback, our client redesigned all its sheds so that no component was too large to fit through a doorway. This improved the clientâs customer feedback rating, which was already high.</p>

      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Before we made any changes on the website, <strong class="calibre2">we listened to what the visitors were telling us</strong>. Because goHenryâs visitors were on mobile devices, <strong class="calibre2">we listened to what the <em class="calibre6">mobile</em> visitors were telling us.</strong> It sounds obvious, but itâs often overlooked&mdash;even by companies with sophisticated mobile websites.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre2">Donât assume that your mobile visitors are just desktop visitors on a different device.</strong> If you do, youâll focus on the user interface as the only difference between the two.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">In fact&mdash;as we discovered when we gathered data on goHenryâs visitors&mdash;mobile users can have very different intentions, likes, and objections to their desktop counterparts. Youâll need to address these specifically on your mobile journey.</p>

      </h4>
                    <p class="calibre4">The difference between mobile users and desktop users isnât just about screen size. Mobile users are more likely to have arrived from a social network, so they were different in the following respects:</p>

                    <p class="calibre4">Our mobile visitors were intrigued but had many strong objections&mdash;as you would expect when selling a new financial product for children.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">A long page allows us to systematically address all of the key objections, starting with the strongest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Then, as each objection was addressed, we gave the prospect an opportunity to proceed through the funnel by sprinkling the âcall to actionâ throughout the page. This effectively made the page as short as possible&mdash;but as long as necessary. This was particularly important on mobile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">Thereâs no such thing as a too-long page&mdash;only a too-boring one. So we had to ensure that the page was engaging from top to bottom.</p>

          We created an 8% uplift in card activations from optimizing the postsale pages
        
        
      </h3>
                <p class="calibre4">Having made a huge impact increasing sign-ups, we turned our attention to the activation funnel. When a childâs card arrives in the mail, the parent must first activate it before it can be used. This stage is crucial for goHenry; each unactivated card is wasted money.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Before we began optimizing the card-activation stage, we carried out dedicated usability studies. The studies revealed two main issues:</p>
                <ul class="calibre13">
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">The activation process began with the standard member log-in screen. Many parents didnât consider themselves members at this point, so werenât sure they were in the right place.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="calibre14">
                        <p class="calibre15">There were several âcognitive barriersâ on the journey, things that made members stop and think, diverting attention from the task at hand.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="calibre4">When we designed a new funnel to address these issues, card activations increased by 8%.</p>

          We created an 11% uplift in card activations from optimizing the offline journey

                <p class="calibre4">Donât just limit optimization to your website. If part of your journey happens offline, optimize that too.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Thatâs exactly what we did with goHenryâs card activation journey.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Our research told us that half of the children knew about the card before it arrived in the mail. Now, if youâve got kids youâll know how persuasive they can be, so it came as no surprise that parents were more likely to activate when their child knew about the card.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">It followed that if we could make more kids aware of the card, more cards would be activated.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">So we sent the welcome letter to the kids instead. After all, the purpose of goHenry is to teach children financial responsibility.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">The result? Card activations increased by 11%.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">If, like goHenry, youâre working in financial services&mdash;or any tightly regulated vertical&mdash;youâll need to work closely with risk and compliance teams. This can be a major bottleneck in getting your ideas approved. Where possible, submit your ideas in âbite-sizeâ chunks, each with a mini-business case. Complexity in these submissions can otherwise be crippling. Such âmicro-approvalsâ are less onerous and much more likely to succeed.</p>

                <p class="calibre4">We are now working on the goHenry app itself, aiming to drive engagement and referrals.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">On the website, weâre working on the sign-up funnel, as well as other key parts of the journey such as forgotten password and referrals.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Once complete, we will have rebuilt the entire website.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">Whatâs unusual about this rebuild is that it has been done iteratively, and with conversion at the heart of every decision. Conversion, by definition, is <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/useless/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">the reason that any website exists</span></a>.</p>

          <strong class="calibre2">More praise from clients</strong> who have implemented the advice in this book
        
        
      </h2>
            <p class="calibre4">At the start of this book, we included quotes taken from <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/clients-and-results/" class="calibre8 pcalibre7 pcalibre6 pcalibre5 pcalibre4"><span class="underline1">our website</span></a> from clients weâve helped over the last ten years. Here are more inspiring examples</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âConversion Rate Experts were looking for monumental wins, and suggested big changes across our business. They recommended, and helped us to build, what became the second-busiest financial community in the UK.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">money.co.uk</strong>, one of the UKâs most popular financial comparison websites.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThey passed amazing amounts of knowledge off to our team and inspired our team with their enthusiasm and passion for what they do. Weâve even had some product test pages where theyâve converted 100% better than the previous page.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Cogeco Peer 1 Hosting</strong>, one of the worldâs top-five hosting providers, hosting more than one percent of the internet.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âWe gained confidence about making big changes because CRE told us that itâs the big changes that would have the big impact.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">TopCashback</strong>, which we have helped to be the fifth-fastest-growing company in the UK, growing sales by 2,600% (thatâs 27 times) in three years.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âEach percentage point of conversion is very, very important to us and worth a lot of money. Great fun, great results, great return on investment.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">888.com</strong>, the high-profile gaming website.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThey helped us get our CRO program off the ground. We now have a much deeper understanding of some of the key customer pain points and, more importantly, a well-defined road map on how to address them.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Hertz</strong>, the car-rental company with locations in 150 countries.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âIt was a professional dream come true for me to have worked with them. In some of the places like the top of the funnel, we almost doubled our conversion rates. Itâs helped all of us on the team get better at what we do.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">TINYpulse</strong>, an online B2B software platform for engaging employees.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âConversion rate is the fastest, easiest way to see an increase in your business. The conversion rate was originally less than 5%, and Conversion Rate Experts increased it to 20%&ndash;25%.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Voices.com</strong>, a leading recruitment platform for voice-over artists, having a user base of over 200,000 individuals and companies.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">363% increase in conversion rate for <strong class="calibre2">Crazy Egg</strong>, the leading click-mapping platform. âInstead of saying, âWe want to do this, or we want to do that, or I think this would be best for the business,â they got data to back up their decisions and they did that. Which is why we had such a substantial lift.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Neil Patel</strong>, founder. âThey focused on understanding our customers. We believe that led to the increase in conversions.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Hiten Shah</strong>, founder.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">63% increase in sales for <strong class="calibre2">Morphsuits</strong>, the fancy dress company that became the UKâs 18th fastest growing company. âWe know, when weâre thinking about making changes, that anything that theyâre suggesting is backed up by the data.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Morphsuits</strong></p>
            <p class="calibre4">âIf you donât have a solid conversion rate plan, I would definitely advise you to get in touch with Conversion Rate Experts.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Dell</strong>, the multinational computer technology company.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âConversion Rate Experts are by far and away the number one in the world. They have helped us transform our business and our processes around testing. As a direct result of working with Conversion Rate Experts, weâve doubled our revenue.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">HomeFinder</strong>, a leading real-estate website.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âI went into this project fairly skeptical that weâd be able to achieve a 30%+ improvement. At 50%+, it far exceeded our expectations.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">AAG</strong>, America's largest provider of government-insured reverse mortgages.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âWorking with Conversion Rate Experts has been extremely stunning in terms of results. Itâs definitely driving a lot of revenue.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Xero</strong>, the disruptive cloud software company.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThe decision making process is based on real data, tested data, rather than just gut feeling. The results that weâve achieved have been very impressive.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Companies Made Simple</strong>, the company formation service that has created over half a million companies.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThe work that weâve done with Conversion Rate Experts has resulted in additional revenue of around Â£1 million per year. Itâs been a huge learning experience for the entire team. I wish we had done it a lot earlier.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Health Express</strong>, an online clinic.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âSales have increased from Â£16 million to Â£31 million per year.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Sunshine.co.uk</strong>, an online travel operator.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThey are brilliant. The results speak for themselves. Sales nearly tripled.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Broadband.co.uk</strong>, a leading comparison website for broadband services.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThe results have been great.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">FreestyleXtreme</strong>, âEarth's largest action-sports store.â</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThey show you how to increase your conversion rate in a structured, analytical and scientific manner. On some of our online shop pages, we increased our conversion rate by up to 100%.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">DefShop</strong>, one of Europeâs leading online hip-hop clothing retailers.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âThe results have been exceptional.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Pritikin</strong>, a weight-loss company.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âSales doubled. Theyâve instilled a testing culture within our company.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">PhotoShelter</strong>, a worldwide leader in photography portfolio websites.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âWeâve been really pleased with our experience with Conversion Rate Experts. Weâve seen uplift in the order of 50%, 60%, even up to 100% for some of the individual tests.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">Dr Dave Chaffey</strong>, <strong class="calibre2">Smart Insights</strong>, a marketing authority website that helps marketers to plan, manage and optimize their marketing.</p>
            <p class="calibre4">âSome of our senior executives didnât understand how CRO could have such a big financial impact. CRE understands our pain, our industry, and our visitorsâ frustrations. One test alone gave a 44% increase.â &mdash;<strong class="calibre2">The Foundry</strong>, a visual-effects software company whose clients include Pixar, ILM, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Sony Pictures Imageworks.</p>
