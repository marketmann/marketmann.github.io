        <p>All packed into the luxurious living room of a Los Angeles mansion... </p>
        <p>The exclusive guests of one Hollywoodâs most powerful men.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, it was a historic event.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it was also a private, invite-only affair... <em><u>with a million-dollar price tag.</u></em></p>
        <p>Because at the center of the room, a <strong>Nobel Prize winning scientist </strong>spoke freely,&nbsp; revealing the jaw-dropping details of her latest discovery...<strong></strong></p>
      <h3>
        
        
          The single most important cause of human aging...<br>
            and a <em><u>safe, clinically-validated</u></em> way to<br>
            PERMANENTLY ALTER THE AGING PROCESS
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>Itâs true.</p>
        <p>Information I recently obtained from a confidential source in Hollywood confirms it.</p>
        <p>After a legendary career...</p>
        <p>Spanning nearly 50 years of innovation...</p>
        <p>This world-famous scientist was invited to this closed-door meeting to reveal her greatest discovery yet. </p>
        <p>The true root cause of human aging... </p>
        <p><strong>And a safe, painless way <em><u>anyone can reverse the process</u>.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Groundbreaking research proves it too.</p>
        <p>Astonished researchers from the University of Minnesota, the University of Utah,<em> <u>and</u></em> the Nobel Prize Committee have now validated her secret.</p>
        <p>The top doctor at the Harvard Medical School is on record saying this breakthrough is capable of a â<em>remarkable reversal of many of the signs and symptoms of aging</em>â</p>
        <p>And even Dr. Dean Ornish... </p>
        <p>...best-selling author, medical advisor to multiple Presidents, and
            the chairman of a a secretive Silicon Valley health initiative called
            GHAC... </p>
        <p>...gave this miracle his official stamp of approval.</p>
        <p>Now, many of the rich and famous - including the power players in
            the room that day - are paying extreme sums of money to look and feel
            better than ever by tapping into this technological fountain of youth. </p>

        <ul class="bullets" style="margin-top:30px;">
            <li><strong>Christie Brinkley</strong> recently made a confession in <strong><em>Forbes</em></strong> magazine that suggests this breakthrough is the cornerstone of the anti-aging strategy that landed her in the <strong><em>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition</em></strong><u> at age 63</u>.</li>
            <li>Late last year, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> - the CEO of Amazon who recently became the richest man in the world - admitted he planned to spend a <em>few million dollars</em> on this breakthrough.&nbsp; Within months, his transformation from middle-aged, skinny geek to strapping stud was so profound <u>it went viral on Twitter</u>.</li>
            <li>And a recent publication suggested this is the reason <strong>Will Smith</strong> and <strong>Halle Berry</strong> look almost exactly the same today (around age 50) as they did in their 20s.</li>

        <p>You see: the woman speaking at the center of that room was Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn.</p>
        <p>And in the world of anti-aging science, Dr. Blackburn is widely considered one of the fieldâs leading medical minds.</p>
        <p>A geneticist by training, Blackburn was educated at two of the

        <p>After finishing school, the young doctor wasted no time forging her

            using this incredible peptide molecule
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>When it comes to looking and feeling great again, the molecule Dr. Blackburn revealed that evening... </p>
        <p>...which youâre about to <u>see</u> first-hand... </p>
        <p><strong><em>...is the âholy grail.â</em></strong></p>
        <p>It flies smack in the face of everything weâve ever heard about growing old. </p>
        <p>The key to aging well isnât your heart, your brain, or your immune system.</p>
        <p>Itâs not collagen... stem cells... or anything like that.</p>
        <p>Itâs not your hormones.</p>
        <p>(And itâs definitely not the dangerous drugs Big Pharma pushes on us.)</p>
        <p>Itâs this incredible molecule.&nbsp; And when you have it, all those other things return to a youthful state as well.</p>
        <p>Imagine it...</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Joints and muscles that feel great... and perform even better.</li>
            <li>So much stamina itâs easy to run laps around your grandkids... <em>and circles around your younger coworkers.</em></li>
            <li>Skin and hair so smooth, soft, and healthy you often get mistaken as 10 years younger than you actually are.</li>
            <li>Eyes like hawk.</li>
            <li>A sharper mind... a trimmer body... a brighter mood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so much more.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Thatâs not all. </p>
        <p>This discovery is also linked to reduced risk of Alzheimerâs,
            cancer, diabetes, heart disease â and to a longer total lifespan.</p>
        <p>Which is probably why the richest people in America are now clamoring to âgrow youngerâ with these cutting edge methods... </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Peter Thiel </strong>- the founder of PayPal - spent millions backing cellular anti-aging and now declares he plans on living to be 120 years old.</li>
            <li><strong>Norman Lear</strong> - the legendary TV producer behind shows such as the <em>All in the Family</em> and <em>The Jeffersons </em>-
                personally invited Dr. Blackburn to his home to learn her
                secrets.&nbsp; At age 95, Lear is determined to continue producing

      </h3>
        <p>Itâs like hitting the pause button on the aging of your body... from the inside out.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In fact, research just out of the University of Alabama shows once
            this unbelievable molecule enters a cell, that cell becomes immortal.</p>
        <p>As lead researcher Dr. T. Tollefsbol boasted... <strong>â<em>We can make cells <u>live forever</u>.â </em></strong></p>
        <p>Whatâs most amazing is how safe, simple, and inexpensive it is.</p>

        <p>Donât expect to hear about it from your doctor or on TV.</p>
        <p>Your doctor is buried under too much Obamacare insurance paperwork to stay on the cusp...</p>
        <p>The Hollywood celebrities and Silicon Valley tech moguls who discovered this secret first practically <strong><em>swore an oath</em></strong> to keep it a secret. </p>
        <p>And you certainly wonât hear about it from mainstream sources. </p>
        <p>You and I both know <strong>Big Pharma </strong>controls the media
            and would never allow a story to see the light of day if it could help

            extension...</p>
        <p>Although itâs now my lifeâs mission, to be honest, I never set out to make a career out of this.</p>
        <p><strong><em>It was forced upon me</em></strong>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You see: I was raised by my single mother.&nbsp; My father died when
            I was young, so for most of my childhood, she was the only parent I
            had.</p>
        <p>She sacrificed a lot so I could grow up safe, healthy, and cared for.</p>
        <p>And it allowed me to go to college, and then on to a highly successful publishing career in New York City.</p>
        <p>With my career soaring, I began dreaming about spending more time with her again. </p>
        <p>Watching her play with her grandchilden. </p>
        <p>Enjoying the holidays with the rest of the family in the home where I grew up.</p>
        <p>Spending long weekends together with my Mom, two avid readers talking about the books weâd read.<strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>
        <p>It wasnât long before the universe punched me straight to the gut.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Slowly, Mom started to fade...</p>
        <p>Like many older Americans, with each year her mind and her body failed her, and her quality of life went to the pits.</p>
        <p>Unable to care for herself.</p>
        <p>Dependent on others for small and mundane daily tasks.</p>
        <p>Mentally and physically, she faded.&nbsp; A shadow of her former self. </p>
        <p>All the money I had... everything I worked for... </p>
        <p><strong><em>It all seemed so hollow when I realized I was losing her
                    and there was nothing I could do. That weâd never share the good life
                    sheâd worked hard to give me - and that I now had. </em></strong></p>
        <p>Every doctor told us the same story. </p>
        <p>This is the way it is when you get old. Thereâs nothing else to do. </p>
        <p>The truth was hard to swallow:</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          The Medical Establishment has added<br>
            years to our lives... yet for most...<br>

      </h3>
        <p><em>Is that a life worth living?</em></p>
        <p>I watched my mom die like that.&nbsp; A victim of her own
            longevity.&nbsp; And as much as I wanted to remember the strong,
            capable woman who raised me...</p>
        <p>...for the longest time, all I actually remembered was the <em>elderly, unhappy</em> woman she became.</p>
        <p>I thought Iâd never heal from that wound.</p>
        <p>Then... once I finished mourning... <em>I had an epiphany</em>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>I could heal my wounds... by helping others avoid the same fate.</strong></p>
        <p>So I took my money and spearheaded an anti-aging research complex.
            It became my personal mission to help all Americans enjoy their Golden
            Years <strong><em>free from pain, fatigue, and disease</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>To restore their quality of life and add years to their lives.</p>

        <p>In 2009 it was all over the news.&nbsp; The discovery of something called a âtelomere.â</p>
        <p>To put it simply: inside your cells, you have these so-called telomeres. </p>
        <p>Each one is like a chain, made up of about 8,000 links.</p>
        <p>As you age, the chain loses links and gets shorter. </p>
        <p>When that happens you start looking and feeling older.</p>

        <p>Studies show this process of telomere shrinkage is closely linked to <strong><em><u>nearly every common age-related disease... even cancer, Alzheimerâs, and heart disease...</u></em></strong></p>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/table.png" class="center-pic" width="747" height="556">
        <p>Thereâs no doubt about it now.&nbsp; Stopping your telomeres from
            getting shorter goes hand-in-hand with enjoying a life of health,
            happiness, and longevity. A fact now recognized by the Nobel Committee
            and our own National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>As the renowned Dr. Blackburn herself recently said...</p>

        <p><span class="highlighttext-quote"><strong><em>"Weâve found that the better your telomeres are protected, the less your chance of getting any of the big diseases."</em></strong></span></p>

        <p>Meanwhile, a recent study at the University of Utah found long telomeres are directly linked to living a long life...</p>
        <p>While people whose telomeres get significantly shorter are <em>TWICE</em> as likely to die!</p>
        <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have now confirmed people who
            get cancer have telomeres about 15 years âolder and shorterâ than
            those of healthy people...</p>
        <p>And the telomeres of people with dementia are about 10 years âolder and shorter.â</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Yet hereâs the <u>problem</u><br>
            (and the really exciting part too)
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>Despite the hype in 2009, the problem with the discovery of
            telomeres was it didnât give us a way to actually halt the effects of
            aging.</p>
        <p>Yes, we learned that the most likely people to live to 90 or beyond... <u>in good shape, getting around, and enjoying life</u>...</p>
        <p>...are the ones whose telomeres didnât get significantly shorter.</p>
        <p><strong>But we still didnât know <u>how to stop it from happening</u> (or better yet, how to make them long again).</strong></p>
        <p><em><u>Thatâs the exciting part.</u></em></p>
        <p>Because Dr. Blackburn has now cracked the code... an incredible way <strong>to <u>regrow</u> human telomeres and <em>literally rewind your bodyâs age <u>at the cellular level</u></em></strong><em>.</em></p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Her solution is an elusive molecule<br>
            called the âTRT Peptideâ
        
        
      </h3>




        <p>Best-selling author Dr. Joseph Mercola proclaimed it stands to revolutionize the way people grow old, calling it...</p>
        <p style="margin-left:60px;"><strong><em>The most exciting and viable
                    possibility for extreme life extension... The kind of anti-aging
                    strategy that can actually allow you to regenerate and in effect âgrow
                    younger.â</em></strong></p>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-trt-peptide.jpg" class="left-pic" style="margin-top:10px;" width="402" height="302">You see: the first thing the TRT molecule does inside your body is to make its way into each of your cells.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It then <u>attaches itself</u> to your DNA, where it can access your genetic code.</p>
        <p>What happens next is absolutely incredible.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>Do you remember how I said each of your telomeres is like a
                chain? And the more links you have in the chain, the âyoungerâ you look
                and feel?&nbsp; </strong></p>
        <p>Well, check this out...</p>
        <p>After accessing your genetic code, the TRT Peptide then <em>reprograms it</em> back to the condition it was in when you were young.</p>
        <p>The cell then responds by <em><u>adding those chain-like links back to your telomere</u></em><u>s</u>.</p>
        <p>And then, picture this: with longer telomeres from head to toe, your
            entire body begins to reverse in age, back to its younger self... like
            you stepped into a time machine.</p>
        <p>Even more incredible: the TRT Peptide isnât some foreign substance
            like a drug or a steroid.&nbsp; Itâs safe and natural. In fact...</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Your body produces it <u>naturally</u><em>...<br>
                and you now have a safe way to turn it back on</em>
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>You see: the reason we start to feel old is because our bodies shut off the production of this molecule as we get older.</p>
        <p>No one knows why this happens.</p>
        <p>The great news is we donât need to. </p>
        <p>Because weâve uncovered a way to turn it back on, and <strong><u>the results are astonishing</u>. </strong></p>
        <p>The TRT Peptide is so unimaginably powerful Iâm not talking about <em>slowing down</em> or even <em>freezing</em> the aging process...</p>
        <p><strong><em>But reversing it</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>Research shows that, on the average, people are seeing the
            anti-aging, telomere-extending equivalent of eight and a half extra
            yearsâ¦for some folks as much as 20, 23, even 27 years!
        </p>
        <p>This is brand new research, published in September 2018. One of the very first human clinical trials of its kind. </p>
        <p>Itâs so new, in fact, that weâre still trying to wrap our minds around the implications. </p>
        <p>Just to be clear â Iâm not talking about drawing out the âend of
            lifeâ death-spiral of aging, sickness, and disease over an additional 20
            years. </p>
        <p>Who wants that? </p>
        <p>This study proves possible adding another two decades of<em> healthy, vibrant independent living</em> may be within reach of the âaverage Joeâ like you and me! </p>
        <p>A bold claim, I know. But this research isn't coming out of left field...</p>
        <p>Because when I first began my research into life extension in 2015, I
            came across a breathtaking study conducted by world-renowned Harvard
            researcher Dr. Ronald DePinho.</p>
        <p>Working with a group of lab mice, Dr. DePinho engineered a way to completely turn off the TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the mice got very old, very fast.</p>
        <p>Their fur turned grey. </p>
        <p>Their brains got smaller and slower. </p>
        <p>They lost their sense of smell. </p>
        <p>Their digestion became poor.</p>
        <p>Exactly what happens to humans as they get older and lose their TRT Peptide.</p>
        <p>Then... Dr. DePinho <u>reactivated</u> the TRT Peptide inside each of these mice.</p>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img-trt-mice.jpg" class="right-pic" width="412" height="266">What happened next sent shockwaves through the medical community.</p>
        <p><strong><em><u>They aged âbackwardsâ</u></em></strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>All signs of old age... vanished.</p>
        <p>Their thinning, grey fur was revived... dark, full, and lustrous.</p>
        <p>Their shriveling, slow brains got smarter and faster.</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Once their TRT Peptide was turned back on,<br>
            they grew so young they returned to<br>
            their physical primes... 
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>They even started mating and building families again.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>In side-by-side comparisons, these mice were <u>completely indistinguishable</u> from young mice.</p>
        <p>Had they been humans, they would have been labeled as âelderlyâ and âsenile.â <br>
            Yet with their natural production of TRT Peptide turned back on, they went back in time... </p>
        <p><em>...and stayed there.</em></p>
        <p>Maybe youâre thinkingâ¦ âIâm not a lab rat.â </p>
        <p>Of course not.</p>
        <p>And everybody knows results in the lab arenât the same thing as real world results.</p>
        <p>Thatâs why the recent human study I mentioned above is such a game-changer (more on that in a minute)â¦
        </p>
        <p>First, let me share with you what real people in the real world have experienced with TRT Peptide... </p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          This is the first thing youâll probably notice when you reactivate
            your natural production of the TRT Peptide... and begin repairing your
            telomeres for the first time in decades...
        
        
      </h3>
        <p><strong>Practically everyone over the age of 50 describes the rejuvenation they experience the same way: â<em>I</em> <em>feel better <u>overall</u>.â</em></strong></p>
        <p>It sounds vague... </p>
        <p><strong>Yet if youâre getting older, you know <u>EXACTLY</u> what they mean.</strong></p>
        <p>Itâs that top-to-bottom, all-over feeling of being in your prime again... and not headed downhill fast.</p>
        <p>Of being healthy from head to toe, inside and out.</p>
        <p>Of having a body that works <em>wonderfully</em>... instead of struggling to âget by.â</p>
        <p>Just take a look at how people react after first regrowing their telomeres....</p>

        <p>You see: after I discovered the unbelievable powers of the TRT

        <p>I couldnât accept that.&nbsp; So I set out to discover a way to bring this science to as many people as possible...</p>
        <p>Not just the <u>privileged few</u> who have the money and connections to get it.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It became the #1 focus of my team of anti-aging researchers.</p>
        <p>After analyzing the research on <em>thousands</em> of potential compounds...</p>
        <p>We identified about 40 that are proven to reactivate your bodyâs production of the TRT Peptide.</p>

      </h4>
        <p>Remember that human trial I hinted at just a few minutes ago? </p>
        <p>This supernutrient, Telos95, is so powerful , a one-year, randomized <u>human</u> study, conducted by Princeton Consumer Research in 2018, PROVED that subjects taking the key supernutrient in Genesis <em>reversed their biological age by as much as 27 years.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Their telomere length grew on average the equivalent of eight and a half yearsâ¦YOUNGER. </strong></p>
        <p>After taking this amazing nutrient for just six months, some of the

        <p>Imagine, six months from now, looking and feeling as much as 27 years younger than your actual age.</p>
        <p>The first glimmer of hope for Telos95 came from a study at Europeâs renowned <strong><em>Life Length Laboratories</em></strong>...</p>

        <p>The results were out of this world. Hereâs what happened:</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the study, the researchers created two test groups.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>One that received Telos95... </p>
        <p>One that didnât.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, at the end of the study... when the two groups were compared to one another...</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          The telomeres of the group that got Telos95<br>
            were <em><u>20% longer</u></em> than the telomeres of the group that got nothing
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>This was a staggering result.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the results of these two studies have shaken the research community to the core.</p>
        <p>By some estimatesâ¦ </p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Thatâs like <em>rewinding</em> your age by up to 27 years... and then keeping it there... FOR GOOD!
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>It sounds impossible, but with Telos95, itâs fact.</p>
        <p>Of course, these results happened under strict lab conditions, so I canât promise youâll get a transformation this profound...</p>
        <p>Yet imagine what your life will be like if your results were even <u>half this good</u>.</p>
        <p>How much better youâd feel... </p>
        <p>How much healthier youâd be... </p>

      </h3>
        <p>Quite a lot, Iâm sure.&nbsp; And believe me: itâd be worth every penny.</p>
        <p>Yet, how does paying ZERO sound?</p>
        <p>Keep reading and Iâll show you how - on this page only - you can get a two-month supply of <strong>Genesis, </strong><em><u>without paying today and with no risk or obligation whatsoever</u></em>.</p>
        <p>First, let me tell you a little bit more about what you can expect
            when you reactivate your bodyâs natural production of the TRT Peptide
            and <em>regrow</em> your telomeres with <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>
        <p>I already told you about the fast-acting benefits youâll first experience with <strong>Genesis</strong>...</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Energy to get through the longest of days, without the afternoon crash</li>
            <li>Durable, healthy joints so smooth, youâll swear theyâre brand new</li>
            <li>The physical stamina to do the activities you love again, without paying for it the next day</li>
            <li>A razor-sharp mind that helps you get more done each day, so effortless, itâs like youâre on autopilot</li>
            <li>And because of these things, people will <strong>treat you differently again,</strong> like they did when you were young and strong</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may even find youâre getting deeper, more restful sleep and
            consistently enjoying a better mood and better sense of well-being.</p>
        <p>Of course, thereâs evidence the <strong>Genesis</strong> formula helps people who suffer from poor sleep, but I think it goes deeper than that... </p>
        <p>My guess is people who take <strong>Genesis </strong>rest easy because they donât worry about getting sick or handicapped any longer.</p>
        <p>And when the weight of all that worry gets lifted from their shoulders, they can sleep peacefully for the first time in years.</p>
        <p>I also wouldnât be surprised if you trimmed up around your waist
            because your metabolism speeds up, and youâre more active each day.</p>
        <p>Yet thereâs so much more.</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          Now that thousands of our early customers have been taking Genesis
            for months, weâve got a good idea of the long-term benefits too
        
        
      </h3>
        <p><strong><em>And theyâre spectacular.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Because after a month or two, most people are thrilled how repairing their cells <em><u>from the inside</u></em> makes them look fantastic <em><u>on the outside</u></em>. </p>
        <p>Youâll know it when it happens because...&nbsp; </p>

        <p>You probably remember it well.&nbsp; Healthy, vitalized skin that felt good and looked great.</p>
        <p>Get ready, because those days are back.</p>
        <p>If your skin is wrinkled, dehydrated, and rough... </p>
        <p>Especially on your face, neck, and hands...</p>
        <p>And no amount of cream or lotion has brought it back to life...</p>
        <p>The âTotal Cellular Transformationâ you get with <strong>Genesis</strong> could be the solution youâve been looking for.</p>
        <p>Stick with <strong>Genesis</strong> for the long-term... </p>
        <p><strong>And I guarantee youâll notice the difference. </strong>&nbsp;Youâll
            look brighter, fresher, and younger... and friends and neighbors may
            even pull you aside to ask what youâre doing different.</p>
        <p>The research proves it.</p>
        <p>Longer telomeres donât just safeguard your body against the age-related sickness...</p>
        <p>They donât just give you more energy and mental clarity, and make your joints and muscles strong and capable again... </p>
        <p>They donât just increase your chances of living into your 80s, 90s, or beyond <strong><em><u>in full health</u></em></strong>... </p>
        <p>When you have long telomeres, you look younger too!</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          A recent study published by the British Medical Journal confirms the longer your telomeres, the younger people judge you to be
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>This effect is so powerful, it applies to identical twins.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>You see: when study participants were asked to compare<em> <u>identical twins</u>, </em>the twin with the longer telomeres was judged to be <strong>significantly younger</strong>...</p>
        <p><u>With fewer fine lines and wrinkles and a much healthier complexion.</u><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
        <p>Since identical twins have the exact same genes, the bottom line is simply this: </p>
        <p>People with long telomeres look significantly younger than people with short telomeres...</p>
        <p><em>...no matter what kind of genes they have</em>.</p>
        <p>If you remember, thatâs because the way the TRT Peptide works is by <em><u>latching itself to your DNA</u></em> and <em><u>reprogramming your genes</u></em> to a younger state. </p>
        <p>And only <strong>Genesis</strong> was specifically designed to do it. </p>
        <p>Incredible right? </p>
        <p>Yet my team set out to create a SYNERGISTIC formula.&nbsp; Unrivaled and unmatched in its power to regrow your telomeres.</p>

      </h4>
        <p><img src="../../../assets/images/Genesis_files/img12.jpg" class="right-pic" width="400" height="250">It
            may look like tree bark but itâs actually a powerful supernutrient
            extracted from the roots of an odd Chinese plant called the Astragalus
            flower.</p>
        <p>And a groundbreaking paper published in the journal <em>Rejuvenation Research</em>
            revealed that despite its strange appearance, this next-generation
            supernutrient could be one of the most important anti-aging
            breakthroughs in recent memory.</p>
        <p>You see: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the
            researchers took two groups of people between the ages of 53 and 87. </p>
        <p>One group got nothing, a placebo.</p>
        <p>The other group got cycloastragenol.</p>
        <p>Remember how I said your telomeres are like a chain?</p>
        <p>Well, itâs a well-established fact that AGING is the process of the
            chain being reduced from 8,000 links to about 5,000 links.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Thatâs it.&nbsp; Just 3,000 links separate a healthy and fit 20-year-old from an old and senile 90-year-old.</p>
        <p>Well, one year later, the researchers measured each groupâs telomeres.</p>
        <p>As expected, in this study, the placebo group got older, weaker, and slower.</p>
        <p>Their telomeres lost about 290 links on average.</p>
        <p>Thatâs almost 10% of their lifeâs supply, gone in a year.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the cycloastragenol group actually <em>gained</em> an average of 530 links per person. </p>
        <p>Can you believe it? </p>
        <p>Further studies indicate it happens because cycloastragenol increases your bodyâs natural production of TRT Peptide by <strong><em><u>200% or more</u></em></strong></p>
        <p>We were so blown away by what we saw, several of my researchers
            suggested we create a formula that consisted of just this and nothing
            else.</p>
        <p>Yet when we evaluated the potential of combining cycloastragenol
            with Telos95, we knew we were onto something.&nbsp; A potent 1-2 punch
            that increases your bodyâs production of the TRT Peptide <u>in two different ways</u>.</p>
        <p>Itâs really getting good now, isnât it? Letâs keep going...</p>

        <p>A lot of people call it ALA. Maybe youâve heard of it before. For
            good reason too.&nbsp; Itâs one of the most powerful nutrients you can
            put in your body.</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>It helps support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol</li>

            <li>It even helps your eyes, ears, and bones stay strong as you get older</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And only Genesis has a synergistic formula that combines ALA with Telos95 and cycloastragenol...</p>
        <p>Hereâs why thatâs really exciting: </p>
        <p><strong>Doctors at the Emory School of Medicine recently concluded ALA specifically targets and lengthens the telomeres in your heart!</strong></p>
        <p>So while your peers are huffing-and-puffing and worrying themselves sick because their hearts canât keep up...</p>
        <p>Youâll rest easy knowing your heart is actually getting younger and more powerful each day thanks to <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thatâs one... two... three different mechanisms <strong>Genesis </strong>uses to regrow your telomeres.&nbsp; </p>

        <p><em>Unless you combine it with Vitamin K2.</em></p>

            formula with this potent double-shot of vitamins goes beyond the
            benefits of taking them alone.</p>
        <p>Because we now have evidence that adding Vitamin D3/K2 to <strong>Genesis</strong> further enhances the telomere-lengthening powers of our formula.</p>
        <p>In fact, <em>in two different studies </em>conducted at Harvard and the London School of Medicine...</p>
        <p>More than 4,400 people were tested...</p>
        <p>And this potent vitamin combo was directly responsible for adding a <em><u>minimum of five years</u></em> back to their telomeres.</p>

        <p><strong>PS - Still here? Great. Maybe you have a few questions.</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some of the most common ones our customers ask...</p>
    
      <h3>
        
        
          What kind of results can I expect from Genesis?
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>I like to place results possible with <strong>Genesis</strong> into three buckets.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>First, youâll feel a lot better overall.&nbsp; More energy, fewer
            aches and pains, deeper sleep, clearer thoughts, less
            inflammation.&nbsp; Think back a decade or two... <em>thatâs how youâll feel again.</em></p>
        <p>Second is looking better.&nbsp; A brighter, healthier looking face
            and skin.&nbsp; Combine that with moving and feeling better... and
            youâll be shocked how people suddenly stop treating you like youâre â<em>elderly</em>.â</p>
        <p>Finally, Iâm confident taking <strong>Genesis</strong> will add years of functional, capable, <em>high-quality</em>
            time to your life.&nbsp; The combination of long telomeres and
            healthy mitochondria is, in my opinion, the secret to increasing your
            lifespan... <em>while</em>... feeling like someone half your age <strong>so you have a life worth living</strong>.</p>
        <p>It doesnât matter if youâre in great shape or terrible shape, if you have great genes or rotten ones... <strong>Genesis</strong> <u>will</u> work for you. Guaranteed.</p>

          Is it possible for something this<br>
            powerful to be safe?<br>
            What are the side effects?
        
        
      </h3>
        <p>Point blank: there are no side effects with <strong>Genesis</strong>. Itâs all-natural and pure... and contains only ingredients backed by current science.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>To ensure the highest safety and quality standards, <strong>Genesis</strong>
            is manufactured right here in the United States (NOT China or India,
            like many of the fly-by-night knock-offs trying to steal our formula). </p>
        <p>That means you can rest assured what youâre taking is fully
            compliant with GMP safety standards... with no soy and no artificial
            colors whatsoever. </p>

            How big is each capsule?
        
        
      </h3>
        <p><strong>Genesis</strong> couldnât be easier.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The capsules are about the size of the average daily multi-vitamin
            and you get the full benefits with just one capsule per day.</p>
        <p>Thatâs all it takes to get a CLINICAL DOSE of each of the potent, youth-enhancing nutrients.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Be wary of anyone trying to sell you âkitchen sinkâ formulas that
            contain too little of each ingredient to have any effect (or that
            require you to take multiple doses each day, which is a clever way to
            disguise how much youâll really be paying to see results).</p>
