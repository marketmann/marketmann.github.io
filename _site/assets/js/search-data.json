The Power of Just 16 Little Words... . (and how those words can change your future, forever) . Can a short sentence change the history of the world? . And more importantly, can those same words change your fate... your destiny... your future? . To answer, we simply have to go back to a steamy day in Houston, TX more than 50 years ago... . SETTING: RICE STADIUM, Houston, Texas, 81 degrees . DATE: September 12, 1962 . CHARACTERS: John F. Kennedy, Jr... and 40,000 packed fans (many of whom, children.) . In front of a filled stadium Kennedy muttered these now famous 10 words... . &quot;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade...&rdquo; . 10. Short. Words. . And America was changed, forever... . As you may remember from history class, America was losing the race to space badly at the time. The Soviets were dominating. . Kennedy knew he needed to persuade the nation with his desire to &quot;put a man on the moon.&rdquo; . So he (and his speechwriters, no doubt) went to work on his act of persuasion... eventually coming up with the 10 words you&rsquo;ve just read. . Now, although the sentence was short, the rhetoric packed in those 10 words whallowed the trajectory of the nation. . John Jordan, author of &quot;Kennedy&#39;s Romantic Moon and Its Rhetorical Legacy for Space Exploration&quot; explains the three techniques Kennedy used to move America to act... . &quot;[Kennedy&rsquo;s speech used] a characterization of space as a beckoning frontier; an articulation of time that locates the endeavor within a historical moment of urgency and plausibility; and a final, cumulative strategy that invites audience members to live up to their pioneering heritage by going to the Moon.&quot; . Just over seven years later, Apollo 11 touched down on the gray, sandy surface of the moon. Neil and Buzz took their famous walk outside and planted the American flag. . And now, think about how much space technology touches your life everyday... . From Google Earth imagery of your house... to the GPS you enjoy in your car... to listening to SIRIUS satellite radio... . Would it all have been possible without Kennedy&rsquo;s 10 words? . Now, back to you... and the reason you&rsquo;re reading this book... which surely ISN&rsquo;T for a history lesson... . To transition to your story, I need to take you to a wholly different, much colder setting... . SETTING: Agora Financial offices in Baltimore, MD . DATE: February 1st, 2019 . CHARACTERS: Me (Joe Schriefer) and the author of this book (Evaldo) . And this story starts with a question. Or, rather, a list of questions... . &quot;How do you do it?&rdquo;&nbsp;I asked Evaldo. . &quot;Do what?,&rdquo; he quipped back. . &quot;How does a Brazilian man... whose native language is Portuguese... crush every single American copywriter that I&rsquo;ve ever seen?&rdquo; . To put the question in context, at Agora Financial we eat, live and sleep copywriting. In my part in helping to run the business I&rsquo;ve personally worked with more than 100+ copywriters... . ... Many of which are the &quot;A-list&rdquo; copywriters you&rsquo;ve come to know... . And none of them... NONE of them... could hold a proverbial candle to the year that Evaldo has just had. . Just a decade before I met Evaldo he only knew a basic few English words -- like &quot;book,&rdquo; &quot;cat&rdquo;, and &quot;table.&rdquo; . Yet in 2018 alone he (somehow) managed to bring in more than 100,000 front end customers AND write more than $80,000,000 worth of backend sales copy. . And to put those numbers in perspective... . They were more than 6 times more revenue I&rsquo;d ever seen ANYONE produce. . Said a different way, 600% more than any &quot;A- list&rdquo; writer I&rsquo;d ever worked with. . And Evaldo wasn&rsquo;t even a native English speaker! . I had to know his &quot;secret...&rdquo; . &quot;C&rsquo;mon, Evaldo, you&rsquo;re doing something differently than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo; I started to ask again. &quot;Spill it... what&rsquo;s the secret.&rdquo; . &quot;It all comes down to 16 simple words...&rdquo; he said in his (still thick) accent. . As we spent the rest of the day together, he walked me through his secret &quot;16-word sales letter&trade;.&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s a strategy I&rsquo;d never seen before in any of the copywriting guru courses... . A totally brand new breakthrough that allows you to tap into your customer&rsquo;s core belief, persuade that customer, and influence action. . Just like JFK muttered 10 words that put a man on the moon, you, too, can use Evaldo&rsquo;s 16 words to alter your copywriting future... your financial future... forever. . Read this book. Memorize these 16 words. Use. Evaldo&rsquo;s system in your next sales letter. . Then, just weeks later... . Watch in amazement as these 16 words add dollars to your bank account. . Best of all, it&rsquo;s so simple to execute that ANYONE can do it... . ... Even a Brazilian man... who doesn&rsquo;t speak native English... Who invented a system that turned himself into America&rsquo;s #1 copywriter. . Sincerely, . Joe Schriefer . Publisher, Agora Financial . Introduction . &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (Britney Spears), &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; (Katy Perry), &quot;One More Night&quot; (Maroon 5), &quot;Shake It Off&quot; (Taylor Swift), &quot;Can&#39;t Feel My Face&quot; (The Weeknd), &quot;Can&#39;t Stop the Feeling!&quot; (Justin Timberlake). . What do all these songs have in common? Two things. First, they all hit #1 on the . Billboard Hot 100 list. Second, believe it or not, they were all written by the same man: Max Martin. This guy has his hands in countless blockbuster pop songs of the last two decades. With 22 number one singles in the U.S., he&rsquo;s catching up with John Lennon (26) and Paul McCartney (32) as the most successful songwriter in Billboard chart history. . What&rsquo;s even more interesting is that, unlike John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Max Martin writes songs for a diverse range of artists, from the Backstreet Boys to Rhianna to Bon Jovi. And English isn&rsquo;t his first language: he&rsquo;s Swedish. . Some of his lyrics don&rsquo;t even quite make sense. And yet, it seems everything he touches turns into a major hit. His songs just strike an emotional chord with people and make them want to sing along. . What do all his songs have in common? First, they have short unique intro, a kind of a pattern interrupt. When you listen to his songs, you&rsquo;ll recognize it right off the bat. . Max explains that he &quot;came from the DJ world.... [T]o keep people on the floor, they had to know what was the song right away.&rdquo; A great example of this is the opening to Britney Spears&#39;s &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; with its immediately recognizable &quot;DUN DUN DUN.&rdquo; . Second, all of Max&rsquo;s songs hit the chorus within a minute, and often much faster. Why? Because today&rsquo;s audience has a much shorter attention span than audiences of the past. Max&rsquo;s songs get to the point fast, before people have a chance to switch the station. . Third, his lyrics are written in very, very basic English. Most are well below a fourth-grade reading level. His songs also have simple harmonic structure, mainly 3 to 4 chords. . And finally, they develop slowly, introducing one new sound or instrument at a time. He doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm the listener with too much at the same time. And he uses those different elements to create tension and balance. . If you&rsquo;re a copywriter like myself or work in direct marketing, you can see some parallels between what Max does with music and some basic principles of copywriting. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot more to his formula for success. . After all, I&rsquo;m no musician. I can&rsquo;t play a single instrument. But my point is, this guy has definitely figured something out. As a copywriter, I&rsquo;m intrigued. Because at the end of the day, much like movies and songs, sales letters also try to touch people on an emotional level. . If Max Martin has figured out a formula for success, could there also be a secret formula for sales letters that would virtually guarantee success? That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;ve been trying to answer for the past few years. After years of studying copy that converts, reading books on persuasion techniques, and most important, writing many, many, many sales letters that were total failures... I think I finally found it. . Before finding this formula, I was selling an average of about $2-3 million a year. Nothing spectacular. I was an average copywriter who had a &quot;hit ratio&rdquo; of about 20%-40%. Meaning, for every five sales letter I wrote, only one or two would work. . That meant I spent most of my time writing bombs that made me no royalties. But I did gain something that&rsquo;s worth way more than a fat royalty check. Those bombs helped me find the right direction. They showed me what works. And what doesn&rsquo;t. . After so much trial and error, I developed a simple formula... one so simple that it can be explained in just 16 words. In theory, it made a lot of sense to me. But I had no idea if it would work. . When I first used it in early 2017 in a video sales letter I was working on, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. . What happened next blew me away.... . Chapter 1 . The 16-Word Sales Letter&trade; that Sold $120+ Million in Two Years . That VSL went live on July 2017. Within an hour, sales started to pour in. And they haven&rsquo;t stopped yet, as I write this in 2019. . So far, that single piece of copy that followed the formula has generated more than $30 million in sales. After that blockbuster, I was hooked. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be? . All I have to do is follow this 16-word method and I can sell millions? Count me in! I started using this formula in every single project I wrote. As a result, my copy has generated over $120 million in just two years, from several different offers, different products, and different ideas. The one constant was this formula. . My &quot;hit ratio&rdquo; went from 20-30% to 60%-80%. . Now, before you assume I&rsquo;m some sort of copy genius, you should know that when I was 21 years old, I knew only a few words in English, words like &quot;book,&rdquo; &quot;cat,&rdquo; &quot;dog,&rdquo; and &quot;table.&rdquo; No joke. A decade ago I didn&rsquo;t even know what copywriting was. When I started writing copy in 2013, I had zero training in direct marketing&mdash;or any kind of marketing, for that matter. . So if this works for me, I know it can work for anyone. . Yes, even if you&rsquo;re a complete newbie. How do I know? Because as soon as I started mentoring other copywriters and applying my method to their copy, many of them went from zero to multi-million-dollar sales, seemingly out of the blue. One guy (I&rsquo;ll call him Mike) wrote me to say: . &quot;Before I worked with Evaldo, I knew squat about copywriting. Nothing. I had made zero dollars writing persuasive copy. . &quot;Within five months, my very first sales letter generated over $5 million in sales. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I knew my life would never be the same. . &quot;The copywriting strategies and concepts Evaldo taught me have forever altered the direction of my life and career, and ensured my future prosperity as a professional copywriter.&rdquo; . Another guy, I&rsquo;ll call him Justin, says: &quot;Before I started working with Evaldo, I was just a 23-year old college dropout with no prospects and less than $200 to my name. . &quot;Two years later, and I&rsquo;m making 6-figures a year, working when and where I want. . &quot;While all the copywriting &lsquo;gurus&rsquo; are at seminars talking about hypothetical, theoretical bullshit... Evaldo is sitting in the corner with his laptop, writing tens of millions of dollars in winning copy every single year.&rdquo; . Brian (also an alias) also sent me a &quot;thank you&rdquo; note, saying: . &quot;It&rsquo;s crazy to think... this year I&rsquo;ll take home 10 times more money than I made last year. I paid off $30k in student loans in one lump sum payment.... Now I&rsquo;m looking for a new house to buy! . &quot;Working with Evaldo is the closest thing to guaranteeing a multi-million dollar promotion EVERY TIME you put a campaign together. . &quot;This might sound ridiculous... But if I had the choice of ANY mentor in the history of copywriting (Gary Halbert, Gene Schwartz, Gary Bencivenga)... I would choose Evaldo Albuquerque. The results speak for themselves... I&rsquo;ve got $20mm+ in sales with a little more than a year of copywriting experience.&rdquo; . Yeah, I know... Brian has lost his mind for comparing me to those copy legends. But holy shit... Isn&rsquo;t that amazing? . So What&rsquo;s the Secret 16-Word Sales Letter&trade;? . Here it is: . &quot;The secret to converting copy is to define the one belief, then answer these ten questions.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll make it even easier for you to remember. Just four words: One belief. Ten questions. . The one belief will not only help you judge the strength of your idea. It will also set the tone of your entire copy, the common thread that keeps everything together. . The ten questions will add a ton of emotional triggers to your copy. And since they&rsquo;re sequential, they will also help you organize your promo from lead all the way to the closing. . The beauty here is that these questions never change. Once you internalize them, writing a sales letter will become automatic for you. Follow this process, and staring at a blank page for hours not knowing what to write next will become a thing of the past. . You&rsquo;ll also never get lost in the middle of the project. I know that for newbie copywriters, that&rsquo;s probably one of the biggest challenges they face. I know because I&rsquo;ve been there. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the woods when you don&rsquo;t have a map pointing you in the right direction. . Imagine how much easier writing copy will become once you know exactly what to write, even before you type your first word. Your productivity will skyrocket. You know that means for you? . If you own a business, once you share this with your copywriters, you&rsquo;ll have no shortage of sales letters. This could help explode your business. If you&rsquo;re a copywriter like myself, it means more royalties! And more time to do whatever the heck you want! . I&rsquo;m telling you this because that&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me. I used to write one full package every two months, which is average. After implementing this method, I was writing one new sales letter a month. . That&rsquo;s right. My productivity doubled. Using this method, I&rsquo;ve written full packages in as little as two weeks... including a crypto offer that went on to bring in 100,000+ new paid names (before it &quot;broke the Internet&rdquo; and got banned on Google and other networks). . People around the office in Agora started asking me &quot;how the hell do you crank out so much copy?&rdquo; Some people thought I must be working 20 hours a day. But the truth is, I wasn&rsquo;t working harder. I was just working smarter. . So how does it work? . It all begins with the one belief. . Chapter 2 . Your Mission: Make the Reader Believe in the One Belief . Before the 1980s, military plans used to be extremely robust, including every single detail imaginable. What each unit will do. What equipment they&rsquo;ll use. How they&rsquo;ll replace ammunition. And so on. . There was just one problem. The plans often became useless a few minutes into battle. As Mike Tyson has said, &quot;Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth.&rdquo; . As you can imagine, a lot of unpredictable things happen in the battlefield. And when they do, everything you planned becomes useless. . After so many failed missions, the U.S. Army adapted its strategy and invented a concept called Commander&rsquo;s Intent (CI). It appears on top of every order specifying the desired end state of the operation (the goal). . Instead of being a play-by-play instruction manual, the CI provides only the desired destination. It gives everyone on the team the flexibility they need to react to unpredictable events. As Jocko Willink and . Leif Babin write in their excellent book Extreme Ownership, about Navy SEAL leadership: . &quot;While a simple statement, the Commander&rsquo;s Intent is actually the most important part of the brief. When understood by everyone involved in the execution of the plan, it guides each decision and action on the ground.&rdquo; . When you write a sales letter, you also must have a Commander&rsquo;s Intent. And that&rsquo;s exactly what &quot;the one belief&rdquo; is. It describes the ultimate goal of the sales letter. . When most people write copy, they don&rsquo;t have a mission. But how are you supposed to write copy that converts if you don&rsquo;t know the ultimate goal of the letter? How are you supposed to succeed if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish? . It&rsquo;s impossible. And it&rsquo;s a big reason why a lot of copywriters fail. It&rsquo;s a big reason why I&rsquo;ve failed many times. . With the one belief, you will know what your mission is. It&rsquo;s your North Star, guiding you all the way to a high-converting sales letter. . Officers arrive at the Commander&rsquo;s Intent by asking themselves the question &quot;What is the single most important thing we must do during the mission?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how we arrive at the one belief. . The single most important thing you can do when you write a sales letter is to make the reader believe that: . This new opportunity is the key to their desire and it&rsquo;s only attainable through my new mechanism. . That&rsquo;s your mission. Write it down. . I learned this concept from Russel Brunson, who said: &quot;If I can get someone to TRULY believe that the new opportunity is the key to what they want the most, and they can only get it through my vehicle, then they have no other options but to buy.&rdquo; . While Russel was talking about launching your business online, this concept can easily be applied to every single sales letter you write. It&rsquo;s a critical part of my formula. . The one belief will force you to find the core of your idea. It will force you to get rid of superfluous stuff and less important insights. As a result, you&rsquo;ll focus on the one idea that will drive your sales letter. . As you can see, you can break the one belief down into three main elements: the new opportunity, your prospect&rsquo;s desire, and the new mechanism. Let&rsquo;s dig deeper into each one. . The New Opportunity . Remember when I said the one belief will help you judge the strength of your idea? If you can&rsquo;t identify the new opportunity, then your idea isn&rsquo;t unique. And that means it&rsquo;s not even worth testing. . For example, &quot;eating healthy and exercising&rdquo; cannot be your new opportunity. Neither can &quot;investing in the stock market.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing unique about those ideas. . But here&rsquo;s the thing. If your idea is truly unique, then your prospect will have no idea they need it, right? That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not enough just to have something that&rsquo;s new. . In the sales letter, we also need to show why they need it. That&rsquo;s where their desires come in. They must believe that the new opportunity you&rsquo;re presenting is the key to their desire. . If they don&rsquo;t believe that, your new opportunity won&rsquo;t touch them on an emotional level. And it will be extremely hard for you to persuade your prospect. . Your Prospect&rsquo;s Desire . The main thing here is to remember that your new opportunity can be the key to their desire only if it provides benefits. It can be the key to their desire only if it will help your prospect feel more significant, respected, and valued. If it can help increase your prospect&rsquo;s mental, physical, social, emotional, sexual, or financial well-being. Or if it can decrease or eliminate the risk of events that will negatively impact your prospect&rsquo;s mental, physical, social, emotional, sexual, or financial well-being. . For the health niche, the desire could be to lose weight, lower your blood pressure, build muscle, etc. . For the biz op space, it could be to work from home, quit your job, etc. And for the financial space, where I operate, it could be safety in retirement or taking care of family. . The New Mechanism . Once your readers believe your new opportunity is the key to their desire, now they must believe you&rsquo;re the only one who can meet that need. You have to make them believe that ONLY your new mechanism can help them. . Having a new mechanism is key in today&rsquo;s competitive market environment. No matter what niche you operate in, chances are your prospects have seen everything. Remember the wise words of Eugene Schwartz: . &quot;If your market is at the stage where they&rsquo;ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won&rsquo;t work any longer. . What this market needs now is a new device... a new mechanism, a new way to make the old promise work. A fresh chance, a brand-new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before.&rdquo; . While the new opportunity reveals WHAT is unique about your solution, the new mechanism reveals HOW it works. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s the vehicle that deliver the new opportunity. It&rsquo;s the secret sauce that explains why your solution works. . In the financial niche, it could be the proprietary algorithm behind the strategy/trading system you&rsquo;re selling. . In the biz op space, it could be a mentorship program about a new type of online business. . In the health niche, it could be a unique combination of natural herbs in just one pill, which is very common in supplement offers. . Once you know your new opportunity, your customer&rsquo;s desire, and your new mechanism, you&rsquo;re ready to write down your one belief. . Here are a Few Examples of &quot;The One Belief&rdquo; . The one belief for P-90X: . Avoiding the plateau effect (new opportunity) is the key to building muscle (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the P90-X &quot;muscle confusion&rdquo; system (new mechanism). . The one belief for Jeff Walker&rsquo;s Product Launch Formula: . Warming up your prospects (new opportunity) is the key to successfully launching a new product online (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the Jeff Walker&rsquo;s Product Launch Formula (new mechanism). . The one belief for Proactive: . Attacking acne at every stage of the cycle (new opportunity) is the key to keeping your skin clear and healthy-looking (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Proactiv&rsquo;s Combination Therapy&reg; (new mechanism). . The one belief for Invisalign: . Aligning your teeth without ugly braces (new opportunity) is the key to getting the smile you want without disrupting your life (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the Invisalign proprietary technology (new mechanism). . The one belief for Subway (before Jared got arrested for child pornography): . Eating healthy fast food (new opportunity) is the key to losing weight (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through a diet based on Subway sandwiches (new mechanism). . The one belief for water pitcher Turapur: . Drinking ionized water (new opportunity) is the key to feeling young and energetic (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Turapur Pitcher&rsquo;s unique filtering system (new mechanism). . The one belief for Febreze: . Adding a pleasant smell at the end of your cleaning routine (new opportunity) is the key to keeping your home looking fresh and clean (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Febreze&rsquo;s OdorClear technology (new mechanism.) . The one belief for three different financial offers I wrote: . Getting in the trade before the news is published (new opportunity) is the key to making easy money every week (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the patent-pending Weekly Paycheck Indicator (new mechanism). . Trading penny stocks on Friday (new opportunity) is the key to making easy money every weekend (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through Tim Sykes&rsquo;s proprietary news screen system (new mechanism). . Investing in private companies before they go public (new opportunity) is the key to making the biggest gains in the stock market (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the secret IPO account I uncovered (new mechanism). . And here&rsquo;s the one belief for my copy method: . Following a copy system that provides clarity, purpose, and structure (new opportunity) is the key to writing converting copy in no time (desire) and it&rsquo;s attainable only through the 16-word sales letter&trade; (new mechanism). . I could go on and on. But the truth of the matter is you could write the one belief for every single successful marketing campaign throughout history. . So what&rsquo;s the one belief for the project you&rsquo;re working on? . Once you write that down, you can move on to the ten sequential questions. They&rsquo;ll structure the promo for you, making your job way easier. . Chapter 3 . Injecting Dopamine into Your Prospect&rsquo;s Brain with Question #1 . He was a very quiet kid. He hardly spoke at all until he was three years old. In fact, his parents worried there was something wrong with him. . When he was five years old, his parents gave him a magnetic compass. And that changed everything. . He was fascinated by the fact that no matter which way he turned the compass, the needle always pointed the same direction. That new toy made him wonder about magnetic fields, which got him interested in physics. . That&rsquo;s how his lifetime journey of exploration started. Many years later, he wrote about the compass, saying: &quot;That experience made a deep and lasting impression on me. Something deeper had to be hidden behind things.&rdquo; . The name of the kid? Albert Einstein. Most of us are not geniuses like he was. But we all have that same capacity to be curious about something new. We love novelty. . And that&rsquo;s why the first question you must answer is this: . Question #1: How is this different from everything else I&rsquo;ve seen? . You must begin by explaining what the new opportunity is. As I mentioned in the last chapter, if your idea is not unique, it&rsquo;s useless. . Why? Because it will not active dopamine pathways in your prospect&rsquo;s brains. Without the release of dopamine, your customer will just ignore your message. . Cognitive neuroscientists Nico Bunzeck and Emrah D&uuml;zel used MRI images to study how the brain reacts to novelty. They found that there&rsquo;s a region of our midbrain called the substantia nigra or ventral segmental area that &quot;lights up&rdquo; when we see new stuff. . This &quot;novelty center&rdquo; of our brain is activated only when we come across something completely new. If it&rsquo;s something familiar, it stays dormant. . Here&rsquo;s how Bunzeck and D&uuml;zel explain it: . &quot;When we see something new, we see it has a potential for rewarding us in some way. This potential that lies in new things motivates us to explore our environment for rewards. The brain learns that the stimulus, once familiar, has no reward associated with it and so it loses its potential. . &quot;For this reason, only completely new objects activate the midbrain area and increase our levels of dopamine.&rdquo; . Our Brains are Wired for Novelty . If you think about it, that makes perfect sense from an evolutionary point of view. It was exploring new things that led humans to spread around the world. It&rsquo;s how we were able to adapt to all sorts of different environments. . That happened because we evolved from acting on raw instinct alone to identifying new things and learning about them. The fact that our brains release dopamine when we come across novelty probably gave us a great evolutionary advantage. . My buddy Oren Klaff talks about this in his great book Pitch Anything. He says: &quot;Attention will be given when information novelty is high and will drift away when information novelty is low.&rdquo; . He goes on to explain how humans survived in the African Savanna by detecting change: . &quot;The only way to survive from one day to the next is detecting change, because trees were not threatening, grass was not threatening, clouds were not threatening unless they moved. . &quot;Things that moved were threatening to our survival and we dedicated most of the 60% to 80% of our brain matter to detecting change. So if you don&rsquo;t characterize things in terms of change, the physical nature of our brain isn&rsquo;t attracted to it.&rdquo; . Here&#39;s the bottom line. Only novelty will release the right dose of dopamine that will get your customer into &quot;exploring&rdquo; mode&mdash;that will get them excited enough to keep reading a sales letter to find out more about that &quot;new&rdquo; thing. . That&rsquo;s how our brains are wired. Nobody can change that. If you ignore that fact, you&rsquo;ll never succeed in copy. . That&rsquo;s why your USP should always be in your headline and at the beginning of your sales letter. The new opportunity needs to feel like a breakthrough. It needs to feel like you just figured something out, and you&rsquo;re revealing what you discovered to the reader. . It could be a new cure, a new way of losing weight, a new way of making money, a new business model, etc. . In the financial niche, I&rsquo;ve written about a new law, a new loophole, a new threat, a new prediction, a new discovery, a new conspiracy, a new political scandal, a new trading system, etc. . Here&rsquo;s how I started the first sales letter I wrote using this method (the one that has sold more than $30 mil): . &quot;Hi, I&rsquo;m Alan Knuckman. . I&rsquo;ll introduce myself fully in just a moment. . But right now I want you to look at this piece of paper I&rsquo;m holding in my hand. . It&rsquo;s patent application # D0365193. . It was filed with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the invention of a powerful NEW market indicator... . The ONLY indicator in the world that can tip you off about impending big market news... . BEFORE the news becomes public.&rdquo; . Notice how I begin the letter by explaining why this is different from everything else they&rsquo;ve seen in the past. It has to be truly unique. Once you answer that question, your prospect&rsquo;s brain will be filled with dopamine. . Now you can move on to the next question.... . Chapter 4 . The Man Who Helped Ending World War I with Toilet Paper . At the end of 1914, the British came up with a new plan to defeat Germany: starve the German people into submission through a blockade strategy. . By 1917, only Sweden and a handful of other minor sources on the European continent were selling goods to Germany. . As a result, German soldiers at the front lines weren&rsquo;t getting the food, clothing, and equipment they needed. Hundreds of thousands of German soldiers didn&rsquo;t have boots, socks, or jackets. . That&rsquo;s when the Allies employed Harry Reichenbach, at that time the greatest American advertiser in history. His mission was to figure out a way to persuade German soldiers to surrender. . How do you persuade someone to become a prisoner of war? . After interviewing hundreds of German soldiers in prison camps, Reichenbach made a list of what their biggest desires were. He then wrote a short sales letter based on those big &quot;pain points.&rdquo; . Their direct mail strategy was to drop 45 million of those letters over Germany&rsquo;s lines. The result? German soldiers started surrendering in masses. So much so that it became a capital offense to pick up any pieces of paper on the ground. . Here&rsquo;s what that sales letter offered: . If they surrendered, all German prisoners would be given officer rank. As &quot;prisoners with officer rank,&rdquo; every day they would get bread and meat to eat, cigarettes to smoke, a comb, and 24 sheets of toilet paper (German soldiers had none in the trenches). . This letter worked because it immediately answered the question &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s our next question in the process. . Question #2: What&rsquo;s in it for me? . My two boys never seem to listen to me when I try telling them what to do. If you have kids, I&rsquo;m sure you can relate to that. But there&rsquo;s one little trick that never seem to fail. . If I frame my request with &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for them,&rdquo; they will listen to me. Something as simple as &quot;go finish your homework because as soon as you&rsquo;re done, we can go to the park and play soccer&rdquo; always works. . In the classic book How to Win Friends and Influence People, pretty much all of Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s secrets are about focusing on the other person. Want to make people like you? Become genuinely interested in them and talk in terms of their interests. . Use their name because to that person it&rsquo;s the sweetest and most important sound in any language. . Encourage them to talk about themselves. Make them feel important. . Do any of these influence secrets mention yourself? No. It&rsquo;s all about the other person. And your sales letter should be, too, especially at the beginning. That&rsquo;s why the most important word in any sales letter is &quot;You.&rdquo; . Dale Carnegie talks explicitly about how we&rsquo;re all interested in what we want. For that reason, the only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want. . It seems like such an obvious statement. But I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many sales letters I&rsquo;ve read that don&rsquo;t answer that question within seconds. They go on and on talking about other stuff, and by the time they answer &quot;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;, the reader has given up reading the letter a long time ago. . Never forget: people don&rsquo;t have to read your shit. . It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re sitting at home just waiting for you to send them your offer. It&rsquo;s the opposite. . You&rsquo;re most likely disrupting their day. A lot of people are probably reading your stuff on their phone. And that trend will only accelerate in the coming years. . For that reason, they&rsquo;re looking for a reason NOT to read your letter or watch your VSL. If you don&rsquo;t answer this question within seconds, you&rsquo;re giving them that reason. They&rsquo;ll leave your page and go back to whatever they were doing before. . So put yourself in your customer&rsquo;s shoes and ask yourself &quot;what promise can I make here at the beginning of my letter that will get my customer salivating?&rdquo; . The big promise must be tied to your customer&rsquo;s key desires. . In the health space, it could be &quot;lose up to 20 pounds a month eating nothing but donuts and pizza.&rdquo; . In the biz op space it could be &quot;make $10,000 a month online without having to build a website, hire a copywriter, or even develop a product.&rdquo; . And here&rsquo;s a section of one of my sales letters with the big promise: . &quot;I call it the &quot;weekly paycheck indicator&rdquo; because it gives you the chance to collect a BIG Paycheck of $10,200 or more... Every. Single. Week.&rdquo; . Make that big promise in the first page of your letter. Because that will probably be the only chance you&rsquo;ll have to make an emotional impact. . We&rsquo;ve all heard about the study showing that people today have attention spans shorter than a goldfish&rsquo;s and that we lose focus after eight seconds. I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that number is. But the undeniable truth is that our attention span or patience for irrelevant details is lower than ever. . That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re bombarded every day with so much information that we must ignore most of it and focus only on what matters to us. And we tend to do that very, very quickly. . And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to answer the question very quickly. In my sales letters, I like to answer both questions #1 and #2 in the first page. . Once you tell your customer how your idea is unique and the big promise it can deliver, you&rsquo;ve piqued their interest. . Now you just have to prove you&rsquo;re not full of shit. . And that bring us to the next question.... . Chapter 5 . In a World Full of Bullshit, Proof is King . . Check out this ad for a 1995 Pontiac found on Craigslist. &quot;Never in your life has a car made you so appealing to the opposite sex.&rdquo; WOW. The landscape is so competitive these days that the only way you can grab someone&rsquo;s attention is by having a ridiculous promise like this one. . For example, in the competitive financial niche, the promises have become more and more ridiculous in the last few years. Doubling your money in one year used to be a good promise. . Now you have to promise doubling your money every day to stand out. Everything needs to be bigger, faster, easier... or you&rsquo;ll have no chance of competing with all the other aggressive promises out there. . Eugene Schwartz talks about this trend of one-upmanship in Breakthrough Advertising: . &quot;If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new mechanism announcement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem: overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits.&rdquo; . The problem with this race is that eventually we all hit a point where our promises are unbelievable. And that&rsquo;s why, if you&rsquo;re operating in a competitive market&mdash;and these days everyone is&mdash;you must follow the first two questions with some proof that supports your one belief. That&rsquo;s why the third question in our method is... . Question #3: How do I know this is real? . If you&rsquo;ve done your job right on the previous two questions, your prospect will be pretty skeptical at this point. If you don&rsquo;t show some proof that you can deliver on your promise, they might leave your page. They&rsquo;ll want to believe you because you&rsquo;ve made such a good promise. But they&rsquo;ll be skeptical anyway. . So you&rsquo;ll want to show some initial proof, such as historical charts, testimonials, third party quotes, etc. I&rsquo;m not going to get into the different types of proofs. There are plenty of other copywriting courses and books that talk about them. . Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important: whatever proof you end up using, you should wrap it up in an ABT structure. . What&rsquo;s an ABT structure? It&rsquo;s a simple story- telling format. . A lot of copywriters show proof and more proof and more proof, but they never create a story around those proof elements. Therefore, their sales letters become boring to read and fail to convert prospects into customers. . And there you have it. I just used the ABT structure, which stands for: . &quot;And&rdquo; | &quot;But&rdquo; | &quot;Therefore.&rdquo; | . In the book Houston, We Have a Narrative: Why Science Needs Story, author Randy Olson talks about how this ABT idea came from Trey Parker, co- creator of South Park. . In a documentary about the show, Parker has explained how he edits the scripts: &quot;I sort of always call it the rule of replacing &quot;and&rdquo; with either &quot;but&rdquo; or &quot;therefore&rdquo;... this happens, THEREFORE this happens, BUT this happens.&rdquo; . Isn&rsquo;t that brilliant? So simple, and so brilliant. . If you think about it, these three little words are the basic building blocks of any narrative. . &quot;And&rdquo; helps set up the background and give momentum to the story. &quot;But&rdquo; creates conflict, adding the tension any good story needs. And &quot;therefore&rdquo; gives the story a conclusion. . No wonder Hollywood screenwriters often follow that format when writing their logline maker, a short description of the concept. . Here&rsquo;s an example of a logline: A young man meets a crazy scientist and travels to the past in a time machine and meets his future parents. But he accidently distracts his mother from noticing and falling in love with his father. Therefore, he is forced to bring them together or he will cease to exist. . Notice that whatever follows after &quot;but&rdquo; is what really makes the story good. It&rsquo;s all about the tension. . This ABT format is effective because we are hardwired for storytelling. Just like our brains are wired to pay attention to new things, they&rsquo;re also wired to receive information in the ABT format. . A Copy Lesson from Rokia . In 2004, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University conducted a study to see what sorts of messaging compelled people to donate to a charity called Save the Children. . Half the study participants were given the story of Rokia, a little girl in Mali growing up in extreme poverty. She often goes days without food, and her family can&rsquo;t afford basic needs such as healthcare and education. . The other half of the participants were given a letter with all the facts and statistics on poverty in . Africa. Those who saw Rokia&rsquo;s story donated an average of $2.38. Those who saw the facts donated an average of $1.14. . But here&rsquo;s the interesting part. They ran the study again, but this time they gave one group both, the story and the facts. They expected that having all the information would boost donations. . But they were wrong. The people in that group donated an average of $1.43, still lower than the story alone. Why did that happen? . As Chip and Dan Heath explain in Made to Stick, Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die: &quot;The researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. . When people think analytically, they&#39;re less like to think emotionally.&rdquo; . Isn&rsquo;t that fascinating? Give people only facts, and they&rsquo;ll think analytically. . If you&rsquo;re writing a sales letter, that&rsquo;s the last thing you want. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important when you answer question #3 to use storytelling. . This ABT story format will get your reader to act emotionally, which is exactly what you want. . For example, in the financial niche you can turn even a boring chart with an indicator into an ABT format story with something like this: . &quot;The company had &lsquo;sell&rsquo; ratings... and&nbsp;earnings were declining.... Most people thought the company was going bankrupt.... No wonder shares were tanking, as you can see in the chart. . But then out of the blue my indicator flashed a buy signal, indicating shares were about to explode higher. At first nothing happened. I thought the indicator had failed. . But as soon as the market opened the next day, boom, shares exploded higher. So (therefore) had you placed a simple trade, you could have made a quick $9,500 that day.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s another example from another sales letter I wrote. Notice two important things. First, I&rsquo;m revealing some proof this is a real opportunity right on the first page, without revealing what the secret is. . Second, notice how I wrapped all the third- party quotes in an ABT format, which helped add some tension to the lead. . &quot;There&rsquo;s a lot of money at stake.... . As Forbes says, those who know how to take advantage of this provision &lsquo;may be on course for a multimillion-dollar tax break.&rsquo; . Ed Kleinbard, a former chief of staff of Congress&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Taxation, called this provision a &lsquo;complete giveaway.&rsquo; . And Bloomberg called it &lsquo;a multimillion- dollar windfall.&rsquo; . I call this opportunity &lsquo;Congressional Checks&rsquo;... . Because while 99.9% of everyday Americans are in the dark... . A handful of congressmen have already been collecting this easy cash. . The media is NOT reporting on this shocking scandal... . But I&rsquo;ll show you the truth in the next two minutes... . I&rsquo;ll even show you the documents they filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives... . Documents that PROVE they&rsquo;re collecting Congressional Checks of $115,000... $350,000... and even $2 million. . In fact, the International Business Times&nbsp;reviewed the most recent personal financial disclosure records of 44 lawmakers in the House and Senate. . And they&rsquo;ve confirmed congressmen have collected up to &lsquo;$16 million of annual income from those [Congressional Checks].&rsquo; . Does that seem fair to you? . While these politicians are collecting millions of dollars... . Most hardworking taxpayers like you don&rsquo;t even know about this little-known tax provision... . And they&rsquo;re missing out on what CNBC called &lsquo;a tax windfall&rsquo;... . Simply because this provision was buried in more than 500 pages of new tax rules.&rdquo; . If you&rsquo;re writing sales letters in the health space, instead of just citing scientific results, try to tell the story of the scientific discovery. . Here&rsquo;s an example from a successful health promotion written by Paul Amos, one of the best in the business: . &quot;In the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Warburg&rsquo;s experiments on cellular respiration... the way our cells use oxygen for energy... revealed something ASTONISHING. . In order to survive, cancer cells function in a way completely unlike&nbsp;that of regular cells. . They actually use a different cellular &lsquo;fuel&rsquo; than healthy cells normally use... . And if you simply &lsquo;shut off&rsquo; this fuel supply, cancer cells die. . But&nbsp;because regular cells don&rsquo;t have to use this &lsquo;fuel&rsquo;... they aren&rsquo;t affected at all. . The cancer cells die... almost immediately... and regular cells continue to stay healthy.&rdquo; . Can you see how this is way more effective than just citing a boring scientific paper? A narrative is always much more engaging than simply listing data, facts, and findings. . Here&rsquo;s a different way of thinking about this. Imagine you&rsquo;re talking to your prospect through a two-way radio. Your prospect is always on the . storytelling channel. If you&rsquo;re just citing facts, he won&rsquo;t get your message. You must be on the same channel. . Remember, your mission is to make the reader believe in the one belief. So the entire purpose of presenting proof in an ABT format is to help make your customer believe. Once you have some proof, you can move to the next question... . And that&rsquo;s where the magic really happens! . Chapter 6 . It&rsquo;s Time to Reveal the REAL Problem with Question #4 . Imagine trying to sell a product in the healthy diet space with the following copy: . &quot;If you&rsquo;re struggling to lose weight, it&rsquo;s probably because your diet is based on bagels, donuts, and pizza... and you never go to the gym.&rdquo; . Or imagine trying to sell a financial newsletter with this: . &quot;If you haven&rsquo;t saved enough for retirement, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re bad with money and didn&rsquo;t start saving early enough.&rdquo; . Or this one in the biz op space: . &quot;If you haven&rsquo;t launched your own online business, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re afraid of failing and not really the entrepreneur type.&rdquo; . Think any of these pieces of copy would have any chance of success? Hell no. That&rsquo;s not what people want to hear. . In general, people don&rsquo;t want to take responsibility for their failures. If you want to sell more, you need to justify their failures. . As Blair Warren wrote in The One Sentence Persuasion Course (my favorite copywriting book of all time): . &quot;While millions cheer Dr. Phil as he tells people to accept responsibility for their mistakes, millions more are looking for someone to take the responsibility off their shoulders. To tell them that they are not responsible for their lot in life. . &quot;And while accepting responsibility is essential for gaining control of one&rsquo;s own life, assuring others they are not responsible is essential for gaining influence over theirs.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s why the next question you must answer is... . Question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? . The purpose of this question is to justify your prospect failure by revealing the REAL PROBLEM. . When your prospects hit the sales page, many of them have already tried numerous similar products. . In the financial niche, maybe they&rsquo;ve tried several different investment strategies. . In the health niche, maybe they&rsquo;ve tried multiple weight loss products or plans. . Most of those probably didn&rsquo;t work for them. Maybe they&rsquo;ve lost money with other financial newsletters. Or maybe they&rsquo;ve tried a supplement or a workout plan and didn&rsquo;t lose any weight. . Whatever the situation, it&rsquo;s important to realize they&rsquo;ve probably tried something similar in the past. . We need to justify their failure by showing them the REAL reason why those strategies or products they&rsquo;ve tried in the past have not worked. . And here&rsquo;s where the simplicity of this copy method comes in. In order to find the real problem, all you need to do is reverse-engineer your answer to question #1. . I know this may sound confusing. Let me walk you through a real example using one of my sales letters. . This particular promo was selling a financial indicator that could help you get in a trade before market-moving news was published. The answer to question #1 (How is this unique?) for that sales letter was this: . It&rsquo;s the only indicator in the world that helps you get in the trade BEFORE the news is published. . Now, here&rsquo;s question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? . Answer: The real problem is that you&rsquo;re getting in the trade AFTER the news is published. By the time you get in it&rsquo;s already too late and the big gains have already been made. . See how simple this can be? It&rsquo;s simple, but very powerful. You&rsquo;re telling your customers the reason why they failed in the past is that all the solutions they tried never addressed the REAL problem. But now there&rsquo;s finally a NEW OPPORTUNITY, a new solution that addresses the real problem. . It&rsquo;s All About Giving Your Prospect Hope . Your prospects will think this could finally be what they&rsquo;ve been looking for. This won&rsquo;t fail like everything else they&rsquo;ve tried in the past. . You&rsquo;re essentially giving them hope. And isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re all really selling? . That&rsquo;s why I said before that this is where the magic happens. Without hope, your prospect will not buy. And the good news is that you can use this in any niche. . In fact, this is very common in the health space, where you&rsquo;ll see things like &quot;if you&rsquo;re working out and eating healthy, but you&rsquo;re still struggling to lose weight... it&rsquo;s not your fault. It&rsquo;s because your testosterone levels are low/ your thyroid isn&rsquo;t working/ you have bad bacteria in your gut, [insert the real problem here]....&rdquo; . You&rsquo;re revealing the real problem, a problem that can be solved only by your new mechanism. Of course, all this needs to be based on solid logic and backed up by facts. . Here&rsquo;s how I did it in that financial offer I mentioned before: . &quot;If you&rsquo;ve lost money with other indicators or trading systems in the past... it&rsquo;s NOT your fault. . That&rsquo;s because all other systems on earth that I&rsquo;m aware of are based on price data. . They only trigger a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; signal when the price changes... AFTER the big moves. . By the time you get in, it&rsquo;s already too late. . The breakthrough indicator you&rsquo;re about to see is totally different.... . It&rsquo;s a brand new way of making money. . It&rsquo;s all about getting AHEAD of everyone else... . And collecting a BIG paycheck when the information finally becomes public. . That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s protected by U.S. Patent Application # D0365193.&rdquo; . See how I took the blame of their failures off their shoulders and put it onto the old opportunities they tried? . That&rsquo;s how you plant the seeds of hope in your prospects&rsquo; minds. You&rsquo;re starting to tell them, indirectly, that they&rsquo;ve failed because they didn&rsquo;t have what you&rsquo;re offering. . And FINALLY you&rsquo;re giving them the opportunity to replace what&rsquo;s not working with something better: your new mechanism. . At this point your prospects will begin to believe that your new mechanism is the only thing that can help them achieve what they desire (a key part of the one belief). . You&rsquo;ve justified your prospects&rsquo; failures and given them hope. Now we&rsquo;re going to inject even more emotion into your sales letter by leveraging your prospects&rsquo; tribal instincts. . Chapter 7 . It&rsquo;s Time to Play the &quot;Us vs.Them&rdquo; Card with Question #5 . &quot;The end of Earth is near. You need to leave the planet now by boarding a spaceship that&rsquo;s trailing the Hale-Bopp Comet. But in order to enter that spaceship, you must abandon your human body. . All you need to do is eat this apple sauce mixed with lethal doses of phenobarbital. But don&rsquo;t worry. An unidentified flying object (UFO) will take your soul to another level of existence above human.&rdquo; . What would you do if I told you that? Probably put me in a straitjacket, right? . But in 1997, 38 people believed every word of that and followed those directions, in a mass suicide by the Heaven&#39;s Gate cult. . As a copywriter, I find this very interesting. I&rsquo;m just trying to persuade people to give me their credit card number. And here you have a cult leader who convinced 38 people that committing suicide would enable them to enter a spaceship flying in the wake of a comet. . Don&rsquo;t you want to know his persuasive secrets? . Well, one of the secrets of this cult (and every cult) is that cult leaders make their members feel like they&rsquo;re part of a special group. They isolate members from friends and family by convincing them that those outside the cult just don&rsquo;t get it. . That&rsquo;s why Scientology (yes, it&rsquo;s a cult!) advocates something they call &quot;disconnection&rdquo; as key to their members&rsquo; spiritual growth. What is disconnection? It&rsquo;s basically cutting all ties to anyone who criticizes scientology, including family and friends. . But this type of group dynamic doesn&rsquo;t happen only in cults. Our brains are wired to be tribal. According to psychological studies, any group of humans will sort themselves into us/them groups within seconds, and for almost any reason. . One study has shown that a 50-millisecond exposure to the face of someone of another race is enough to activate the amygdala. Another study has shown that fans at a soccer match are more likely to aid an injured spectator if he&rsquo;s wearing the home team jersey. . My favorite is a study showing how this happens at the subconscious level, proving that &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; happens automatically. . This study involved morning commuters at a train station in a predominantly white neighborhood. They filled out questionnaires about their political views. Then at half the stations, a pair of Mexicans began to appear each morning chatting quietly in Spanish before boarding the train. . After two weeks, commuters filled out a second questionnaire. The presence of the Mexicans speaking . Spanish made people more supportive of decreasing LEGAL immigration from Mexico and making English the official language. Fascinating, right? . If you think about it from the point of view of evolution, it makes a lot of sense. Our caveman ancestors survived only by being part of a group. The group provided comfort and protection against rival groups and the challenging environment. . Nobody is immune to this need to be part of a group. . There are many ways to make people feel like they&rsquo;re part of a group. But having a common enemy is one of the most powerful ways. . That&rsquo;s why the &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; card is so powerful. We&rsquo;ve seen its power throughout history in some of the most memorable conflicts. . Conquistadors vs. Natives in the 16th century. . Christians vs. Muslims during the Crusades. . American Colonies vs. the British Empire during the American Revolution. . North vs. South during the American Civil War. Nazi Germans vs. Jews before and during WWII. . Capitalism vs. socialism during the Cold War. . Jihadists vs. &quot;Infidels&rdquo; in acts of terrorism that continue through today. . Back in 2001, I personally experienced this &quot;us vs. them&rdquo; mentality. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, America came together. The nation was united as one. Stores ran out of flags, millions donated blood, thousands enlisted. . At the time, I was an international student trying to learn English in Nebraska. The day after the attack, I was in one my classes when a discussion about immigration began. One of the students proclaimed: &quot;Why do we even allow these international students here? We should just kick them out.&rdquo; . At that time, I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend why anyone would say something dumb like that, especially a college student. But now I know he was just putting me in the &quot;them&rdquo; bucket. If I wasn&rsquo;t an American, I must have been one of &quot;them.&rdquo; . That comment wasn&rsquo;t coming from his frontal cortex. It was coming from his reptilian brain. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced us vs. them too. We all have. We see it in our day-to-day lives... your favorite team vs. the other teams, Democrats vs. Republicans, dog lovers vs. cat lovers, etc. . Science shows that having a common enemy releases oxytocin, increasing the sense of belonging. And guess what? If you make your prospects feel like part of a group, they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to buy your product. No wonder some of the most successful ads set someone or something up as a common enemy. . Just look at what most critics rank as one of the best ads of all time, the iconic 1984 ad for Apple&rsquo;s first Macintosh. In that ad, PC users are portrayed as gray, mindless drones blindly taking direction from a Big Brother-like character. . Then enters a young, fit, and attractive woman (representing Apple) who is heroic enough to smash the giant screen. Or how about the more recent ads featured the PC guy (wearing a suit and looking like a nerd) and the &quot;Mac,&rdquo; looking cool and competent? . That&rsquo;s how Apple created an enemy, the PC and its users. And they built that common enemy into much of their marketing. No wonder Apple has created an obsessive brand loyalty. . The bottom line is that having a common enemy will do wonders for your sales letter. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the next step in the process. . In the previous question, we revealed the real reason why your prospect has failed so far. Now it&rsquo;s time to blame someone or something for that. And we do that by answering the following question... . Question #5: Who/What is to Blame? . In order to find an effective enemy, you must understand your prospect. Instead of trying to create an enemy out of the blue, you must leverage existing beliefs. . For example, most financial newsletter buyers are conservatives who distrust the media and Wall Street and, of course, despise Democrats and liberals. For that reason, Obama, Hillary, Democrats, Wall Street bankers, and the biased media have all been effectively used as a common enemy. . In the anti-aging supplement niche, a lot of the prospects are older people who already believe prescription costs are out of control. Naturally, it&rsquo;s common to set up greedy pharmaceutical companies as the enemy. . Here&rsquo;s how I set up the rigged game on Wall Street as the common enemy in one of my sales letters: . &quot;Remember that famous line from the movie Wall Street... . When trader Gordon Gecko said... &lsquo;You&rsquo;re either on the inside or the outside.&rsquo; . Well, everyday investors like you and me have always been &lsquo;on the outside&rsquo;... . I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed this too, right? . Only insiders with access to special information were able to profit from those BIG one-day moves. . The little guy was simply left out of those big gains. . That rigged-game ends today....&rdquo; . And here&rsquo;s how I set up Democrats as the common enemy in another letter: . &quot;While Democrats and the corrupt liberal media are busy trying to destroy our country... . The Republican Congress has passed a groundbreaking new law that could benefit millions of REAL Americans like you. . You won&rsquo;t hear this from the disgraced mainstream media... . But a few everyday folks like you are already collecting extra income thanks to this new tax provision... . And collecting what I call &lsquo;Republican Checks.&rsquo; . Just look what happened with Kevin Larry, from Chicago. . He&rsquo;s set to collect a massive check for $44,577 this month. . Imagine if that happened to you.... . That&rsquo;s 34 times MORE money than the average monthly Social Security benefit. . No wonder Kevin has retired comfortably... . And now, instead of worrying about money, he says: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to pursue my personal interests full time.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Once you inject more emotion into your copy by attacking a common enemy, it&rsquo;s time to give them a strong reason to act right now. . Let&rsquo;s take a page from Hitler&rsquo;s book. . Chapter 8 . The One Sentence that Killed as Many as 21 Million People . &quot;Either the German people annihilate the Jews or the Jews will enslave them.&rdquo; Adolf Hitler . This one sentence killed millions of people. Yes, Hitler was a monster. He was also a master persuader. Did you ever stop to think how he convinced an entire nation to slaughter as many as 21 million people during his brutal 12-year Third Reich? . He applied several persuasion techniques in his speeches, like the one you see above. This powerful technique is known as the &quot;either-or&rdquo; fallacy. It&rsquo;s a sentence that drastically raises the stakes by creating a false dilemma in the mind of the audience. . By using that technique, Hitler made Germans believe they had no other option. They had to kill Jews. There was no compromise. . As a result, that sentence created an incredible sense of urgency among Germans. They had to act. . If this technique can make 70 million rational people engage in horrible atrocities, imagine what it could do your sales letter. . That&rsquo;s why the next question in the process is designed to create a false dilemma in the mind of your prospect with the &quot;either-or&rdquo; technique. . Here&rsquo;s the question... . Question #6: Why Now? . Studies show that whenever you try to persuade someone, you&rsquo;ll face four levels of resistance from your prospect. . The first one is reactance. That happens when your prospect feels like you&rsquo;re trying to limit their freedom to choose or act. Nobody likes losing their freedom. That&rsquo;s why high-pressure sales techniques often backfire. . And it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s often a bad idea to mention your product in the lead of your sales letter. Because if your prospects get even a whiff that you&rsquo;re trying to sell something, there&rsquo;s a high chance they&rsquo;ll close that page. . Just think about it... how do you feel when a salesperson rings your doorbell, and the moment you open the door they ask you: &quot;Would you like to buy...?&rdquo; Before they finish the sentence, you already want to slam the door in their face, right? That&rsquo;s reactance. . The second level of resistance is distrust. And that means your prospect will be skeptical of any claims you make. We&rsquo;ve already discussed how to overcome that with question #3. . As you&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter, Question #7 will also help destroy this persuasion barrier. . The third level is scrutiny. Your prospect will need to see proof. We all know that people buy on emotion and justify their emotional decision with logic. That&rsquo;s scrutiny. As you&rsquo;ll see later in this book, Question #8 is designed to break that barrier. . Finally, another face of resistance is inertia. You can make an incredible promise with tons of proof. But that&rsquo;s still not enough to make your prospect buy. That&rsquo;s because of inertia. Staying put is a lot easier than acting on something. We simply tend to resist change. . And that&rsquo;s where &quot;why now?&rdquo; comes in. . We need to start planting the seeds in your prospect&rsquo;s head that he&rsquo;s facing an &quot;either-or&rdquo; situation. Either you act now, or you&rsquo;ll miss out on this incredible opportunity. Either you act now, or you could lose everything. . The key here is to raise the stakes. Just having a date as a deadline is not enough. You need to trigger FOMO in your prospect. . You can start doing that in the lead, and throughout the promo, especially in the offer section. After teasing an urgent event on October 26 in one of my sales letters, here&rsquo;s how I revealed the details and raised the stakes: . &quot;In fact, I want you to mark October 26 on your calendar... . Because this single event is about to catapult cryptocurrencies into the third and most explosive stage of the boom. . I am certain that Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin. . They have no choice. And this will be the tipping point that will create massive generational wealth unlike we&rsquo;ve ever seen before. . Given the company&#39;s history of staying ahead of its retail rivals... . Amazon could make the announcement as early as October 26, at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call. . Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW. . Once they make this announcement, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. . We&rsquo;ll see a buying frenzy like never before. . It&#39;ll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best Buy. . Only those who get in early will get a good deal. . Most people will be left out. . That&rsquo;s why I urge you to get in right now... . Get ahead of the crowd... . Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies straight up.&rdquo; . See how I used the &quot;either-or&rdquo; technique to create massive urgency? Either you get in now, ahead of this big event, or you won&rsquo;t make any money. . For your next project, think about how you can use this lesson from Hitler to destroy inertia and get your prospect to act. . We&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground so far, so let&rsquo;s recap a bit. At this point, your prospects have been presented with a new opportunity. You&rsquo;ve shown evidence that this is real. You&rsquo;ve justified your prospects&rsquo; failure and established a common enemy. And you&rsquo;ve teased why they must act now. . But remember, distrust is one of the psychological barriers. Now it&rsquo;s time to show them why they should trust you. . Chapter 9 . How to Make Your Prospect Know, Trust, and Like You . . Secretary: &quot;Pan American airlines, can I help you?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Yes ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;d like to speak with someone in the purchasing department.&rdquo; . Secretary: &quot;One moment please&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;How can I help you?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;My name is John Black. I&rsquo;m a co-pilot with the company, based out of San Francisco. I&rsquo;ve been with the company seven years and I&rsquo;ve never had something like this come up before.&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Well, we flew in yesterday and we&rsquo;re going out today. Yesterday, I sent my uniform to my hotel to have it dry cleaned. Now the hotel and the cleaner said they can&rsquo;t find it. And I have to flight in 4 hours.&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;Don&rsquo;t you have a spare uniform?&rdquo; . Frank: &quot;Certainly, back home in San Francisco, but I&rsquo;d never get it in time for my flight&rdquo; . Clerk: &quot;Hold on.&quot; . A few minutes later... . Clerk: &quot;My supervisor says you need to go down to the Well-Built Uniform Company on 5th Avenue. They&rsquo;re our supplier. I&rsquo;ll call them and let them know you&rsquo;re on the way.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s how Frank Abagnale was able to get a Pan Am uniform, even though he couldn&rsquo;t fly a kite, let alone an airplane. . If you&rsquo;ve read the book or watched the movie Catch Me if You Can, you know the story. Pan Am estimates that between the ages of 16 and 18, Frank flew more than 1 million miles for free, boarded more than 250 commercial airlines and traveled to 26 countries around the world. He never once stepped onboard a Pan Am aircraft. . Instead, he abused the professional courtesy of other airlines to provide free transport for competing airline pilots if they had to move to another city at short notice. He only pulled this off because of that uniform. It gave him instant authority, just like white lab coats give doctors authority. It made people trust that he was a pilot with the airline. . And that&rsquo;s why authority is one of the key elements of persuasion, as you probably already know from Robert Cialdini&rsquo;s classic book. . And that&rsquo;s why the next question in the process is this... . Question #7: Why should I trust you? . This will be the credibility section of your sales letter. There are three main &quot;storylines&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found that work best to establish authority and make your prospect trust and like you. . The first and most powerful one is the &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; storyline. Then there are the Robin Hood and the expert storylines. . Let&rsquo;s take a look at each one. . The &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; Storyline . The goal here is to show your prospect that you (the guru, editor, etc.) went through the same challenges your prospect is facing right now. That at some point everything seemed lost. But then you discovered your new mechanism, and it changed everything. It helped you overcome all the challenges and achieve the same things your prospect desires. . This is powerful because you&rsquo;re indirectly talking about your prospect&rsquo;s deepest desires through your own story. You&rsquo;re painting the picture of how their life could be. But you&rsquo;re doing it in a very indirect way that will trigger no resistance from your prospect. . By telling your journey, your reader will think &quot;OMG, this guy is just like me. Finally, someone who gets it. That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going through right now. And he already achieved what I want.&rdquo; How can your prospect not trust that? . Here&rsquo;s how I did that in one of my sales letters that offered a penny stock advisory service. . I knew most of my prospects were frustrated with slow-moving stocks and not making much money with those &quot;safe&rdquo; stocks. I also knew most of them came from middle-class families. To make this even more powerful, I also added a testimonial/case study towards the end to show that anybody can do this. . Here&rsquo;s the copy: . &quot;You see, when I started investing... . I traded expensive, blue chip stocks because that&rsquo;s what everyone told me you had to do to get rich in the long run. . But those stocks move way too slow. My portfolio didn&rsquo;t move an inch for months at a time. . So I started trading penny stocks.... . And I started making 20%, 40%, 50% or more in profits... in a matter of days. . I also didn&rsquo;t start with a lot of money. . I grew up as a middle-class kid in a small rural town in Connecticut. . I wasn&rsquo;t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. . So penny stocks were perfect for someone like me... who wasn&rsquo;t rich yet. . But WANTED to get rich. . That&rsquo;s the beauty of penny stocks.... . You can start with very little money because they trade for pennies on the dollar.... . And because they&rsquo;re so explosive, you can make a fortune fast. . Look what happened to Tim Gritanni.... . When he started following my strategy a few years ago.... . He was selling insurance for State Farm... and he only had $1,500 to his name. . Today he&rsquo;s a multimillionaire.&rdquo; . The Robin Hood Storyline . As you know, the folkloric hero Robin Hood is a noble outlaw in Sherwood Forest who fights the oppressive evil of King John by robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. In this storyline, you will be &quot;stealing&rdquo; a secret from the rich and giving it to the reader. . This works even better if you accidently stumbled into a secret &quot;they didn&rsquo;t want you to know.&rdquo; And now for the first time ever you&rsquo;re blowing the whistle to level the playing field. . Here&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve used in one of my sales letters: . &quot;I&rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life trading derivatives on Wall Street. . As a 22-year old kid, I was already trading $100 million accounts.... . After that, the stakes only got higher. . At one point, I was personally making millions of dollars per year... . Going on annual ski trip to Switzerland, where I stayed at billionaire Richard Branson&#39;s chalet... . Attending lavish events, like the Grand Prix in Monaco... even the Kill Bill premiere in Cannes. . If you&rsquo;ve watched the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, you get the idea. . But no matter how much money I made... . I wasn&rsquo;t happy working on Wall Street. . Helping the rich getting richer and watching bankers screw the little guy wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling. . So after years of seeing the rotten machine from the inside... . I had finally had enough... . And decided to leave everything behind. . But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important... . When I left Wall Street I took an income secret with me... . One that I&rsquo;ve never revealed to anyone until today....&rdquo; . The Expert Storyline . If you can&rsquo;t use &quot;I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes&rdquo; or Robin Hood storylines, then your next best option is to position your main character as a guru by talking about his expertise. That includes books, TV appearances, experience, or any accomplishments that proves expertise in the field. . Here&rsquo;s an example from one of my sales letters: . &quot;I started my trading career in 1991, when I joined the Chicago Board of Trade right out of college. . And I&rsquo;ve spent the last 25 years on the trading floor... . Working through the ranks... from being a runner, phone clerk and broker... . All the way up to becoming a professional trader... . And a member of the Chicago Board of Trade... . Where I traded my own account on the floor... . And competed with the world&rsquo;s best traders. . You might have seen me on Bloomberg, CNBC, Fox Business, and other major financial news... . Where I&rsquo;m frequently invited to share my views on the market.&rdquo; . These storylines are not mutually exclusive. You can mix and match them when appropriate to make the story even more powerful. Once your prospect knows, trusts, and likes you, by this point they should be emotionally sold. . I know I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground so far. But on average I answer all these first seven question in the first 1/3 of the sales letter. Once the emotional sale is done, you&rsquo;re going to help your prospects justify their decision with solid logic. . It&rsquo;s time to show them how your new mechanism actually works. . Chapter 10 . How to Make Your Prospect Nod his Head and Think &quot;Yeah, that Makes Sense.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s a real conversation between a farmer and a doctor back in the 1920s: . Farmer: &quot;Doc, is there anything you can do for...you know... sexual weakness?&rdquo; . Doctor: &quot;Sorry, but there&rsquo;s nothing to be done for impotence.&rdquo; . Farmer, after noticing a male goat mounting a female goat through the window: &quot;It&rsquo;s too bad I don&rsquo;t have billy goat nuts. Say, Doc! Why don&rsquo;t you just put some goat nuts in me? Graft &lsquo;em on, like the way I graft Pound Sweet on an apple stray!&rdquo; . Doctor: &quot;Are you serious?&rdquo; . Farmer: &quot;Well, Doc, they can&rsquo;t be worse than the nuts I got. Just give it a try, and if it don&rsquo;t work, I sure as heck won&rsquo;t tell nobody.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s how one of the most bizarre stories in quackery began. If you&rsquo;ve read the great book from Dan Kennedy, Make Them Believe, you know the Brinkley story. . According to Dr. John Brinkley, that farmer&rsquo;s wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy nine months after the goat testicle transplant. The boy was named Billy (after the goat). . Goat testicle transplant. Talk about a brand- new mechanism. This worked because farmers (Dr. Brinkley&rsquo;s primary prospects) already believed goats were sexual dynamos. It was an accepted fact. . Heck, to this date, many people still believe that. It&rsquo;s why eating penises and testicles from donkeys, goats, and bulls is popular in certain parts of Asia. . Without that existing belief, Dr. Brinkley would probably have never pulled this off. Even though there was no scientific proof that his method worked, whenever he explained the mechanism, his prospects went &quot;yeah, that makes sense.&rdquo; . He channeled an existing belief (goats are sexual dynamos) to support what would otherwise be a ridiculous claim. . And that&rsquo;s your goal in this next step of the copy. You have to answer this next question in a way that will make your prospects nod their heads. . Here&rsquo;s the question... . Question #8: How does it work? . It&rsquo;s time to reveal how your new mechanism actually works. If you can do that by exploring an existing belief (like Dr. Brinkley did), it will make your copy stronger. . Now, we&rsquo;re not farmers back in the 1920s. Your prospects are a lot smarter now. Aside from exploring an existing belief, you better be able to explain your mechanism in a very logical way... in a way that will make you reader think &quot;oh yeah, that makes total sense.&rdquo; . Your prospect needs to understand exactly how your new mechanism gives him the end result you&rsquo;re promising. The key here is to remember that this proof and the explanation of your mechanism are also copy. As such, they cannot be boring. . That&rsquo;s a mistake I see many writers making. &nbsp;Remember, if you wrap the explanation of the mechanism in an ABT storytelling frame, your copy will be much easier for the reader to consume. . Here&rsquo;s how I answered that question in one of my sales letters that talked about a new tax law that would trigger repatriation of money. . That repatriation was my new mechanism. And I called it the &quot;cash for patriots program.&rdquo; My prospects were conservatives who already believed Trump was trying to do everything he could to &quot;make America great again.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s the copy: . &quot;There are literally trillions of dollars at stake. . I&rsquo;m talking about $27,718 on average for every American taxpayer. . In order to take advantage of this opportunity, it&rsquo;s important that you first understand where all this money is coming from. . The first thing you should know is that it doesn&rsquo;t come from the U.S. government. . Even though this is a government program, the money comes from the private sector. . The Trump administration is simply creating the conditions to unleash $2.6 trillion into the hands of everyday Americans. . You see, because the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s reserve currency... . Other countries around the world also use our currency. . For that reason, there are trillions of dollars circulating outside the U.S. . And the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has identified a stash of $2.6 trillion... mostly hiding in Ireland. . Trump&rsquo;s plan is designed to bring some of the cash back home. . In a recent speech to the Detroit Economic Club he said his administration will &lsquo;bring back trillions of dollars that is now parked overseas.&rsquo; . He believes that&rsquo;s money that belongs to American patriots. . It&rsquo;s part of his &lsquo;America comes first&rsquo; philosophy. . Why leave all the cash outside the U.S. if it can come home and help our citizens? . It&rsquo;s hard to argue with that argument. . In fact, BOTH Democrats and Republicans agree it&rsquo;s a good idea. . As Bloomberg says, &lsquo;[the cash for patriots program] may be one of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Notice how I explored an already existing belief. But I also added extra proof with the quotes from Trump himself and Bloomberg, a credible source. There&rsquo;s no way in hell my prospect will read this and think &quot;this makes no sense.&rdquo; . Once you show your prospect how your new mechanism works, they&rsquo;re ready to buy. They&rsquo;re pre- sold. . At this point, you&rsquo;ve proven that your new opportunity is the key to what they desire and it&rsquo;s only attainable through your new mechanism. . Now all you need to do is make a no-brainer offer. . Chapter 11 . From Flipping Burgers to Becoming the Richest Man Alive... All Thanks to a No- Brainer Offer . His first job was working at McDonald&rsquo;s in the summer, while also helping out his grandfather on his South Texas ranch. . After developing a no-brainer offer, this kid from Albuquerque, New Mexico, went from flipping burgers to becoming richer than Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. . It all started in his garage in 1994, when he read that the web had grown 2,300% in one year. He then made a list of 20 possible products to sell online. At the top of the list? Books. . Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. . Using scale and thin margins to offer unbeatable prices, Amazon seems to be taking over the world. Combine competitive prices with its shopping experience (1-Click checkout and fast doorstep delivery), and you got a no-brainer offer. . Who doesn&rsquo;t want to buy quality products for less money and receive them as fast as possible? With all the value they offer, you&rsquo;d have to be a moron NOT to shop on amazon.com. The key word here is &quot;value.&rdquo; . And that&rsquo;s where the next question of the process comes in. It&rsquo;s time to make an offer. But not just any offer. . You must answer the following question with a no-brainer offer... . Question #9: How can I get started? . Your goal here is to put together an offer so good (product/service, price, bonuses, guarantee) that will take your copy to a whole other level. In fact, if you can get your offer right, your copy doesn&rsquo;t even have to be top-notch. . As the saying goes, &quot;the product is mightier than the pen.&rdquo; So how can you make a no-brainer offer? . By creating a huge GAP between the value and the price. In order to accomplish that, you can either offer a ton of value or cut the price or do a combo of both. . Many businesses make the mistake of cutting their prices, and they end up making their products look &quot;cheap&rdquo; (&quot;with such a low price, this can&rsquo;t be good&rdquo;). They eventually price themselves out of existence. . Have you ever bought anything that was both the best in the industry and also the cheapest? No! You get what you pay for. And that&rsquo;s how your prospect thinks too. So lowering the price reduces the perceived value of your product and can actually reduce sales. . That&rsquo;s why the best option is to focus on increasing the value of your proposition. Lowering the price is for losers. Don&rsquo;t do it. . You can create the perception of value by comparing it with a higher-price product that could provide a similar solution. . For example, a hedge fund that provides a similar strategy would charge you $100,000. That way, you&rsquo;re anchoring the high price, creating the illusion that your offer is a really good deal. . You can also use scarcity (limiting the number of units available) to increase the perceived value and create urgency. . But the best way to add value to your offer is by adding bonus gifts. And I&rsquo;m not talking about just any bonuses that you slap together without giving it much thought. . Master online marketer Todd Brown talks about the importance of putting together what he calls S.I.N. Offers &mdash; superior, irresistible, and no-brainer. Here&rsquo;s how Todd explains the importance of bonuses: . &quot;The right way to construct your offer is to create your premiums specifically for the offer. Premiums should be so good and so valuable... They should demonstrate such exciting, compelling benefits... That your prospects would happily pay money for them!&rdquo; . Todd says the way you begin the construction of these premiums is by asking yourself... . &quot;What premiums would perfectly complement my main product and add enormous value to the offer?&rdquo; . Adding a few good bonuses to your offer will drive your value proposition through the roof. And it will allow you to use the value stack technique from Russell Brunson. What&rsquo;s the value stack? . You basically show the value (not the price) of each item you&rsquo;re offering and add them all up. The goal is to show a huge value that will make your final price offer look like a total give away. . For example, when you see that you&rsquo;re getting $23,450 worth of products for only $1,999, it&rsquo;s an offer that&rsquo;s really hard to pass up. . Once you offer a ton of value, then you want to eliminate the risk for your prospect with a money- back guarantee or other type of risk reversal (&quot;it will cost you nothing if you&rsquo;re not happy&rdquo;). . Here&rsquo;s a basic template for an offer that I like to use in my sales letters: . Reveal the special report (the main offer) . Introduce subscription service (you get the report when you join the service) . What others are saying (testimonials for the service) . False Close (Anchor a high price) . Extra Bonuses (Show how each bonus has value) . Value Stack (Show total value) . Final price (Cut the value and reveal final price) . Guarantee (Risk reversal) . Assuming you did everything right up to this point, all you have to do now is finish strong and avoid a big mistake I see a lot of people making in the closing. . Are you making that mistake? Check out the next chapter for the answer. . Chapter 12 . It&rsquo;s Time to Close with the Powerful Push-Pull Technique . Here&rsquo;s advice from a famous pickup artist on how to seduce &quot;a legit 10&rdquo; at a bar: . &quot;Let&rsquo;s say she has long nails which are most likely fake. Now why do 10s dress so FINE if they don&rsquo;t want the attention? Sometimes they LOVE the feeling of control. . They are in a club with friends and they want to be the leader of the circle (social hierarchy in primates) and so she gets all the attention. . The guys come and buy drinks for them and she gets off on knocking the guys down. It&rsquo;s all in a day&rsquo;s play. . Ok, so she is wearing fake nails to look even BETTER! Most guys will say, &quot;Wow you are so beautiful!&rdquo; . BORING, typical and in her mind by now, TRUE. . Imagine now, a guy comes along and says &quot;Nice nails. Are they real?&rdquo; . She will have to concede, &quot;No, acrylic.&rdquo; . And he says (like he didn&rsquo;t notice it was a put down), &quot;Oh. (Pause) well I guess they still LOOK good.&rdquo; . Then he turns his back to her.&rdquo; . This comes straight from Mystery, the famous pick-up artist featured in the book The Game. Have you ever come across as &quot;too needy&rdquo; when approaching a girl? &nbsp;I know I have. . And in those cases, my failure rate was 100%. Nobody likes a needy person. . As my buddy Oren Klaff likes to say, &quot;people want what they can&rsquo;t have, they chase what moves away from them, and they only value that which they pay for.&rdquo; . The same way you can turn a hot woman off by being too needy, you can turn your prospect off if you sound too desperate for the sale. . And that&rsquo;s exactly a mistake many copywriters make at the closing. . They&rsquo;re so desperate for those royalties... so desperate to close the sale... so desperate to finally have that blockbuster hit they&rsquo;ve been dreaming about... that it shows in the copy. . They&rsquo;re basically begging the prospect to buy. And that&rsquo;s the last thing you want to do in the offer section. . So what should you do? You should take a page from the pickup artist playbook and alternate between . attraction and disinterest signals in a push-pull fashion. . First, you&rsquo;re going to push your prospect away by making them feel they&rsquo;re in control. It&rsquo;s their decision. They have options. Maybe this is not even right for them. . Then pull them back in by reminding them of what&rsquo;s at stake. Paint the picture of what they have to lose if they don&rsquo;t act. . It&rsquo;s time to answer the last question of the process... . Question #10: What do I have to lose? . Remember, we started this whole process with the one belief. By now, your prospect either believes it or you have no chance of selling. So remind him how your new opportunity is the key to what he desires and that it&rsquo;s only attainable through your new mechanism. . Then, raise the pain levels by painting the picture of how his life will remain the same if he doesn&rsquo;t act. Whatever problem he has will not be solved. The key here is not to be needy and to let your prospect decide for himself. . Here&rsquo;s how I closed one of my letters: . &quot;Look, you&rsquo;ve seen how you could have made weekend profits of $8,780, $9,100 or even $15,820... All by using my simple weekend strategy. .

With a performance guarantee that fully covers the price of your subscription. . Now it&rsquo;s time for a decision. . The Way I See It You Have Three Options... . Option #1: Do absolutely nothing and stay exactly where you are right now. . If you already have enough to retire and you&rsquo;re not worried about running out of money during your golden years... . Then maybe you don&rsquo;t need this weekend strategy. . But if you&rsquo;d like to make some extra income on the weekends, that leaves you with two other options... . Option #2: Do it yourself. . You can try to keep track of all the millions of financial news and blog posts that are published every day... . Then try to analyze all the 1,887 stocks that are currently trading below $5... .

I&rsquo;ll put my proven news filtering system to work for you. . I&rsquo;ll do the legwork and send you my research and video alerts. . All you need to do is read my research and place the trade on a Friday if you decide to invest... . Go enjoy your weekend... . Then come back on Monday to collect your profits. . Of these three options, ask yourself... What&rsquo;s Going to Be Easier for You? . You see, there are two types of people in this world... . Those who only dream about achieving their financial goals without ever taking any action to make it happen... . And those who are ready to take action when the opportunity presents itself. . Most people will tell you they want to retire rich. . But we both know very few actually make it happen. . It&rsquo;s a natural law of financial wealth.... . The classic tale of the willful and the wishful. . Most people will keep dreaming... . While the few who are actually serious about their financial future will take action. . Since you&rsquo;ve watched my entire presentation this far, I think you&rsquo;re one of the few special ones... . One of the 250 people I&rsquo;m looking for. .

Only you can decide.&rdquo; . Notice how I only presented the options, without trying to convince the prospect which one he should choose. I&rsquo;ve created the illusion that he&rsquo;s in control. . Then I painted the picture that nothing would change in his life if he didn&rsquo;t act. But I did that without being needy. Instead, I created the impression that I couldn&rsquo;t care less what he decides to do. . That&rsquo;s how you want to finish the letter. Remember, people chase what moves away from them. . Chapter 13 . Putting it All Together . We&rsquo;ve reached the end of the road. Even though it seems we covered a lot, this is a very simple process. It&rsquo;s designed to get you thinking before you write a single piece of copy. . In fact, when I mentor writers in my team, I highly encourage them to write down the one belief for the promo idea... and try to answer at least the first seven question with just a couple of lines. . I do that myself with every single promotion I write. And I&rsquo;ve found that very helpful. It&rsquo;s a way to map out the entire promotion in 5-10 minutes. . Then all you need to do is research and start writing on the appropriate sections. . Remember the 16-word sales letter&trade; that helped me sell $120 million+ in the last two years... . &quot;The secret to converting copy is to define the one belief, then answer these ten questions.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s the one belief... . This new opportunity is the key to their desire and it&rsquo;s attainable only through my new mechanism. . Here are the ten questions... . Question #1: How is this different from everything else I&rsquo;ve seen? | Question #2: What&rsquo;s in it for me? | Question #3: How do I know this is real? | Question #4: What&rsquo;s holding me back? | Question #5: Who/What is to blame? | Question #6: Why now? | Question #7: Why should I trust you? | Question #8: How does it work? | Question #9: How can I get started? | Question #10: What do I have to lose? | . Here&rsquo;s what to do next... . As you know, writing copy is a very complex process. The market is always evolving... new techniques emerge... the environment change. . There&rsquo;s always something new to learn... . Which is why what I&rsquo;ve showed you here is just the tip of the iceberg. . If you&rsquo;d like to stay on top of your game... . Go to www.dailyinsidersecrets.com&nbsp;and sign up for my FREE daily letter... . Where each day my business partner Peter Coyne and I reveal secrets that are working inside a $1.5 billion online marketing giant. . Signing up for my daily email is a great way to stay in touch. . Let me know how the 16-word sales letter&trade; is working for you. If you&rsquo;re interested in working with me, let me know as well. I&rsquo;m always looking for talent. . Good luck! . About Evaldo Albuquerque . After getting a degree in Finance, Evaldo joined one of Agora subsidiaries as a research analyst. After four years as an editor, he finally realized copy was the soul of the business and decided to become a copywriter. . He&rsquo;s been writing copy for Agora Financial since 2014. . He was the top seller copywriter in Agora Financial in 2017. . In 2018, he broke Agora&rsquo;s financial record of most sales in a year, with over $80 million in sales. He&rsquo;s now considered one of the best copywriters in the world. He&rsquo;s the copy chief for Paradigm Press (the largest Agora Financial imprint), where he manages a (growing) team of 12 copywriters. . . Acknowledgements . I could not have written this book without the support of a handful of people. . Big thanks to Justin Ford, who hired me and introduced me to the Agora world. I never forgot the first thing you taught me: &quot;The secret to great writing is rewriting.&rdquo; . Big thanks to my former boss Erika Nolan. &nbsp;When I decided to learn more about copy, you were 100% behind me and helped me anyway you could. . Big thanks to Oren Klaff and Blair Warren. Both of your books (Pitch Anything and The One Sentence Persuasion) have greatly influenced how I write copy. . Big thanks to my business partner and publisher of Paradigm Press, Peter Coyne. Although you&rsquo;re 10 years younger than me, you&rsquo;ve always been an inspiration. Our discussions in your office gave me the clarity I needed to develop my own system and actually put stuff on paper. . Last but not least, big thanks to Joe Schriefer, publisher of Agora Financial.

Example . # Color scheme currently only supports &quot;dark&quot; or nil (default) color_scheme: &quot;dark&quot; . Preview dark color scheme . Specific visual customization . To customize your site’s aesthetic, open _sass/custom/custom.scss in your editor to see if there is a variable that you can override. Most styles like fonts, colors, spacing, etc. are derived from these variables. To override a specific variable, uncomment its line and change its value. . For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, open _sass/custom/custom.css and find the $link-color variable on line 50. Uncomment it, and change its value to our $blue-000 variable, or another shade of your choosing. . Example . // ... // // $body-text-color: $grey-dk-100; // $body-heading-color: $grey-dk-300; $link-color: $blue-000; // // ... . Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. . Override styles . For styles that aren’t defined as a variables, you may want to modify specific CSS classes. To add your own CSS overrides at the end of the cascade, edit _sass/overrides.scss. This will allow for all overrides to be kept in a single file, and for any upstream changes to still be applied. . For example, if you’d like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles. . Example . // Print-only styles. @media print { .side-bar, .page-header { display: none; } .main-content { max-width: auto; margin: 1em;} } .",

    "content": "Navigation Structure . . Main navigation | Ordering pages | Excluding pages | Pages with children Child pages | Auto-generating Table of Contents | Children with children | | Auxiliary Navigation | In-page navigation with Table of Contents | . Main navigation . The main navigation for your Just the Docs site is on the left side of the page at large screens and on the top (behind a tap) on small screens. The main navigation can be structured to accommodate a multi-level menu system (pages with children and grandchildren). . By default, all pages will appear as top level pages in the main nav unless a parent page is defined (see Pages with Children). . . Ordering pages . To specify a page order, use the nav_order parameter in your pages’ YAML front matter. . Example . layout: default title: Customization nav_order: 4 . . Excluding pages . For specific pages that you do not wish to include in the main navigation, e.g. a 404 page or a landing page, use the nav_exclude: true parameter in the YAML front matter for that page. . Example . layout: default title: 404 nav_exclude: true . . Pages with children . Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) | |-- docs | |-- ui-components | | |-- index.md (parent page) | | |-- buttons.md | | |-- code.md | | |-- labels.md | | |-- tables.md | | +-- typography.md | | | |-- utilities | | |-- index.md (parent page) | | |-- color.md | | |-- layout.md | | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | | +-- typography.md | | | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. | |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. . On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. . Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). . Example . layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. . Example . layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. . Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | Example . layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true . layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 . This would create the following navigation structure: . +-- .. | |-- UI Components | |-- .. | | | |-- Buttons | | |-- Button Child Page | | | |-- .. | +-- .. . . Auxiliary Navigation . To add a auxiliary navigation item to your site (in the upper right on all pages), add it to the aux_nav configuration option in your site’s _config.yml file. . Example . # Aux links for the upper right navigation aux_links: &quot;Just the Docs on GitHub&quot;: - &quot;//github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs&quot; . . In-page navigation with Table of Contents . To generate a Table of Contents on your docs pages, you can use the {:toc} method from Kramdown, immediately after an &lt;ol&gt; in Markdown. This will automatically generate an ordered list of anchor links to various sections of the page based on headings and heading levels. There may be occasions where you’re using a heading and you don’t want it to show up in the TOC, so to skip a particular heading use the {: .no_toc } CSS class. . Example . # Navigation Structure {: .no_toc } ## {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} . This example skips the page name heading (#) from the TOC, as well as the heading for the Table of Contents itself (##) because it is redundant, followed by the table of contents itself. .",

    "title": "Take Their Money",
    "content": "Take Their Money - S . TAKE THEIR MONEY . Kyle Milligan &nbsp; . &nbsp; . Introduction . The Big Message Behind This Book: . Here&rsquo;s the single most important theme and idea for this guide: . Copywriting is a language. . Consider copywriting a &ldquo;professional language,&rdquo; like accounting. . Accounting is considered &ldquo;the language of business.&rdquo; . And copywriting has been referred to as &ldquo;salesmanship in print&hellip;&rdquo; So it makes sense to consider copywriting the &ldquo;language of sales.&rdquo; More specifically, it is the language of emotion. . Because emotions are what make people buy things. . For me, it has been effective to learn copywriting the way you&rsquo;d learn a new language, say Spanish. . (For the purposes of this book, assume you absolutely cannot read or speak any Spanish. . It will make all my examples a lot easier) . If you&rsquo;ve never tried to learn a new language, here&rsquo;s how the education process usually goes&hellip; . The instructors will start with some basics&hellip; . Then they will add some stuff on top, while they continue to repeat and reinforce past lessons and basics over and over. . It is the brute force repetition that makes the language stick. . But nobody teaches copywriting as a language to practice. . Instead they teach it like putting together a piece of furniture. . &ldquo;Do this. . Then do that. . Fill in this template.&rdquo; . We will not do that inside this guide. . We will establish a few core principles, then expand on them over and over and over. . In fact, you may find parts of this guide repetitive. . That is by design. . Once the emotions of the copywriting language are DRILLED into your memory through continuous practice and repetition... . Then you really just need to consume as much of the language as possible. . Soon you&rsquo;ll start to recognize patterns&hellip; . And then what started as reciting your &ldquo;ABC&rsquo;s&rdquo; and numbers &ldquo;one through ten&rdquo; will evolve into simple objects, then simple sentences&hellip; . Until you are ordering your own food at a restaurant and telling jokes in &ldquo;Spanish.&rdquo; This guide will help you develop skills in a similar way for copywriting. . At first you will need to think about what you are doing&hellip; . But not for long. . In no time it will all be second nature. . Most Gurus Only Get You Halfway There . Imagine if instead of teaching you Spanish, I just gave you some of the most common phrases Spanish people say and told you to &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; for whatever you need. . That&rsquo;s what a lot of &ldquo;copywriting training&rdquo; has become. . Email templates, headline templates&hellip; . Garbage. . And sometimes gurus accidentally teach copywriting concepts without realizing that they are really speaking in jargon that comes loaded with assumptions that were never explained! . That&rsquo;s because from the outside, it looks like gurus are speaking in simple English when they teach&hellip; . That&rsquo;s the deception of copywriting&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; appearance. . For example, they say you should write &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; when you write your copy. . But your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come automatically imbued with salesmanship&hellip; . That is, your &ldquo;conversationally&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t automatically create intrigue&hellip; . Or automatically present a new and novel idea&hellip; . Or automatically communicate a sense of safety, ease, or urgency or scarcity! You see, the language of copywriting is found in the subtext, not the text. . Copywriting is an emotional language where the words on the page do not matter as much as you&rsquo;d think! . Because the emotional part of the brain is triggered by the unwritten subtext. . The subtext is inferred, not spoken. . Put another way, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate.&rdquo; . If your words are conversational, but don&rsquo;t communicate important, specific subtext, then you are speaking English&hellip; . NOT copywriting. . If this sounds complicated, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; . This guide is designed specifically to clear all of that up for you. . And it will also offer you all the tools you need to master the language of copywriting. . What&rsquo;s important is if you have been buying tons of books and courses only to find that your copywriting skills haven&rsquo;t improved&hellip; . It&rsquo;s not your fault. . Nobody teaches this subject as what it is... . A unique language of its own that requires continuous practice. . Why Templates And Regular Copywriting Books Fail You . So back to our Spanish example. . Say you&rsquo;re ordering food at a restaurant. . The server is speaking only in Spanish. . You need help. . Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m there too, and I tell you exactly what to say to the server. . You repeat what I taught you perfectly! . Should you be happy? . You&rsquo;re probably not satisfied. . Because when you really think about it&hellip; . You only have the ability to say those couple words in that specific context, to that specific person, at that specific moment in time. . And even though you recognized a few of the sounds from Spanish books you&rsquo;ve read, you still don&rsquo;t really understand what you or the server said in the first place&hellip; . And here&rsquo;s the real kicker&hellip; . You have no concept or system to help you understand HOW I decided to say what I said, instead of&nbsp;saying something completely different... . Sure, the words made sense after you heard them&hellip; . But how can you come up with them? . That&rsquo;s the problem with reading regular copywriting books and following templates. . You KNOW that you are supposed to grab attention. . You KNOW that you are supposed to build intrigue. . You KNOW that you need to create urgency&hellip; . BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY?!?!?!?!?! . How the hell do you make this influence trigger&hellip; . TRIGGER?! . So if you&rsquo;ve read a bunch of copywriting books and still lack total and complete confidence in your copywriting, now you know why. . It&rsquo;s not your fault. . This book is going change that for you, once and for all. . Becoming A Great Copywriter - The Daily Practice . To become a great copywriter, and to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting, there are three things you must do. . I am &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; this checklist from Joe Schriefer, the publisher at Agora Financial and all around awesome dude. . The Daily Practice: . Read a piece of copy a day | Write a page of copy a day | Come up with an idea a day | Read a Piece of Copy a Day . When you read a piece of copy, you should practice &ldquo;active reading.&rdquo; Passive reading is what the majority of people do when they read. . The passive reader just absorbs the material and questions nothing within. . Your task as an active reader is to tease out subtext and try to infer the writer&rsquo;s purpose behind what was written. . This entire guide is dedicated to teaching you professional level active reading skills. . Write a Page of Copy A Day . Writing a page of copy a day isn&rsquo;t as daunting as it sounds. . Simply write a page of copy. . It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for a big project, though it can be. . It could be a series of five short emails that you sum up into one page. . And you don&rsquo;t have to use this page of copy you wrote. . If you want, you can throw your page away after you write it. . You could also just hand-copy a page of copy from a successful copywriter. . Sometimes I do that, then active read and mark up what I wrote. . Don&rsquo;t get too hung up on this stuff. . The benefit is in the daily practice and engagement with the language of copywriting. . Come Up With An Idea A Day . When coming up with an idea a day, you should not be hunting for a &ldquo;big idea.&rdquo; For instance, your one idea could be a simple way to improve a sales process&hellip; . A cool subject line for an email&hellip; . It could be anything, really. . Just try to stay in the habit of asking &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo; as often as possible. . I know you&rsquo;ll easily check this item off every day&hellip; . Everything in this guide will open your eyes and mind to a brand-new way of perceiving everything you read&hellip; . Particularly text within advertising and marketing materials. . So you will have plenty of ideas. . Of this I&rsquo;m sure. . What You Should Expect From This Guide&hellip; . The purpose of this guide is to give you the tools you need to immerse yourself in the language of copywriting and expedite your progress towards mastery over the language. . In this guide we will move through the common components of a full, long-form direct response sales letter. . We will cover the subtext that must be communicated by the copywriter, with examples of how some of the best copywriters in the world do it. . The lessons will build on each other, so easy to grasp patterns will emerge quickly for you. . Before we cover the different sections of copy, I need to explain how to active read&hellip; . Without knowing what to look for and how to perform active reading, the rest of this guide is worthless. . Active Reading- What To Look For When Reading A Piece of Copy . Copywriting is a language . Copywriting is a language communicated purely through subtext. . Therefore, when you are reading copy you are not looking for clever turns of phrase or &ldquo;mind control lines.&rdquo; . The words aren&rsquo;t important. . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . When reading a piece of copy, you are looking for what the copywriter is actually trying to communicate. . How I Discovered the Language . You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that everything I&rsquo;m going to show you in this guide already helped me generate well over $7.1 million in sales in a single year as a copywriter at Agora Financial. . And don&rsquo;t think for a minute that I had a clue what I was doing when I got hired. . I probably knew less about copywriting than you know now. . I was as green as they come. . But I was eager to learn copywriting fast so I could make a million bucks, so I asked this question on my first day: . &ldquo;What books should I read? I&rsquo;ve read The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert and The Ultimate Sales Letter by Dan Kennedy&hellip; . What else?&rdquo; . The reply: . &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to read any of that stuff&hellip; . Don&rsquo;t read about copy. . Just read copy.&rdquo; That was a disappointing answer for me at the time&hellip; . But it has turned out to be the most fundamental truth about learning copywriting fast&hellip; . And the most important step to becoming a great copywriter. . Lesson: . If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about Spanish&hellip; . Simply read Spanish. . And if you want to learn how to speak copywriting, don&rsquo;t read a ton of books about copywriting&hellip; . Just read copywriting. . The fastest way to normalize the language of copywriting, and internalize it in your brain, is to read it every single day. . &ldquo;Actively&rdquo; Read a Piece of Copy a Day . It&rsquo;s not good enough to simply read a piece of copy every day. . You must practice active reading. . That is, you read with purpose. . You&rsquo;ll read with pen in hand, discovering and marking patterns that will make writing your own copy much, much easier... . And you&rsquo;ll look for new and novel lines the writer used that will inspire new, original ideas for when you&rsquo;re writing your own copy. . This guide is going to give you the tools to perform active reading like a champ. . It&rsquo;s All About The Patterns&hellip; . Since I work in direct response and typically write long-form sales letters, that&rsquo;s where our focus will be. . But don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; . Even if you don&rsquo;t write long-form sales letters, you can rest assured that the emotions you will learn in just a moment will make you great at any style or length of copywriting. . Because this guide is not designed to tell you WHAT to write. . Instead you&rsquo;ll learn how to speak the language itself&hellip; . This guide will shine a light on the secret patterns of the copywriting language, and soon they will be second nature to you. . I can&rsquo;t stress enough: . Recognizing patterns is one of the most critical lessons of reading copywriting daily. . Binging Copywriting And The Walking Dead . So here&rsquo;s an example&hellip; . I used to love watching &ldquo;The Walking Dead.&rdquo; Until I binged a season or two in a matter of days. . Then I could predict almost exactly when the zombies would appear&hellip; . And I knew the elements that would lead right up to the characters becoming trapped and then narrowly escaping. . I picked up on cues in the directing that gave away what was coming because the set ups were always so similar. . In fact, after binging two seasons, I felt like I could write an episode myself. . Opening scene&hellip; . So and so is injured or incapacitated in some way&hellip; . we need supplies / or a specific rare item&hellip; . Go on supply run&hellip; . everything is fine&hellip; . supply run goes bad/some idiot makes a loud noise&hellip; . Zombies appear out of nowhere&hellip; . roof falls in&hellip; . heroes are overwhelmed by army of zombies suddenly&hellip; . Someone gets grabbed&hellip; . they almost get bit&hellip; . they narrowly escape. . You just change the characters and locations&hellip; . And with some limited exceptions, the chain of events I just described appeared in similar fashion regularly in the show (from what I remember). . And it isn&rsquo;t that The Walking Dead creators aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;clever&rdquo; enough. . They knew exactly how to speak to their viewers&rsquo; emotions and captivate their audience. . That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the show is so successful. . But it&rsquo;s also why some regular patterns emerged. . You want to expedite your ability to recognize and deconstruct those types of patterns in copywriting. . The language of copywriting is designed for one function: to speak directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions&hellip; . So the sooner you can recognize the patterns within the language, the sooner YOU can manipulate those patterns to do the same yourself. . If I wanted to write my own episode of The Walking Dead I&rsquo;d binge episodes of The Walking Dead and copy what works. . Same thing with copywriting. . Once you &ldquo;binge&rdquo; enough copy, it takes the work out of writing it. . The words will flow from you naturally. . You&rsquo;ll just know what should come next. . As some folks put it, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . Before You Can Ever Perform Active Reading . Unfortunately, you cannot simply binge copywriting and recognize the patterns. . It won&rsquo;t work. . Remember, copywriting is a completely foreign language... . It is the hidden subtext that speaks directly to the reader&rsquo;s emotions. . You can&rsquo;t just read the words and pick it up. . The critical reading skills you learned in school won&rsquo;t help you here. . So humble yourself now&hellip; . Do not think because copy is written in simple, basic, English words that it can be understood via traditional reading comprehension. . Without a decoder like this guide, binging copywriting would be like trying to read a million Spanish novels without some way to translate. . Even if you binge read all the Spanish novels in the world, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand anything more about the language without a way to translate it. . And you would be no closer to your goal of speaking Spanish fluently. . Important: . Binging is critical to learning and recognizing patterns. . But binging a foreign language is useless without a decoder. . This guide will serve as your decoder, unlocking your ability to binge copywriting and thus pick up the language rapidly. . | . Copywriting. Must. Be. Translated. . There is a TON going on &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; in copy. . Smoke and mirrors stuff. . You think you are reading one thing&hellip; . but you really are not. . And often, if you aren&rsquo;t very specifically searching and actively reading&hellip; . You may totally overlook a sales trigger or persuasion tactic that is subliminally being planted. . Active reading allows you to break down a piece of copy and pull out those tricks. . Active reading is a &ldquo;translator&rdquo; for teasing the subliminal subtext (i.e. . the REAL messages) out of the copy. . &nbsp; . &ldquo;The Big 4&rdquo; &ndash; The Subtext Beneath All Copywriting . In just a moment we will go deeper into active reading and dive into the different sections of copy&hellip; . But first, you must understand four crucial emotions and how they operate within a work of copy. . Because these four emotions are present in the entire body of copy&hellip; . From the first word of the headline, down to last word in the P.S.. . Every word of copywriting is specifically designed and choreographed to serve what I call: The &ldquo;The Big 4.&rdquo; . Basically, in great copy there are four main sentiments or emotions you want to trigger in your reader&rsquo;s mind&hellip; . These 4 do that&hellip; . Or &ldquo;are&rdquo; that. . And each of The Big 4 comes in a pair. . Think of each item as having an &ldquo;alter ego.&rdquo; . The alter ego is similar to the original emotion, but dressed up and comes with super powers. . Like Clark Kent and Superman. . Or Peter Parker and Spider-Man if you prefer Marvel (I do)&hellip; . Anyways, you get it. . When applied correctly, alter egos can function as persuasion multipliers, or &ldquo;amplifiers.&rdquo; I know, this might sound complicated, but trust me, it&rsquo;s really simple. . I promise. . Look&hellip; . Here are The Big 4: . New | Easy | Safe | Big | . And here they are with their alter egos attached: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast | . NESB . A quick and easy mnemonic device you can use to recall the Big 4 is NESB (nes-bee). . Let&rsquo;s dive into these, because they are the gas that drives every word of the copywriting machine. . The Big 4 are the subtext overlooked while regular people are reading copy with their&hellip; regular eyes. . I hope you&rsquo;re excited&hellip; . This is your first step into translating the incredible and powerful language of copywriting. . New . New is the single most important emotion to drive a successful piece of copy. . People are highly skeptical of advertising and they have very short attention spans. . The most direct way to combat their fickle attention is to put something &ldquo;new and novel&rdquo; in front of them. . It must be something they&rsquo;ve truly never seen before... . Or they will walk away from your pitch before you can even make it. . To frame how important &ldquo;New&rdquo; is&hellip; . Just remember this phrase: &ldquo;categorization is DEATH.&rdquo; . If the reader ever feels they can label your message as something they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;seen before&hellip;&rdquo; . Or even label your message as SIMILAR to something they&rsquo;ve seen before&hellip; . They think: “This is just like that thing I saw yesterday…” . Then you and your copy are DEAD. . BURIED. . Treat &ldquo;New&rdquo; with that level of mortal seriousness. . I&rsquo;m serious. . I cannot stress this enough. . Your reader must never be able to say, &ldquo;I know exactly what this is, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo; Copywriting speaks directly toward the emotional center of the brain. . The &ldquo;lizard brain&rdquo; as some call it. . And that is the most fickle and lazy part of the brain. . It does NOT want to spend any effort on attention. . The lizard brain wants to quickly categorize anything that crosses its path as either a threat, something to eat, or something to ignore. . That way it can go back to doing nothing. . Do NOT let the lizard brain categorize your copywriting as something to ignore. . You combat that by weaving New into the subtext of your copywriting. . This guide will purposefully not offer you &ldquo;step 1, 2, 3,&rdquo; to accomplish this. . This guide will not tell you what to write. . Remember, this guide is your translator&hellip; . It will help you recognize the patterns hidden in the subtext of the words that you once thought were just regular words. . And now you know about this one, single emotion, &ldquo;New&hellip;&rdquo; . You will now see the following words POP out at your face and smack you in the eye balls when you look at copy&hellip; . Breakthrough | Revolutionary | Discovery | Game Changing | Disruptive | NEW | Announcing | Revealed | Breaking | . You&rsquo;ve probably seen these words listed as &ldquo;power words&rdquo; in a blog post before. . But what is their power? What does it matter? . They convey &ldquo;New&rdquo;. . They tell the lizard brain, &ldquo;Hey, ya bastard. . You can&rsquo;t categorize and ignore me. . I&rsquo;ve gotcha.&rdquo; . And now your brain will automatically translate these &ldquo;regular words&rdquo; for what they really mean&hellip; . The subtext they really convey&hellip; . And you will immediately understand their true purpose in copywriting. . They tell the reader, &ldquo;You actually have NOT seen this before. . Keep reading to discover what it is&hellip;&rdquo; Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll understand what the copywriter who wrote them understands&hellip; . &ldquo;Categorization is DEATH.&rdquo; . If something is breakthrough, it is new. . If it is revolutionary&hellip; . It is new. . If it is a game changer&hellip; . it is new. . Again, all these words convey, &ldquo;You do not know what this is because it is brand new.&rdquo; . Why Is &ldquo;New&rdquo; So Important? . We&rsquo;re going to go just a little deeper than I planned&hellip; . But I think this is very, very important. . This touches on the psychology of the reader. . If you are offering a widget to a reader, you are offering them some sort of &ldquo;value.&rdquo; The &ldquo;value&rdquo; is that your widget solves a problem or provides some benefit. . Basic stuff, right? . And that&rsquo;s where many copywriting guides might stop, but not this one... . If you are selling a problem solver widget, chances are your reader has had this problem for a while&hellip; . And what&rsquo;s worse&hellip; . Nothing has ever worked for them before. . They&rsquo;ve probably bought a widget for this problem before, and it failed them. . So they still have the problem&hellip; . They are now keenly aware and averse to what doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip; . And they are still looking for that magic bullet / magic pill / one secret that will finally solve their problem. . If you put the &ldquo;same&rdquo; solution that they&rsquo;ve seen before, they KNOW there is no hope that it will work. . They have tried that. . And they assume that to indulge in reading your copy will just result in more disappointment. . So they won&rsquo;t waste their time. . But if the copy conveys this is BRAND NEW, then there is hope for them. . This could be the thing. . This could finally be it. . Finally, the solution to their problems. . Something new = hope. . So the emotion of New isn&rsquo;t just about holding attention to learn what the new thing is. . Many beginner copywriters believe intrigue alone will propel readers to continue reading. . But that&rsquo;s not New&rsquo;s true purpose. . New isn&rsquo;t just a set of &ldquo;power words.&rdquo; . Even though New does hold attention, and New does have power&hellip; . It&rsquo;s power comes from one thing NOBODY talks about&hellip; . New offers &ldquo;hope.&rdquo; . Hope that finally, the one thing that they have been searching for is in front of them. . New and Novel . One more thing on the topic of New&hellip; . New is NEW and NOVEL. . New is NOT just a &ldquo;better version of xyz.&rdquo; Do not get the two confused. . As the famous copywriter, Ryan McGrath, taught me at Agora Financial: New and different is better than &ldquo;better.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s a couple lines of real life copywriting that demonstrate New&hellip; . Dear Reader, . Hello, I&#39;m Dr. Kent Moors. . I&#39;m reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history... . And the last time was more than a century ago. . The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now... . - . This excerpt is from a sales letter by Money Map Press. . The headline is: . Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker . I&rsquo;ve dissected this promo on my YouTube. . Since you&rsquo;re probably reading this as a digital copy, I&rsquo;ll give you the URL to that YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/Fv7zwDItHlk . Copy and paste that link and you can see me dissect the entire sales letter for free. . Also, you can have access to my entire swipe file with my notes in the margins by going to: http://kylethewriter.com/swipe . I don&rsquo;t want to make sales pitches inside a book you paid money for, but I thought you might be interested in these free resources. . Any copywriting I use as an example in this book will be available through my swipe file link. . | . Sound like something you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;heard before?&rdquo; Probably not. . This is a &ldquo;world-changing new liquid.&rdquo; New. . New&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Only&rdquo; . Only is a very simple emotion to grasp&hellip; . You can &ldquo;Only get this solution here, through me, on this page.&rdquo; . To say you can only get something on this page means&hellip; . &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t bought this before on this page, then you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; To say you can only get something through me, means it is unique and proprietary to me. . So the subtext is, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t sell you this thing, you haven&rsquo;t bought anything like this before.&rdquo; These ideas convey the same sentiment as &ldquo;New.&rdquo; . Which, again, is: &ldquo;this is different.&rdquo; But more powerfully. . Only amplifies New. . New is Peter Parker and Only is Spider-Man. . Got it? . Here are some key words that should jump out and let you know the subtext of the copywriting is communicating the Only emotion: . Exclusive | Patented | Only here | Proprietary | . You&rsquo;ll be able to automatically translate these words for what they really mean&hellip; . Because you understand that these are not just &ldquo;power words&hellip;&rdquo; . But that these words convey the benefit of exclusiveness&hellip; . They convey New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . Nothing is as important as New. . New is the source of hope. . Tap into that, and you have already won. . Here&rsquo;s an example of Only taken from my first front-end promo I wrote for James Altucher and his service, The Altucher Report, at Agora Financial. . The promo was called, The Hottest IPO. . Dear Reader, . See this document I&rsquo;m holding in my hand? It&rsquo;s called The Pre-IPO Prospectus. . It&rsquo;s the only document in the world that contains details of a pre-IPO strategy that could help you make a fortune from this private company&rsquo;s explosive growth&hellip; . BEFORE it goes public! . | . Right away we establish that this is a brand New opportunity that is Only available through us! . Easy . Nobody likes work. . If they did, everyone you knew when you were little and at school would be massively successful and rich today. . If for some reason I can&rsquo;t get you to totally believe that nobody likes work, then let&rsquo;s compromise at this: Anybody who loves work is not reading your copy. . They&rsquo;re working. . Okay, now you know copywriters only need to concern themselves with writing to people who want an easy, &ldquo;work-free&rdquo; solution to their problems&hellip; . You can easily grasp the Easy emotion. . Folks want a push-button solution. . Or they want the &ldquo;single, simple trick to 10x their results.&rdquo; There are two reasons for this: . They are lazy | They are insecure | Lazy . The first one is obvious, and probably the first thought that came to your mind immediately. . You can reduce a reader&rsquo;s &ldquo;workload&rdquo; and play into their laziness by making the solution take very little time&hellip; . &ldquo;Six minute abs.&rdquo; . Or by creating a system&hellip; . Or step-by-step solution&hellip; . Or by making it push-button&hellip; . The second reason, they are insecure, goes a little deeper into psychology. . Insecure . You see, like the New emotion, there is a chance that your prospect has tried something similar to what you&rsquo;re offering now&hellip; . And it failed them. . Maybe they blamed the products they bought. . But maybe, at a deeper level, they blamed themselves. . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not smart enough.&rdquo; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich enough.&rdquo; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too ugly, too short, too fat, too bald, too oily, too weak&hellip;&rdquo; . So a writer can multiply the effect of Easy by making things easy enough that Anybody can do it. . And that is where Easy&rsquo;s alter ego comes in. . Easy&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Anybody&rdquo; . When you convey that &ldquo;anybody can do xyz,&rdquo; you are conveying that the process has been dumbed down for the lowest common denominator. . Even though people may think they are bad at something, they never believe that they are the dumbest or worst person on the planet. . So you can quickly and easily convey that something is easy enough for them&hellip; . Despite their insecurities and shortcomings&hellip; . By conveying that it is so fool-proof that Anybody can use this solution and still get incredible results. . This leads us to what are known as &ldquo;Not Statements.&rdquo; . Not Statements . Not statements have two uses. . Build intrigue | Convey Easy/Anybody | The first use of Not Statements is to build intrigue. . Use this when your reader might THINK they know what you&rsquo;re talking about already, but then you say&hellip; . &ldquo;I can easily help you get abs in 6 days with this breakthrough technique&hellip; . It&rsquo;s not muscle confusion. . It&rsquo;s not power lifting. . And it&rsquo;s not cardio&hellip;&rdquo; . You want your reader left thinking, &ldquo;Well shit&hellip; . What is it?!&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s the intrigue side of Not Statements. . The other primary use of Not Statements is to directly employ the Easy / Anybody emotions&hellip; . &ldquo;You can earn $1,000 a week in passive income starting next Monday&hellip; . And you don&rsquo;t have to be a financial genius, or even have finished high school. . You don&rsquo;t have to have any coding or web experience, you could get started in the next five minutes with nothing but an internet connection. . And you don&rsquo;t have to have a lot money&hellip; . all you need is $10!&rdquo; . What not statements do in this context is provide the reader with the certainty that the solution is not too difficult for them. . In other words, the reader doesn&rsquo;t have to do any real work and they are already over-qualified. . Now when you read copywriting, I expect the REAL meaning behind the following words and phrases to POP out at you&hellip; . Easy | Anybody | Simple | 1, 2, 3 | Push-button | Automatic | Fool-proof | Step-by-step | System | All you have to do is&hellip; | All you needed to do&hellip; | Simply follow the steps&hellip; | Not statements | You don&rsquo;t need&hellip; | . Now you know that the copywriter is pushing the Easy/Anybody emotion into action. . &ldquo;This solution will not require work from you&hellip; . And it is not too complicated to be beyond your reach. . You can do this.&rdquo; . Easy. . Here&rsquo;s an example of Easy at play in Money Map&rsquo;s promo for &ldquo;The Money Zone.&rdquo; . Now you&rsquo;re $7,800 richer over a three-week period, all because the S&amp;P 500 went in the direction it was expected to. . And again, all you needed to do was place a middleman trade. . To do this you would have to place a special and very obscure options play on the S&amp;P, which as you know is not a stock but rather the heartbeat of the market itself. . To me this is easy money. . It doesn&rsquo;t get any easier than this. . | . The copywriter directly states that THIS IS EASY. . Below is an example of &ldquo;Not Statements&rdquo; from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . But in just a few minutes you could be one of the lucky few who will get their hands on The Pre-IPO Prospectus&hellip; . Inside this independent research document, you&rsquo;ll learn all the details of this exciting project&hellip; . And see how you can invest in the groundbreaking technology behind it&hellip; . BEFORE this startup goes public. . You don&rsquo;t have to be an accredited investor or have a lot of money. . You don&rsquo;t have to be a stock expert&hellip; . Or even have any investing experience at all. . But you need to act fast&hellip; . I expect by the end of the day all the 945 Pre-IPO Prospectuses I have will be gone. . | . In this copy, I&rsquo;m taking the most common hurdles a reader might bring up immediately and knocking them out line by line. . I&rsquo;m letting them know: &ldquo;Anybody can do this&hellip;&rdquo; . Safe . To capture attention, copywriters are forced to put some pretty bold promises in front of their readers. . Unfortunately, what the copywriters gain in attention with bold promises also comes handcuffed to additional skepticism. . To state the obvious, skepticism makes a copywriter&rsquo;s job more difficult&hellip; . But a smart copywriter can fight that skepticism with the right tools. . But before we get into those&hellip; . A Hidden Benefit of Safe . Employing the Safe emotion will combat reader skepticism&hellip; . And it will also make your offer more appear more VALUABLE to your reader. . Psychology studies have shown that when people consider something &ldquo;risky,&rdquo; they also judge that thing&rsquo;s benefits as less valuable. . Conversely, when folks deem something as &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; they automatically attribute higher value to that thing&rsquo;s benefits. . This might feel counterintuitive to the real world, where higher risk usually comes tied to higher potential rewards, but copywriters are not selling to logical beings&hellip; . They are selling to people. . So knowing what we know about irrational people, the Safe emotion serves two goals: . It makes the reader less skeptical about your offer, thereby making the reader more open to the idea of buying | By reducing risk, Safe automatically increases the reader&rsquo;s perceived value of your offer, because studies have shown that things people perceive as &ldquo;less risky&rdquo; are perceived as &ldquo;more valuable&rdquo; | That makes Safe a very powerful emotion. . And since it has two benefits, it has exponential returns for copywriters! . Risk Aversion . Studies have shown that people are risk averse. . Risk averse basically means people would rather avoid a loss than pursue a gain. . This is sort of common knowledge in the persuasion community. . But what does that mean for us, practically as copywriters? What does that mean for our Big 4 emotions? . The best way to understand it is to view an example from a real psychology study&hellip; . A set of subjects had two choices. . Choice one, they could take &ldquo;a gamble.&rdquo; . The gamble option was an 80% chance to win $100 with a 20% chance to win $10. . To help you visualize what that means&hellip; . Imagine the gamble option as a scratch-off lottery ticket with 10 squares. . Eight squares are worth $100 and two squares are worth $10. . But you can only scratch one square. . Okay, got that visual? . Good. . The other choice people had besides the gamble option was a sure thing of $80, guaranteed. . The results? . Most people take the $80. . Mathematically, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. . A statistician would tell you the value of the gamble was $82. . $100 X .8 + $10 *.2 = $82. . Logically, the gamble is worth more. . But we aren&rsquo;t dealing with logical beings. . We are dealing with people. . And even if you aren&rsquo;t a math whiz, turning down an 80% chance at $100 is a tough option to turn down. . Especially when the lowest possible outcome was to still win $10&hellip; . UNLESS you are a human being who places incredible value on CERTAINTY. . Fact is, most people in this experiment would rather &ldquo;pay a premium&rdquo; or &ldquo;take a discounted payout&rdquo; in exchange for CERTAINTY. . Even though an 80% chance at $100 is pretty damn good odds. . People would rather sacrifice 20 potential dollars and take a guaranteed $80. . Just because it&rsquo;s Safe. . Even though the worst-case scenario came in at a minority 20% chance&hellip; . Folks totally threw out the logical, and more attractive offer of an 80% shot at a better payout of $100. . What does this mean for you, as a copywriter? . It means your reader is very much invested in eliminating as much risk as possible. . Remember when we said the Safe emotion increases PERCEIVED value of your offer? Here&rsquo;s your proof&hellip; . Given two valuable options, people would prefer the LESS VALUABLE option ($80 instead of $100)&hellip; . As long as it is LESS RISKY (100% vs 80% chance). . They perceive the more Safe option as more desirable, even though it is in fact, less valuable. . Just to feel that sense of Safe. . Safe&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . There&rsquo;s a powerful way to jack up the level of Safe a reader feels. . If a copywriter can convey that something follows a Predictable pattern&hellip; . That the opportunity follows in-step with something similar that has happened before&hellip; . Or that this opportunity or its benefits are &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; then readers will perceive that thing as even more &ldquo;Safe.&rdquo; . Showing patterns inside credibility, track record, testimonials, case studies, success stories, etc., demonstrates that &ldquo;xyz result&rdquo; is more &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . The subtext conveyed is that the last time something like &ldquo;A&rdquo; happened in history, &ldquo;B&rdquo; was the result. . Made Up Example: . &ldquo;In 2005, Company A&rsquo;s stock dropped 800 points and then Company A hired CEO Frank. . Then investors in Company A made 10 million dollars in 48 hours. . Today, Company B&rsquo;s stock has just dropped 800 points and guess who they hired as CEO&hellip;? That&rsquo;s right, CEO Frank. . You already know what&rsquo;s bound to happen next for Company B&rsquo;s investors in just a matter of time. . | . If you can set up the pattern to be obvious&hellip; . And then let the READER predict or infer what will happen next like in the made up example above&hellip; . Then the reader is actually SELLING THEMSELVES on the opportunity. . So that was just one made up example. . I&rsquo;ll once again remind you that the words you choose are not as important as the subtext they convey. . That&rsquo;s why this guide does not say, &ldquo;write copy this way.&rdquo; . You write whatever words help you convey Safe and Predictable. . And now that you understand the emotion of Safe and its alter ego Predictable&hellip; . You can automatically translate the following words and phrases when you see them for what they really mean: &ldquo;This is Safe, therefore it is exceptionally beneficial and valuable.&rdquo; . Happened before | Predictable | Safe | History is repeating itself | Just like we&rsquo;ve seen before | Again | The last time this happened&hellip; | . We can see an example of Safe using the SAME copywriting example we used for Easy. . Here&rsquo;s that clip again from The Money Zone&hellip; . Now you&rsquo;re $7,800 richer over a three-week period, all because the S&amp;P 500 went in the direction it was expected to. . And again, all you needed to do was place a middleman trade. . To do this you would have to place a special and very obscure options play on the S&amp;P, which as you know is not a stock but rather the heartbeat of the market itself. . To me this is easy money. . It doesn&#3387;t get any easier than this. . Is there risk? Sure, whenever you&rsquo;re dealing with the markets&hellip; . You can always lose. . As I told you just minutes ago&hellip; . The master algorithm knows &ndash; with 93% certainty &ndash; which direction the S&amp;P is going in (one week in advance)&hellip; . But if the S&amp;P doesn&rsquo;t go in that direction over the following week, it won&rsquo;t enter the Money Zone, and you won&rsquo;t get paid. . | . Notice the copywriter actually gave the level of Safe a numerical value&hellip; 93% certainty. . How Predictable is this benefit? 93%. . This is a great time to explain why the writer would not WANT to claim 100% certainty&hellip; . A 100% claim in the stock market is simply unbelievable. . The entire world would be turned upside down if one person could figure out how to never miss a single opportunity in the stock market. . Everybody in the world would be breaking down doors to get that solution and its value would clearly be infinity dollars, since you could never lose money. . Therefore, a 100% certainty claim would actually create more skepticism, not less. . It&rsquo;s up to you to draw that line in your copy, depending on your niche and product offering. . I will mention I have seen a &ldquo;type&rdquo; of 100% claim in financial copywriting before. . In Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heatseekers&rdquo; promo&hellip; . The headline read: . . Using the track record in this way infers Safe and Predictable without guaranteeing it. . Big . Big generally refers to the size of the opportunity at hand. . This emotion communicates that the opportunity in front of the reader is extremely important, groundbreaking, and rewarding. . Big is probably the most abstract emotion of the four. . It can take many forms &ndash; but it can also be directly stated in copy. . Also, the other three emotions can directly feed into Big... . If something is New, it could be disruptive. . A disruption is usually Big. . &ldquo;The last time something like this happened, it was extremely disruptive&hellip;&rdquo; . That also weaves Predictability in the mix, since we infer we have seen something similar when we say &ldquo;the last time.&rdquo; . (That&rsquo;s pretty cool, huh? Soon you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up on these patterns as you binge copywriting). . A writer can weave Easy into Big by saying something like: . “This is so easy you’ll never trade stocks the same way again.” . So you see, the emotions can work in harmony. . Big is important, because it demands attention. . It infers change, and that is usually why someone reads your copy&hellip; . Because they want a change. . And Big works especially well when coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO). . Fear of Missing Out . Big lends itself easily to FOMO. . For example&hellip; . &ldquo;Do you want to miss out on the chance to invest in the next Google/Amazon/Facebook? Because that&rsquo;s how much money is at stake&hellip;&rdquo; . The reader might feel: &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty big. . I should pay attention.&rdquo; . Big&rsquo;s Alter Ego is &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; . It is important that the reader feel like they are standing at the foot of a mountain of opportunity. . This single thing can improve your life 10,000%.&rdquo; . The only thing better than something that big&hellip; . &ldquo;This single thing can improve your life 10,000% overnight&hellip;&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s great to see your money grow 10,000%... . To see your strength improve 10,000%... . To see your skin look 10,000% silkier and younge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . But what&rsquo;s better than those Big changes? . All &nbsp;of that stuff in a matter of seconds, minutes, days&hellip; . Not years. . So Fast multiplies the Big of your offer. . Knowing this, you can automatically translate the following phrases&hellip; . Big | Fast | Monster | Huge | Once in a lifetime | Quickly | Overnight | Weekly | . You&rsquo;ll know that Big commands attention&hellip; . It triggers FOMO&hellip; . And the only thing better than Big is getting something Big NOW. . Big AND Fast. . Here&rsquo;s an example of some real copywriting that demonstrates Big and Fast from The Hottest IPO promo&hellip; . And when it comes to growth, nobody comes even close to this startup&hellip; . That&rsquo;s why tech magazine Inc. . says: . &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quite Possibly the Fastest-Growing Private Company Ever&rdquo; . Business Insider calls it &ldquo;the most valuable startup in the U.S. . and across the globe.&rdquo; . And Time magazine called it &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing startup&rdquo; and &ldquo;the defining technology success story of this era.&rdquo; . It&rsquo;s growing faster than Google&hellip; . It&rsquo;s growing three times FASTER than Facebook. . It&rsquo;s growing even faster than Amazon. . And we know these companies all made a lot of people overnight millionaires. . In fact &mdash; Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon himself, says if you had invested in Amazon before it went public, you would have made 70,000 times your money! . Meaning a measly $1,000 investment could have turned into $70 million. . But you HAD to get in position before the IPO. . Because look at Amazon now. . It trades at over $1,000 per share! . In order to just make two times your money, that sucker would have to go up ONE THOUSAND dollars more! . That could take around, oh let&rsquo;s see&hellip; . an entire century. . But if you had been among the lucky few investors who moved fast, before Amazon went public&hellip; . You&rsquo;d be set for life. . Taking orders from nobody. . Enjoying the perks of what some people would call &ldquo;F-U money&rdquo;. . Like I said, the private company I&rsquo;m sharing with you today is growing even faster than Amazon. . It has poured billions into some accredited investors&rsquo; accounts already. . That&rsquo;s why&hellip; . You Need to Act Fast&hellip; . Because Silicon Valley Insiders Are Getting Rich With Each Passing Day . | . Notice how all the elements come together in this passage... . It&rsquo;s BIG, worth millions. . It&rsquo;s growing FASTER than the Biggest companies. . And OTHER PEOPLE are already getting rich (FOMO). . I&rsquo;ll give you one more example of Big and Fast&hellip; . This one from that same Money Map promo I used earlier about the new liquid. . Except this time, specifically pay attention to the &ldquo;Bigness.&rdquo; . Dear Reader, . Hello, I&#39;m Dr. Kent Moors. . I&#39;m reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history... . And the last time was more than a century ago. . The key to this opportunity is a world-changing new liquid that&#39;s being pumped into a procession of unmarked tanker trucks right now... . Even as you read this, these trucks are rolling out of a small American company&#39;s nondescript &ndash; yet highly secure &ndash; production facility in the Midwest. . Why all the secrecy and security? . I&#39;ll explain that fully in just a moment. . But the crux of it is that this tiny company has pioneered an incredible new &quot;polymorphic&quot; substance... . And that substance is about to transform dozens of global industries worth at least $3.1 trillion per year. . In the history of human commerce, this is by far the biggest combined market ever targeted by a single company... . | . This excerpt is dripping with Big&hellip; . &ldquo;HUGE profit opportunity.&rdquo; . &nbsp;&ldquo;Only seen twice in history.&rdquo; . &ldquo;World-changing&rdquo; . &ldquo;By far the biggest.&rdquo; . And &ldquo;Even as you read this,&rdquo; indicates that it&rsquo;s happening NOW, without your knowledge&hellip; . &nbsp;Tickling the FOMO trigger. . I LOVE this excerpt because you can find a strong presence of New, Safe, and Big in these few short sentences. . Because this promo is not offering a &ldquo;system&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; for the reader to follow, it doesn&rsquo;t lean too much on the Easy emotion. . And that&rsquo;s okay. . Every line of copy doesn&rsquo;t have to have all four emotions. . You&rsquo;ll start to recognize that as you begin binging copy on your own. . And remember, if you want the full promo for any of the excerpts I&rsquo;ve shown, you can have them totally free at: www.kylethewriter.com/swipe . Summing Up The Big 4 Emotions&hellip; . Now that you understand that an entire body of copy is driven by four main emotions and their alter egos&hellip; . I think you are ready to dive into the nuances of the different sections of copy. . There are also four of them, too. . But no cool name this time (maybe there will be when I write the second edition of this book). . The Four Sections of Copy . All words in a piece of copy are not created equal. . Remember that the Big 4 should be weaved into virtually every line of copy&hellip; . And aside from those emotions, specific words have specific roles to play, depending on what section of the copy they are in. . There is an order to a sales letter, and that is important. . Abandon the order, and the copy doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense. . So think of it like this&hellip; . In English we say: &ldquo;The red apple.&rdquo; . In Spanish it&rsquo;s reversed; &ldquo;La manzana roja.&rdquo; Translated literally: &ldquo;The apple red.&rdquo; . If you screw around with the order, the meaning isn&rsquo;t totally lost&hellip; . But it sure is mangled. . And that is bad for keeping the attention of busy and skeptical readers. . So to simplify everything, let&rsquo;s break the copy into four sections&hellip; . And we will have specific things to look for in each section while we are actively reading&hellip; . The four sections of copy are: . The headline | The lead | The body | The offer | Before we dive in, remember the goal of this guide&hellip; . This guide is meant to decode the language of copywriting. . It will be the tool that allows you to decipher the subtext in each section of copy. . You just need to know what to look for&hellip; . So in this upcoming section you&rsquo;ll get a brand new method to help you perform active reading. . As you learn the framework for copywriting in this next section&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll also learn to TRANSLATE the subliminal messages of the copywriting language into &ldquo;plain English.&rdquo; It will seem like I&rsquo;m telling you WHAT to write, but that is not our goal with this. . I&rsquo;m teaching you how to TRANSLATE what you are reading&hellip; . Then you will be able to accomplish the greater goal of &ldquo;binging&rdquo; good copywriting&hellip; . You want to learn how to effectively BINGE. . That should be your main focus. . Because if you can binge on good copywriting&hellip; . You can recognize the obvious patterns. . Like when I binged too much of &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; and ruined the show for myself. . After that, you&rsquo;ll know everything you need to write your own amazing copy with ease. . Section 1: The Headline . A crazy amount of the information must be conveyed very early in the copy. . Unfortunately, most readers won&rsquo;t read much further than the headline&hellip; . So you&rsquo;ve got to cram a lot of stuff into your copy right away. . You&rsquo;ve probably heard this before, but if you haven&rsquo;t: . &ldquo;The purpose of a headline is to grab attention.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a VERY simplistic way to put it and there is A LOT to unpack from that line. . In fact, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; way to put it, and this section will uncover the underlying assumptions that often go undiscussed. . First, we should discuss the structure of a headline. . The Structure of the Headline Complex . Here&rsquo;s the headline for The Hottest IPO In History . . The line at the top: “WARNING: Limited Spots Available” is referred to as the “eyebrow.” . The headline is &ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History.&rdquo; . The stuff below the headline, the &ldquo;99.9%...goes public!&rdquo; is referred to as &ldquo;deck copy.&rdquo; . You could call the testimonial beneath &ldquo;deck copy.&rdquo; . You could call it &ldquo;the testimonial box.&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s where my structure expertise ends because it doesn&rsquo;t much matter what you label it. . The 4 U&rsquo;s . The quickest method for translating a headline is to identify four elements commonly labeled as &ldquo;The Four U&rsquo;s.&rdquo; (lots of fours in this guide, huh?) . A google search told me that the 4 U&rsquo;s were originally developed by legendary entrepreneur and copywriter, Mark Ford. . Ford co-founded American Writers and Artists, Inc&hellip; . And The Palm Beach Letter, the flagship investment advisory for Palm Beach Research Group. . I haven&rsquo;t done any further research on how the 4 U&rsquo;s were developed or what they specifically meant to Mark Ford. . That being said: Ford may have slightly different definitions than I&rsquo;m sharing here, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be material differences. . So in this section, I&rsquo;m going to be explaining what the four U&rsquo;s mean to me, personally. . The four U&rsquo;s are: . Urgent | Unique | Useful | Ultra-Specific | . All four do not have to be present for a headline to work. . But if 2 or more are missing, the headline will probably not hold attention. . Urgent . Urgency is easy. . Just convey that there is a limited time to read this piece of copy and get in on this opportunity. . When you see a date in the headline, its sole purpose is to convey urgency. . “Take action by December 21” . “Sale ends this Friday” . Usually, when one conveys the Big emotion in the headline, it also creates urgency through FOMO. . FOMO is like a cousin of urgency. . Consider the Hottest IPO headline again: . &ldquo;The Hottest IPO in History&rdquo; . . There is nothing specifically urgent about it&hellip; but there is a hint of urgency within the FOMO it generates. . The &ldquo;deck copy&rdquo; beneath the headline teases more urgency with the &ldquo;BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s another subtle example from Money Map: . . Notice how the copywriter says it&rsquo;s ABOUT to go public. . Also you&rsquo;ll see the Big emotion and FOMO clearly at play here. . Many times, copywriters just go right for the throat with urgency. . Here&rsquo;s an example from a headline with clear urgency&hellip; . I wrote this during the cryptocurrency boom: . . Urgency is the simplest U, and one of the U&rsquo;s that could be discarded from the headline, so long as the other 3 are present. . One of my favorite promos was Money Map&rsquo;s &ldquo;Money Zone&rdquo; promo. . That was a very successful promo, and there was zero urgency in the headline. . Take a look&hellip; . . Ultra-Specific . The next U is Ultra-specific. . Find some way to make the opportunity &ldquo;weirdly&rdquo; specific. . Don&rsquo;t tell someone they can make $10,000. . Tell them they can make $10,251 (odd numbers supposedly work best). . Don&rsquo;t tell them they&rsquo;ll look 10 years younger&hellip; . Tell them they&rsquo;ll look 12 and a half years younger. . Starting to get it? . Don&rsquo;t tell them their strength will improve 100%... . Tell them it will improve 251%. . Alright. . So that&rsquo;s one way. . Another way to plug in some ultra-specificity is with speed. . Selling a karate course? . &ldquo;A 3-second karate move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo; . The specific numbers imply that the headline&rsquo;s claim has been tested and proven before. . The line: &ldquo;A 3-second move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!&rdquo; implies that this move has in fact worked in 3 seconds before&hellip; . AND the move worked for someone who weighed 134 pounds less than their opponent. . The reason ultra-specificity is so important is it plants depth into the claim. . In short, it makes the headline seem REAL. . It increases believability. . At least enough that the reader may investigate further. . In The Hottest IPO example above, the promise was &ldquo;can turn the average retirement into $588,000 or more&hellip; . BEFORE this company goes public!&rdquo; . In the 70-Cent Crypto example above: &ldquo;turn a small sum into $2.7 million.&rdquo; . Go as specific as legally possible, and don&rsquo;t lie. . Generally, the ultra-specific claim should be based on an example that you will demonstrate in your lead or body copy. . Consider the lead copy of 70 Cent Crypto: . . See how right away we explain where the $2.7 million claim came from? . Ultra-specific is another one of the U&rsquo;s that can be discarded, so long as the other 3 U&rsquo;s are still present. . Money Map&rsquo;s Money Zone promo claimed you could make &ldquo;up to $11,000 a week&rdquo; and it worked very well. . I would say that line is sorta specific. . Not &ldquo;ultra.&rdquo; . And that promo&rsquo;s headline didn&rsquo;t even have ANY urgency! . Unique . Unique is non-negotiable. . Because unique is a synonym for New and novel. . We know from The Big 4 Emotions that New is the foundation of strong copy. . If your headline offers up something the reader has seen before, they will not waste their precious time reading it. . Think about the health niche, where diets come and go. . Is anybody still trying to sell you on the Atkins diet? . A while back it was EVERYWHERE. . But after a while it wasn&rsquo;t New. . And it wasn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;magic bullet solution&rdquo; many people thought it would be. . And thus, they began their search for the next &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; that would make them a healthier, fitter, sexier person&hellip; . overnight. . The South Beach Diet was first called the &ldquo;Modified Carbohydrate Diet.&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t a sexy sell&hellip; . After rebranding the diet as something New (The South Beach Diet), it took off. . In 2018, the ketogenic diet (keto) was the hot new diet. . And I bet in 2019 keto will all but disappear, except for within the circles of intense keto advocates. . New diets will continue to emerge and dominate simply because the market demands it. . People who struggle to consistently diet and exercise will always be looking for the easier solution. . That&rsquo;s one of the things that makes &ldquo;unique&rdquo; so captivating. . Take a look at this Money Map headline for their Night Trader Product&hellip; . The copywriter infers &ldquo;this is different&rdquo; by starting with &ldquo;99.99% of American Investors Trade During the Day&hellip;&rdquo; . And then moving into&hellip; . &ldquo;While other people toss and turn&hellip;&rdquo; . This conveys the subtext that he is doing something New&hellip; . He&rsquo;s the Only person doing it (or at least in the 00.01%)&hellip; . And that makes it Unique! . If the reader has been struggling for success in the stock market, this headline offers up some secret knowledge about a New, unique method that they&rsquo;ve never heard of&hellip; . This headline offers hope because it is unique! . Another example of unique&rsquo;s power can be found by referring back to the Money Zone headline from the previous section&hellip; . I would argue that the uniqueness of the Money Zone headline&hellip; . Where they claim America&rsquo;s #1 stock analyst is &ldquo;DONE with stocks!&rdquo;... . Is where the power of the headline came from. . How often does the #1 person at anything announce they are completely giving that thing up? Something New and better must have been uncovered! . The copywriter understood that nothing is more important than being New and Novel&hellip; . When you plant something unique in your headline, you are conveying the New emotion in the subtext. . To convey something unique, just pull one item from your product or offer, and emphasize it. . The Money Zone product doesn&rsquo;t trade traditional stocks. . The Night Trader product trades at night. . It&rsquo;s not rocket science. . Your product probably has more than one unique element to it. . For instance, here is a second headline for The Hottest IPO that I wrote&hellip; . . This headline is selling the same product as The Hottest IPO, but with a completely fresh and unique idea. . The main selling point of The Hottest IPO and The $15 Trillion Gadget is that self-driving cars are going to be very disruptive. . So I was able to tie that idea of self-driving cars to an IPO and also tie it to the physical parts that make self-driving cars work. . This is useful for refreshing fatiguing copy, but that&rsquo;s a little advanced for this section. . The point is&hellip; . finding something unique in your offer or product just requires a little critical thinking. . Just Highlight Something . Don&rsquo;t spin your wheels trying to make your idea totally &ldquo;revolutionary.&rdquo; . Finding something unique isn&rsquo;t that hard. . In fact, that is probably the hardest part&hellip; . There is no &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; for you. . It probably won&rsquo;t &ldquo;jump out at you.&rdquo; . Because your unique element could be any insignificant thing. . There just needs to be a unique element in your headline that the reader has never, ever seen before. . An easy &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to think about this: &ldquo;The first BLANK to ever&hellip;&rdquo; . &ldquo;The first skin cream to ever use volcanic ash.&rdquo; . &ldquo;The first options trading system to ever exclusively trade 25 cent options&hellip;&rdquo; This conveys New, and New conveys unique. . I want to push you away from copying down this line and using it. . Because I don&rsquo;t necessarily want you to directly state this line in your headline. . In fact, I almost deleted this &ldquo;hack&rdquo; example from this guide&hellip; . For fear you would simply use it as a bland template. . This &ldquo;hack&rdquo; is supposed to get your mind thinking about the subtext you need to convey: NEW. . Remember, I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write&hellip; . I&rsquo;m offering tools to help you translate the copywriting language so YOU can speak it fluently. . Let&rsquo;s look over a quick example to show what I mean&hellip; . The 70 Cent Crypto headline is a great example. . . When we wrote this promo, cryptocurrencies were hot. . Everybody was piling into crypto. . So how could I make headline about cryptocurrencies feel unique? I could just pick one element about the crypto and highlight it. . All I had to do was draw attention to how cheap the crypto was and voila. . I wouldn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;The first crypto ever to be 70 cents and could make you rich.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why templates are bad news. . Once you can speak the copywriting language, your headline will use words that are as natural to you as how you describe your favorite restaurant. . Think about this&hellip; . If you wanted to convince me to go to your favorite restaurant, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t say: . &ldquo;How do I get Kyle interested in this restaurant? Ummm&hellip; It&rsquo;s the first restaurant ever to&hellip; Uhhh&hellip; the first restaurant ever to give me two loaves of bread before dinner?&rdquo; . If you try to fit your writing into a tight template, it will stifle your abilities... . It will kill your ability to create something New... . And that will kill your success. . We are not putting together a piece of furniture when we build a headline&hellip; . We are speaking a language of subtext and emotion. . Always, always, always, start your process THERE. . Think to yourself &ldquo;I know the subtext I must communicate, what words might do that best?&rdquo; And make sure your headline has some unique element or idea in it. . Useful . The reader will not care to read your copy if they do not feel they will draw something useful from it. . This means you will already need to know what your audience finds &ldquo;useful...&rdquo; . This will require some research. . To write something truly useful, you&rsquo;ll want to know: . Who your ideal prospect is | What topics they are curious about today | What promises or benefits would compel them to continue reading on | . One approach is to directly offer a benefit: . &ldquo;Make money&rdquo; . &ldquo;Look younger&rdquo; . Etc&hellip; . Or you can offer information on a specific topic that is top of mind, that they are interested in&hellip; . Take a look at this headline by Palm Beach Research Group for their product, The Palm Beach Letter. . . This headline refers to President Trump&rsquo;s tax reform, which was highly covered by the media. . You can see the copywriter took something top of mind and made it useful. . When you know what is top of mind for your reader, you can write something that strikes a specific chord of intrigue. . Intrigue Alone is NOT Useful &ndash; What&rsquo;s In It For Me? (WIIFM) . I have seen experienced copywriters make this mistake before... . They&rsquo;ll show me a headline and say, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; . I search and search but then I&rsquo;m forced to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; . And then they&rsquo;ll say something like, &ldquo;Well, this is a topic they should really be interested in reading more about...&rdquo; . Then they frown and realize that intrigue alone is not going to cut it. . Sometimes even great writers can get caught up in the excitement of their idea. . But great copywriters also know that intrigue alone is not enough to pull a reader into your sales letter. . Once this error is pointed out to them, experienced copywriters immediately go back to the drawing board without argument. . Remember, everyone wants to know &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In It For Me?&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;WIIFM is everyone&rsquo;s favorite radio station.&rdquo; . Your headline must be useful to the reader. . Going back to the Palm Beach Letter headline: &ldquo;We Snuck Through!&rdquo; . That is a cool, intriguing headline&hellip; . Snuck through where??? . The writer teases the usefulness via &ldquo;income tricks&rdquo; while introducing a topic that is top of mind: tax reform. . &ldquo;18 Little&mdash;Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo; . And finally, really making it REALLY useful for the reader, the writer drops the line: . &ldquo;A new FREE BOOK reveals how you could collect up to $6,842 per month thanks to these 100% legal ideas&hellip;&rdquo; . And if you&rsquo;re really paying attention, you should be able to see how we are incorporating different elements we&rsquo;ve learned in the previous sections. . It All Adds Up . Let&rsquo;s take a moment to go through this&hellip; . The words &ldquo;little known&rdquo; and &ldquo;loopholes&rdquo; imply you can &ldquo;Only&rdquo; get this knowledge from me. . Otherwise everyone would know. . Only is New&rsquo;s powerful alter ego. . The link to Trump&rsquo;s tax reforms makes the headline Safe... . By tying the headline to the government and the law, the opportunity has the highest level of credibility. . Making $6,842 per month is ultra-specific, useful, &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable.&rdquo; . Predictable because per month implies the income will repeat on a monthly basis. . A FREE BOOK is cheap enough for Anyone to Easily afford. . And &ldquo;100% legal ideas&rdquo; implies that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything out of the ordinary, shady, or difficult. . See how many boxes have been checked... . All of it neatly wrapped into the headline. . Wrapping Up The Headline . Perhaps without this guide, you might have seen a headline like, &ldquo;&ldquo;WE SNUCK THROUGH!&rdquo; 18 Little&mdash; Known Tax Loopholes and Income Tricks that Made it Through Tax Reform Intact!&rdquo; . And thought: &ldquo;benefit driven headline.&rdquo; But now, in this guide&hellip; . Right in front of you&hellip; . You have all the tools you need to pick apart headlines like this and see what they really communicate. . The copywriting language is a direct link to a reader&rsquo;s emotional triggers. . The language is communicated purely through the subtext. . All you have to do is keep your focus on The Big 4. . Already you&rsquo;ve seen how a copywriter can communicate New, Easy, Safe and Big in a wild variety of ways. . You&rsquo;ve seen that the words do not matter&hellip; . Only what the words imply. . That&rsquo;s why I try very hard to never tell you what to write&hellip; . Because I want YOU to develop the your copywriting fluency to a point that you intuitively know you communicate something is Easy simply by calling it &ldquo;100% legal.&rdquo; . Going forward, you&rsquo;ll know with a quick glance whether a headline is doing its job well or not. . And you&rsquo;ll be able to binge hundreds of headlines this way&hellip; . Uncovering the subliminal patterns that make the best ones work so well. . Now that you know what elements must be communicated, via the language of copywriting, you can quickly form your own headlines. . And I didn&rsquo;t tell you a single thing to write&hellip; . Because it isn&rsquo;t what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . When you know you must communicate urgency&hellip; the words will just come naturally. . And it will be more and more natural as you binge more and more copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll recognize the common patterns of how other writers convey urgency. . It will be the same when you know you must communicate uniqueness: the words will come naturally. . You know you must communicate ultra-specificity&hellip; . The words will come naturally. . You know you must communicate usefulness&hellip; and guess what? . The words will come as naturally as saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful day outside&rdquo; in plain English. . And very soon, as you make your way through the rest of this guide&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll be able to go from headline to P.S. writing your own piece of copy&hellip; . Powerfully communicating in the language of copywriting with ease. . You&rsquo;ll see that virtually every line in a successful piece of copy serves a purpose. . And once you know how to translate the subtext from the words&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . For the first time ever, you&rsquo;ll speak the same language as the best copywriters in the world. . You&rsquo;ll be unstoppable. . Section 2: The Lead . The lead is what immediately follows the headline and in terms of the Big 4, the lead is the generally the densest area of a piece of copy. . It would not be crazy to think you could spend 30 minutes picking apart the first 500 words of a piece of copy. . I have a few ways to sum up a lead. . A Lead Is Like The Abstract To A Scholarly Journal Article. . If you&rsquo;ve ever looked up a scholarly journal article, they always have an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; at the top. . Or you might see it on the preview page where they ask you to pay for the full article. . In an abstract, the researcher has to communicate pretty much all the major details of the study. . That could be the major details about the sample, the methods, and the results. . And that serves as a high-level summary of the what you can expect if you purchase the research article&hellip; . If a reader wants the finer details, they buy or read the whole article. . That&rsquo;s basically what a copywriter is tasked to do when writing a lead. . Here are the FIVE major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead: . Capture attention (Can be done in headline) | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a big promise | Open a loop (bribe) | . But before we get into the step-by-steps, we have to cover some ground rules. . A Lead Should Contain The Most Compelling Claims and Info That Will Be Covered In The Copy . A copywriter has to cram some of the &ldquo;major&rdquo; information about what will be covered in the body copy into the first couple pages&hellip; . Or approximately 500-ish words. . Keep in mind, leads can vary in length. . In long form sales letters, I&rsquo;ve seen leads range anywhere from 2-7 pages. . Basically, you&rsquo;ll want to tease your most compelling claim or claims and produce your general sales message in the lead. . And you haven&rsquo;t started proving your claims by page 7, you probably need to scale the lead back. . At a minimum: . The Lead Should Introduce the Fundamental Claim or Idea That Will Be Covered or Proven in the Body Copy. . That does NOT mean you must reveal the offer or product in the lead. . Not even a little bit. . In many sales letters, the offer or product is hidden until the very last few pages. . Usually in a long form sales letter, the lead&rsquo;s purpose is to build hype about an opportunity&hellip; . Or really illustrate the terrible problem that needs to be solved. . It does that by acutely focusing on the Big 4, right up until the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; is introduced. . Often, once the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; behind the letter (the guy selling something) is introduced, the lead is over. . And essentially, by the time you reach the end of the lead, all the major information that would make your prospect want to buy should have already been conveyed. . The rest of the letter, called the body copy, is just &ldquo;proving the point.&rdquo; . A Lead Offers ONE Big Idea or Promise Which Can Be Summed Up In A Single Sentence . In my experience, writing a lead is an &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; process. . That is, I won&rsquo;t actually know everything that will be in the lead until the promo is about fully written. . Sometimes when I&rsquo;m writing the body copy I&rsquo;ll discover some neat hook, a weird angle, or a new piece of information I could go back and inject into the lead. . It&rsquo;s been the same while writing this guide. . I started writing this guide knowing the &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; I wanted to take the text. . I had ONE idea. . Which I could sum up in a single sentence&hellip; . &ldquo;Copywriting is a language, communicated purely through subtext.&rdquo; . I started my introduction by writing some of the things I THOUGHT I would cover&hellip; . But as I&rsquo;ve been writing the book, it has taken a life and direction of its own. . And I keep having to go back and change my introduction to tease what is really be covered. . It&rsquo;s the same thing with any lead, in my experience. . But you should still only have one idea. . The Headline, Lead, and Body Copy Share a &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . Before you write a word of copy, summarize your idea in one sentence. . This is the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of your letter. . It is the lifeforce that compelled you to write your piece of copy in the first place. . The reason for this is you NEED a single coherent direction. . Start with this question: what is the one major benefit or payoff that everything in your copy will tie to? I&rsquo;ve heard this called &ldquo;The Golden Thread.&rdquo; . And it&rsquo;s also been referred to as &ldquo;The Rule of One.&rdquo; I call it the &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . Ideally, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what the Soul of your copy is before you start writing. . But as I mentioned earlier, for me writing the lead is an &ldquo;ongoing process.&rdquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I like the term &ldquo;Soul.&rdquo; . It gives your idea permission to exist like a living thing&hellip; . Something that grows and evolves over time. . Sometimes your Soul will be crystal clear&hellip; . Sometimes you will have to hash out a couple attempts to focus or find your Soul. . But you should always have some sense for what your Soul is about. . New information should just sharpen the Soul and make it clearer. . The point is, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if your Soul starts a little vague when you write the first version of your lead. . But at the end of writing your copy, EVERYTHING should be tied to ONE idea that you can sum up in a single sentence. . For example, I wrote a promo called Trump Bonus Checks with another copywriter, Rob Braddock. . We had ONE sentence to guide all of our writing. . That sentence was EXACTLY THIS: . &ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo; . . That was the Soul of our promo. . If anything we wrote deviated from that message in any way, it was promptly deleted. . Okay, knowing all these things I&rsquo;ve explained about the lead&hellip; . Again, here are the FOUR major things you&rsquo;ll want to accomplish in a lead: . Capture attention | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a Big Promise | Open a loop | . The Lead Should Capture Attention . To capture attention, some copywriters begin their lead with what is called a pattern interrupt. . &nbsp;A super easy way to quickly capture a reader&rsquo;s attention is to just show them something&hellip; . Preferably something they haven&rsquo;t seen before in another ad. . Here&rsquo;s a couple examples from promos I have worked on. . Notice how all the lead text starts in a similar fashion&hellip; . . . . . Coming up with a pattern interrupt isn&rsquo;t rocket science. . Just try to get the reader to focus attention on you. . Be aware of what your competitors are putting in front of your reader as pattern interrupts. . You do not want to present your reader with something they have seen before. . Now you know you can grab their attention in the lead with a pattern interrupt&hellip; . Or, if you think your headline complex by itself was a strong enough pattern interrupt, you can build their intrigue by expanding upon your headline. . The Lead Should Expand Upon the Headline . You&rsquo;ll want the lead to flow right out of your headline and offer some additional relevant information about your headline. . This is sometimes called a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo; . Payoffs . Your headline should generate sufficient curiosity for the reader to want to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about. . The next line out of the headline should give them just a little bit more detail without giving away anything too particular. . Some folks refer to this as a &ldquo;payoff.&rdquo; . I can demonstrate the payoff concept in the first couple lines of a successful marketing email I wrote for The $15 Trillion Gadget. . Tiny, Incredible Gadget Could Bring $15 Trillion&hellip; . Dear Reader, . A gadget you could conceal in the palm of your hand&hellip; . That could easily pass through airport security&hellip; . And could be mass-produced quickly&hellip; . Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a breakthrough $15 trillion tech revolution&hellip; . Of course this will make a lot of investors very rich&hellip; . But it will also scare lot of people. . Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, &ldquo;Once the massive market disruption begins&hellip; &nbsp;we expect significant turmoil.&rdquo; . The boom is coming either way. . It&rsquo;s your choice whether you want to grow wealthy&hellip; &nbsp;or just be scared. . Click here now to learn about what&rsquo;s coming. . | . The sales letter I wrote this email for has nothing to do with airport security&hellip; . Or much to do with the gadget or its mass production abilities. . If you&rsquo;ll recall from earlier, this sales letter was about self-driving cars. . So we have our headline (or subject line, for this email): . &ldquo;Tiny, Incredible Gadget Could Bring $15 Trillion&hellip;&rdquo; . Then the first couple lines of this email are little nothing &ldquo;payoffs&rdquo; I give the reader to expand on the headline&hellip; . They don&rsquo;t really offer any new useful information&hellip; . They are just something I use to capture and hold the reader&rsquo;s attention while I shift gears to the real opportunity I want to talk about&hellip; . The technology inside the gadget, and its potential money rewards. . That&rsquo;s when I drop the line: . &ldquo;Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a breakthrough $15 trillion tech revolution&hellip;&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s the big promise I really want them to read. . It was the same strategy with the pattern interrupt examples above. . I captured the reader&rsquo;s attention just long enough to shift to my big promise&hellip; . Which is usually something like: &ldquo;You can get rich from this.&rdquo; . You want to get to your one big promise as soon as possible. . As. Soon. As. &nbsp;Possible. . Here&rsquo;s another example of expanding upon the headline in promo I wrote for Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass&hellip; . . Throughout this entire excerpt of copy, I&rsquo;m simply expanding upon the &ldquo;49 Retirement Income Tricks&rdquo; I mentioned in the headline. . Okay let&rsquo;s recap what we have so far&hellip; . Recap for the first two: . Get their attention with the headline and the 4 U&rsquo;s&hellip; . Pattern interrupts are a powerful and easy way to capture attention. . Expand on your headline&hellip; . And remember, when you expand upon the headline, you do not have to give away your secrets. . You can just list properties about the subject that your headline focused on. . The goal is to build curiosity, intrigue, and/or hype. . Then, offer your ONE big promise as soon as possible. . P.S. &nbsp;As extra practice, you can start to look for the Big 4 in all the examples above. . | . The Lead Should Offer Credibility . Very early in your lead, the copy should offer credibility that explains why your reader should believe you. . Thinking about it logically &ndash; You should have made a big promise in your headline&hellip; . Your promise is weird and specific enough to capture and hold attention&hellip; . It offers something the reader wants&hellip; . And chances are, the reader is so cynical and skeptical they are on the edge of shouting &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; the first chance they get. . In fact, they can&rsquo;t wait to call bullshit on a &ldquo;scammy marketer&rdquo; like you. . They live for it! . This is the time to inject some cred that proves either: . You are a credible authority, who should be listened to, or&hellip; | Your claims are supported by credible authorities | You do not need to make a big show of credibility in the lead. . Just a single line will do for now. . Because as you&rsquo;ll see when we explore the body copy, there is a more appropriate time to lay the credibility on thick. . If we refer back to that short email I wrote, you&rsquo;ll see I inject some credibility after my big promise by quoting an authority: . &ldquo;Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, &ldquo;Once the massive market disruption begins&hellip; we expect significant turmoil.&rdquo; &ldquo; . We don&rsquo;t know how or why the turmoil will come&hellip; . But a guy with a fancy title said he expects it&hellip; . That communicates the event is basically inevitable! . (Communicating something is probable/inevitable communicates our the Big 4 Emotion of Safe/Predictable&hellip; . Are you starting to see how these lessons are building on each other more and more?) . I then have to quickly move to a call to action after that credibility line because it was a short email, not a sales letter. . This email has proved consistently that by the time a reader reaches the end of it&hellip; . That about 11% of people are sufficiently intrigued and convinced that whatever this thing is, it&rsquo;s real and interesting enough to them to click the link and learn more... . And these readers get a lot of marketing emails every single day. . Also consider this: Clicking a link is an action the reader has to take. . That&rsquo;s some form of investment or micro-commitment, which is a decent feat in persuasion. . For a copywriter starting their lead, their job is simpler. . They just need make sure the reader takes NO action besides reading the next line. . Another Example: . We can also look back to the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass letter for an example of credibility. . You&rsquo;ll notice that the opening line IS, in fact, credibility. . &ldquo;Dear Reader, . I&rsquo;m Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time.&rdquo; . I had utilized a significant amount of deck copy to expand my headline&hellip; . And dropping credibility in the first line was easy and natural. . There is no hard and fast &ldquo;specific&rdquo; timing with the four things you must do in the lead. . I&rsquo;m not telling you WHAT to write. . I&rsquo;m simply highlighting patterns of subtext that is usually communicated by the best copywriters. . I have personally followed these patterns to great success. . And I know you can too. . So we have captured attention&hellip; . Expanded upon the headline&hellip; . And inserted some credibility&hellip; what now? . The Lead Should Offer The Big Promise . As I stated earlier, you want to get to your big promise as quickly as possible. . There are no specific words you must use. . You should write whatever comes most naturally. . It&rsquo;s possible your Big Promise will change slightly from the time you start your writing until you finish. . That&rsquo;s okay. . When constructing your big promise, use the Big 4 Emotions as a guide: . New / Only | Easy / Anybody | Safe / Predictable | Big / Fast | . Some products lend themselves to certain emotions more than others. . For instance, if a writer wants to sell a product based around a &ldquo;system&hellip;&rdquo; . It could be a system to help lonely, single people go on more dates&hellip; . A system for hopeless couch potatoes to lose 20 pounds&hellip; . A system for broke people to generate passive income&hellip; . It could be anything about a step by step system / push-button solution / done-for-you product&hellip; . The writer may want to lean more heavily on introducing and proving claims about how Fast the system pays out benefits and how Anybody can use it. . The Big Promise should reflect that as well. . If a copywriter is writing about a prediction&hellip; . A trend that the copywriter wants readers to buy into early&hellip; . If the writer is trying to convince a person that something is on its way and the reader needs to act fast&hellip; . Then the copywriter will lean on emotions of New and Big to rile up that fear of missing out. . Throughout the copy, the copywriter will want to hit on as many of the Big 4 Emotions as possible&hellip; . But a writer can lean much more heavily on the two or three that naturally favor their offer. . Which ones the writer chooses as the most important to their message will make up the remainder of their lead. . But if you can, jam as many of the Big 4 Emotions as you can early into your lead. . Let&rsquo;s revisit the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass lead&hellip; . . Here&rsquo;s my Big Promise&hellip; . &ldquo;All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even . $4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out&hellip;&rdquo; . My Big Promise actually states the words &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predictable!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because the promise is for passive income. . Someone who wants passive income wants money to come on auto-pilot. . They don&rsquo;t want to have to tinker with anything. . They don&rsquo;t want to worry about the fluctuations of the stock market. . They just want the money to come and come on time. . Set it and forget it. . So I stress that this is safe and predictable in my promise. . Also, the phrase &ldquo;All it takes&hellip;&rdquo; indicates there is an abundance of &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; in this offer. . And all you need to do is take advantage of a couple of the 49 secrets. Easy. . At the same time I&rsquo;m promising Big income numbers, up in the thousands of dollars. . And the opportunity is totally New because this information has never been in any of the past books that Robert has written! . The Lead Should Open A Loop . At this point in the lead, the writer has brought up their big promise and presented their most compelling claims&hellip; . Now they need to create an &ldquo;open loop.&rdquo; . An open loop is just a &ldquo;tease&rdquo; for information that will be revealed later in the letter. . This is also referred to as a &ldquo;bribe.&rdquo; (I got the term &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; from Clayton Makepeace). . It&rsquo;s a bribe you offer them in exchange for them to continue reading. . Luckily, opening a loop is pretty simple to execute, and can be written like: . &ldquo;In just a second, I will show you exactly how &lsquo;the claims I just said&rsquo; are totally true.&rdquo; This is a simple open loop&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll see variants as you binge copy&hellip; . Another common example: . &ldquo;If you stick with me, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt how you can &lsquo;receive the benefits I promised.&rsquo;&rdquo; . Just look over a couple pieces of copy and next thing you&rsquo;ll know, you&rsquo;ll be able to rattle off 10 different lines to open a loop. . And you&rsquo;ll find methods that are far more subtle than asking the reader to stick around. . In fact, in just a second I&rsquo;ll show you a masterfully written open loop right out of an actual sales letter. . But first&hellip; . Putting A Lead Together . We see the lead usually contains five basic elements . Capture attention | Expand upon the headline | Establish credibility | Make a Big Promise | Open a loop (bribe) | . When you look at leads the way I have described, the job becomes fairly straightforward. . The copywriter should already understand the Soul of his project. . He has summed up his idea in a single sentence. . i.e. for Trump Bonus Checks we used &ldquo;Trump did a thing, now you get paid.&rdquo; Then the copywriter is tasked with proving that idea. . The writers task is to find information that proves the claims&hellip; . Then communicate them through the Big 4 Emotions. . Once you see that, and truly grasp it in your bones&hellip; . Writing copy just becomes a system of answering simple questions. . Start with: . The soul of my promo summed up in a single sentence is&hellip; . Then: . &ldquo;How do I prove this is Big? &nbsp;What can I compare it to that was Big already?&rdquo; . &ldquo;How can I demonstrate to the reader how Easy and Fast this is?&rdquo; . The best writers in the world know this&hellip; . Even though it&rsquo;s quite possible they don&rsquo;t consciously know that they are doing it this way. . Because they think they just &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; . They speak the language of copywriting. . Just like when you talk to your friends&hellip; . You don&rsquo;t consciously realize when you are conjugating verbs or using adjectives to modify nouns. . You just do it. . After years of practice, the master copywriters eventually come to speak the language of copywriting. . But it won&rsquo;t take you years of practice. . Starting today (or whenever you finish this guide)&hellip; . You can look at a line of copy and immediately translate what the writer was trying to accomplish. . And I mean ANY old random line of copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll know EXACTLY why it was written&hellip; even if it is completely out of context! . Any Single Line of Copy . As proof of the practical use of this guide&hellip; . I&rsquo;ve grabbed a single, random line of copy from the lead of a sales letter in my swipe file. . If you&rsquo;ve paid attention to every word up to this point in the guide&hellip; . You know everything you must know to translate its true meaning. . Here&rsquo;s the one line: . &ldquo;Plus multiple triple-digit wins of up to 542% in the coming months...&rdquo; . See if you can use what you&rsquo;ve learned to translate this single, out of context line. . What do you think the writer was trying to communicate? . You know this line is in the lead&hellip; . And you have the Big 4 Emotions framework to go by&hellip; . Take a shot at it on your own, then I&rsquo;ll go into it with you. . Does the translation jump out at you yet? . Let&rsquo;s see if we can figure out what this single line communicates&hellip; REALLY. . Since this is in the lead, it looks like the copywriter is setting up a promise or claim he will have to prove later in the body copy&hellip; . And what are they trying to communicate with this claim? . &ldquo;Multiple&rdquo; = more than one chance to profit = Safe. | &ldquo;Triple digit wins&rdquo; = Big&nbsp;wins. | &ldquo;542%&rdquo; is specific enough to imply some intense calculation has been run to produce this number = Safe. | That 542% number is a pretty nice return = Big. | &ldquo;Coming months&rdquo; = Predictable. | . When you translate each word using just the Big 4 Emotions as your decoder&hellip; . You can see this line was designed to communicate that the opportunity is both Big and Safe. . This is one line of copy from a 37-page promo. . Now imagine you binged and translated copy like this for multiple sales letters&hellip; . You dug into each line to find what it was truly communicating&hellip; . It would not take you long at all before you&rsquo;d see&hellip; . These sales-letter things are all pretty similar. . Then you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . Finally, you&rsquo;ll speak the language of copywriting with ease. . A Quick Exercise: Translate The Copy That Surrounds That Single Line . Below I&rsquo;ll post the rest of the copy that surrounds that single line we just translated. . It&rsquo;s from a sales letter by Money Map Press. . The headline is: . Why the Pentagon Is Securing Millions Worth of the &ldquo;Liquid Technology&rdquo; Inside This Unmarked Tanker I&rsquo;ve dissected this promo on my YouTube. . Since you&rsquo;re probably reading this as a digital copy, I&rsquo;ll give you the URL to that YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/Fv7zwDItHlk . Copy and paste that link and you can see me dissect the entire sales letter for free. . Also, you can have access to my entire swipe file with my notes in the margins by going to: http://kylethewriter.com/swipe . I don&rsquo;t want to make sales pitches inside a book you paid money for, but I thought you might be interested in these free resources. . Here&rsquo;s some of the copywriting that surrounds that single line we just translated: . As you&#39;re probably starting to realize, this is a historic breakthrough. . And if you play it the way I&#39;m going to show you... . You could haul in the kinds of profits that only come around once in a century. . I&#39;m talking about the chance to score up to 10,000% returns or moreover just the next few years... . Plus multiple triple-digit wins of up to 542% in the coming months... . And the potential for literally hundreds of times your money long term. . How can I be SURE this company could score you such huge profits? . I&#39;ll show you right now... . The Pentagon is handing you this win on a silver platter. . | . This is the end of the lead for that promo. . The lead is 382 words long. . Then the writer transitions into the body copy next by introducing the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; in what I call &ldquo;the credibility section.&rdquo; . This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy. . But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip; . Earlier I said I would show you an open loop. . Do you see it? . The open loop was: . &ldquo;If you play it the way I&rsquo;m going to show you&hellip;&rdquo; . The copywriter is SAYING you can make a bunch of money&hellip; . But what he is really communicating &nbsp;is: . &ldquo;I will reveal this method to you&hellip; just keep reading&hellip;&rdquo; . Then the copy goes on to communicate: . &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to miss this, because it&rsquo;s huge! . And if you&rsquo;re nervous, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; it&rsquo;s totally safe.&rdquo; . Again, the more you practice, the more these things will jump out at you. . And I will never, ever, ever have to tell you: &ldquo;write this, write that.&rdquo; &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll just know. . One more open loop example: . If you refer back to the Rich Dad Retirement Masterclass lead&hellip; . The second line is an open loop&hellip; . Dear Reader, . I&rsquo;m Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time. . Today I want to tell you about 49 retirement income secrets I did NOT include in Rich Dad Poor Dad&hellip; . Secrets that the rich love&hellip; but the poor and middle class do not know about! . All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even . $4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out&hellip; . Starting as soon as this coming Monday, January 21, 2019 . | . Oh, one last (secret) open loop example: . Maybe you caught it, but I just opened another loop above: . &ldquo;This is also a great transitioning point for us to start talking about the elements of body copy. . But before we dive into the elements of body copy&hellip; . Earlier I said I would show you an open loop&hellip;&rdquo; . I opened a new loop RIGHT before closing my first loop by saying &ldquo;but before we dive into&hellip;&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s the easiest way to do set up loops. . After finishing this guide and binging a little bit of copy, you&rsquo;ll be able to open loops easily and automatically. . Section 3: The Body Copy . &nbsp; . Believe it or not, things start to get a lot more streamlined in the body copy. . The point of the body copy is for the copywriter to prove their claims from the lead and then any subsequent objections that may come up. . Here&rsquo;s how I like to think about the body copy&hellip; . Imagine that you have totally made your pitch in the lead. . You laid out your opportunity, the exciting promise and maybe some claims about why they should buy today. . Many people are excited and ready to buy. . But there are a bunch of very analytical folks standing there with their arms folded and they say: . &ldquo;Yeah, but...&rdquo; . That is an objection. . That reader has some sort of hesitation about your lead. . In the body copy, the copywriter&rsquo;s job is to anticipate every single &ldquo;Yeah, but&hellip;&rdquo; from their lead&hellip; . And then resolve it. . And if that sounds like a lot, once again, don&rsquo;t worry. . There is a very simple template that you can follow to crush through each objection. . In fact, while I usually recommend following emotions&hellip; . This is one of the few step-by-step templates I recommend you stick to. . You&rsquo;ll also be happy to know that there are some very common objections that are universal to almost every single sale on the planet. . After you overcome them one or two times, it will be second nature for you going forward. . The most complicated part is gathering the proof for overcoming objections. . Again, don&rsquo;t worry. . You can usually grab everything you need from a quick google search. . And once you overcome the most common objections, the bulk of your work in the body copy is done! . &nbsp;So&hellip; . In this section of the guide I&rsquo;ll offer: . The simple template that master copywriters follow when they want to prove their point | The most common objections you must overcome | The most common types of proof you can use to overcome those objections | . Let&rsquo;s start with the proof template. . The Body Template . The body copy will consist almost entirely of a copywriter repeating this single template over and over. . Like most elements of the copywriting language, you would probably never even notice that a sales letter is just repeating this over and over unless you were specifically trained to translate copy. . Good thing you have this guide, huh? . Again, I want to repeat that this is one of the few instances where I say it is a good idea for you to stick to the template almost always. . Jumping straight into the template, here it is: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit | . Feel free to drill this into your brain for a moment&hellip; . Once you grasp these four things, it will make the next two sections super easy to breeze through. . Got these four burned in your brain forever? . Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about it. . Addressing an Objection . An objection is anything in a customer&rsquo;s mind that may prevent them from buying. . An objection doesn&rsquo;t have to be a literal &ldquo;no&rdquo; sort of objection to your claim or promise&hellip; . It could also be a critical piece of information that would cause the reader to refuse to buy unless they knew it. . For instance&hellip; . If a copywriter were to claim, &ldquo;You can make a ton of money with this system&hellip;&rdquo; . A natural set of follow-up questions would be: . &ldquo;Why am I just now hearing about this?&rdquo; | &ldquo;Do I need to have experience to do this?&rdquo; | &ldquo;What guarantees do I have?&rdquo; | &ldquo;How much money can I make?&rdquo; | . None of these are outright literal &ldquo;objections,&rdquo; like someone shouting &ldquo;bullshit!&rdquo; or saying &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; . But we address them as such. . Also, please take a moment to note that I generated all four of these objections in an instant, simply by considering objections to my promise using the frame of The Big 4. . That is, each objection corresponds to one of The Big 4&hellip; . New | Easy | Safe | Big | . It took me mere seconds to generate those four objections, and I could definitely come up with more by considering the 4 alter egos. . Well, you did pay money for this guide (I hope)&hellip; . So just for you I&rsquo;ll go the extra mile now&hellip; . The Alter Egos: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast The objections: | Why should I buy this from you? | What if I don&rsquo;t have any money right now? | How do I know this will work? | How fast will I make money? | . Again, by keeping the Big 4 Emotions top of mind&hellip; . I could generate every answer I needed to communicate without ANY effort. . So now you have a set of objections you can anticipate a reasonable reader to consider. . And all you have to do at this point is follow the body copy template and answer the objections. . Remember: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit&nbsp; | . Observe: . First consider your objection: How much money can I make? . A copywriter may blatantly address the objection in their copy this way: . &ldquo;I bet by now you are probably wondering, &ldquo;how much money can I make?&rsquo;&rdquo; . Or the copywriter can cut that step and just jump straight to the next step of the template: Claim. . Before I dive into claims, I&rsquo;ll just rattle off some of the most common objections you might spot while translating copy&hellip; . Why shouldn&rsquo;t I just use an alternative? | Why should I act now? | Who are you? | Why should I listen to you? | How did you figure this out? | How does it work? | Why are you telling me about this? | Is this going to be difficult? | What do I need to get started? | Will this take a lot of time? | Is this risky? | How much will the results improve my life? / How big are the &ldquo;results?&rdquo; / How much money can I make, etc. | How fast will it take to see results? | How much does it cost? | What if it doesn&rsquo;t work? | . Making a Claim . It&rsquo;s very easy and subtler for a copywriter to anticipate an objection&hellip; . And then start a new section of copy with they state a direct claim that answers the &ldquo;unspoken&rdquo; objection. . The un-stated objection: How much money can I make? . The copywriter turns the answer (a claim) into a subhead: . &ldquo;You can make $10,000 in a week with this system.&rdquo; . Okay, that&rsquo;s a cool. . The copywriter has made their claim. . And he didn&rsquo;t need to directly state the objection (How much money can I make?) in the copy at all. . Now it&rsquo;s time for the proof. . Presenting Proof . Proof is any information that can help the copywriter substantiate their claim. . Generally, proof comes in threes. . That&rsquo;s pretty important. . The writing can feel a little &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; if the writer only offers one or two pieces of proof. . More than three is great&hellip; . But generally, three is the magic number of proof points. . Let&rsquo;s go over the most common types of proof. . Case studies | Demonstrations | Testimonials | Quotes from authorities | Charts and graphs | Official documents | Articles and headlines | . So at this stage of the template the copywriter has claimed the reader can make $10,000 with their system. . But they cannot find three pieces of proof showing $10,000 returns. . The $10,000 mark is just too high. . That&rsquo;s okay. . There&rsquo;s a simple trick for this. . Here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d do. . Proof #1: . &ldquo;Look at what happened when my proprietary system said buy Stock ABC&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock ABC* You could have made $5,000!&rdquo; . Proof #2: . &ldquo;And then the system said buy Stock DEF&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock DEF* You could have made $7,500!&rdquo; . Proof #3: . &ldquo;Now I bet you&rsquo;re pretty convinced this is a great system.&nbsp;But wait until I show you what happened when the system said to buy stock GHI&hellip; . *show a chart of Stock GHI* . You could have made a whopping $10,000!&rdquo; . The copywriter just proved you could make $10,000 with the system and provided three pieces of proof. . Show Don&rsquo;t Tell . When a copywriter is offering up their three or more pieces of proof, they would like &ldquo;show&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tell&rdquo; as often as possible. . You can try to present number gains as visuals, like the charts in the above example. . Generally with each of the three pieces of proof, you&rsquo;ll want to re-present them two to three times in different ways. . This is called a &ldquo;reframe.&rdquo; . Reframing The Proof . So in the above example, the copywriter provided a visual chart AND told the reader about the monetary gains. . That&rsquo;s two&nbsp;presentations. . How else could the copywriter &ldquo;show&rdquo; the reader how much money they were getting? . A good copywriter will try reframe proof often. . Continuing the previous example&hellip; . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . Use my proprietary system to collect that much every month and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a reframe. . I changed the frame from a one-time $10,000 win into a &ldquo;yearly income.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not difficult, see? . All you need to do for a reframe is present a new perspective on the same information. . Another easy way for a copywriter to reframe their proof is just to make a simple, relatable comparison. . Let&rsquo;s try another. . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . That&rsquo;s 765 times more money that what you would have made sticking your money in the S&amp;P 500 for the entire year!&rdquo; . When a copywriter reframes their proof, they are making the proof &ldquo;three-dimensional.&rdquo; In a reader&rsquo;s mind, it becomes more tangible. &nbsp;More real. . When you start to binge copywriting, you will now translate this reframe pattern constantly&hellip; . As a result, you&rsquo;ll start to see new and clever ways to reframe simple pieces of proof. . Showing the Reader The Benefit . Everyone always says, talk about benefits over features. . Finally, here&rsquo;s a copywriter&rsquo;s big chance. . Step 1: They&rsquo;ve anticipated the objection&hellip; . Step 2: They&rsquo;ve stated a claim that combats the objection&hellip; . Step 3: They&rsquo;ve presented three pieces of proof that support the claim AND reframed each to make them three-dimensional&hellip; . Now it&rsquo;s time to talk benefits. . Here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d do it: . Continuing our example after our third piece of proof&hellip; . &ldquo;You could have made a whopping $10,000! . Make that much every month with this system and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income! Won&rsquo;t you be the talk of the town? . Imagine it&hellip; . People will whisper about you, &lsquo;how did he afford that fancy new car?&rsquo; . &lsquo;Did you see his new pool?&rsquo; . &lsquo;What about that trip to Italy he took his family on! Where did he get ALL THAT MONEY?&rsquo;&rdquo; . In this example, I didn&rsquo;t state the benefits directly at the reader. . I &ldquo;showed&rdquo; him the benefits in action. . I showed him the life he could have. . A very easy way a copywriter can illustrate (show don&rsquo;t tell) the benefits to the reader is simply by writing the word: &ldquo;Imagine&hellip;&rdquo; . And then write out whatever the reader would enjoy imagining. . &ldquo;Imagine the look on your friend&rsquo;s faces when you knock 10 strokes off your golf game.&rdquo; . &ldquo;Imagine sleeping easy every night because our debt consolidation service lowered your payments by hundreds of dollars a month.&rdquo; . To keep the copy fresh and avoid an echo&hellip; . A copywriter can just erase the word &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; and tell the reader about the benefits they&rsquo;ll experience. . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll speak with confidence and make friends easily after attending this public speaking class.&rdquo; . A Dark Tip About Benefits . Let me share something with you that I have found to be universally true. . Things that people consider the most personal, are actually the most common. . That is, everyone&rsquo;s personal shame is EVERYONE&rsquo;S personal shame. . Are you jealous of your successful, beautiful best friend who has had it so easy their whole life? . So is everyone else. . Do you resent how you allowed yourself to be manipulated in your last relationship&hellip; . or all your relationships? . So does everyone else. . Do you think you are unlovable for something that you did or happened to you years ago? . Unfortunately, so do most people. . And maybe not all of these apply to you&hellip; . But it is a hell of a bountiful place to start when thinking up how you&rsquo;ll describe benefits. . Everyone wants relief from their fears and frustrations. . They want to stick it to their smug brother in law&hellip; . Or their controlling father&hellip; . Or their Math teacher who said they wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything. . Everyone wants to be somebody. . Everyone wants to feel loved, special, and important. . Everyone wants a life of leisure and pleasure. . The truth is&hellip; . Those things that everyone thinks are most personal and private&hellip; . Are actually the most universal. . Ugly truths we don&rsquo;t want to face about our natures. . But hey, that&rsquo;s just part of being human. . The Seven Deadly Benefits . Another way to think about this &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of benefits stuff, is to consider the seven deadly sins. . Lust | Gluttony | Greed | Sloth | Wrath | Envy | Pride | People want a life full of this stuff. . That&rsquo;s why they buy things. . They want a solution that makes things easier so they can lounge around. . They want something to make them RICH so they can lord it over their judgmental father in law&hellip; . They want to have a better golf game because they want to have some dignity (pride) when they play beside their skilled friends. . When you think of presenting benefits from these sort of &ldquo;dark&rdquo; places&hellip; . Then you&rsquo;ll be able to paint a most beautiful picture for your reader. . Now when you see the word &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; in a piece of copy&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll immediately translate the words following as the copywriter&rsquo;s presentation of benefits&hellip; . And maybe even trace them directly to one of the seven deadly sins. . Examples of the Body Copy Template In Action . The first example is very special to me. . It&rsquo;s one of the first claims I ever wrote and proved in a sales letter. . I want you to pay attention to how simple this example is. . The structure is painfully obvious and elementary. . But it works! . As of today, this letter has been making me money every single day for about a year. . Here&rsquo;s the example, from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . You Need to Act Fast&hellip; Because Silicon Valley Insiders Are Getting Rich With Each Passing Day . You see, behind the scenes&hellip; . In the private market&hellip; . This company is already making some of my venture capitalist friends filthy rich. . For example, one of my friends who&rsquo;s a Silicon Valley insider (he asked me not to mention his name) says he turned $25,000 into nearly $60 million. . Bill Gurley, considered one of technology&rsquo;s top dealmakers, got in early&hellip; . and his investment grew 58,233% to over $7 billion! . Shark Tank guest Chris Sacca saw his investment soar 933,233%. &nbsp;His stake is now worth over $2.8 billion! . With those types of gains, a $1,000 investment would have made you over $9 million already! . That&rsquo;s crazy, right? . | . The Objection is:&nbsp;why should I act fast? . The claim is:&nbsp;Silicon Valley insiders are already getting rich. You&rsquo;re missing out. . The proof is: I provided three examples of rich investors as my three pieces of proof. . I wrote the benefit in turns of a small investment making you rich. . This is how simple copywriting can be for you. . Now let&rsquo;s look closer&hellip; . Because I&rsquo;m talking about James Altucher&rsquo;s &ldquo;venture capitalist friends&rdquo; it offers an exclusive &ldquo;insider&rdquo; look. . Triggering the Only emotion. . The $1,000 indicates it is Easy to get rich from this. . Because big name investors and prominent people are putting in their money, you can feel assured this isn&rsquo;t a scam. . SAFE. . And $1,000 turning into over $9 million? It doesn&rsquo;t get much Bigger than that. . Let&rsquo;s look at another example. . This example will be much more sophisticated because of my experience after a year of writing at Agora Financial. . This is proof presented in the form of a case study for Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass. . A Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week . This one secret move could not only supplement your retirement, but could bring in more money than your salary alone. . I&rsquo;m sure George was a little scared of trying something new... . Something outside the stock market, bonds, typical real estate or anything you might have heard before. . &ldquo;At first I was really skeptical. . I didn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; . But thanks to this little-known, one-time move&hellip; . George was able to immediately gross $96,000 in yearly income for himself and his family. . While I haven&#39;t had a chance to personally vet his financials&hellip; . Just imagine pocketing the equivalent of $1,846&hellip; every single week&hellip; for LIFE. . More money than most people collect from an entire month of Social Security. . And George says he only spends about an hour a week checking in on his income! . Which is about &ldquo;eight to nine thousand,&rdquo; he whispered in amazement. . Now George has a reliable way to keep making a lot of money in retirement&hellip; . George says his own family has a hard time believing his rapid success. . Because most folks have never heard of such a lucrative strategy as this. . | . The objection is: Will this be hard? . My claim is:&nbsp;&ldquo;A Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week.&rdquo; . My proof is:&nbsp;George&rsquo;s story. . He&rsquo;s a regular, skeptical guy who executed a little-known, one-time move to collect $96,000 in yearly income. . I asked the reader to imagine the benefits of $1,846 every single week for life. . I reframed the amount by comparing it to social security. . I also make sure to cover the Big 4 Emotions&hellip; . Inside my story I suggest George was trying something NEW. . I insist most people don&rsquo;t know this secret. . ONLY (New&rsquo;s alter ego) I do. . I tell the reader it is only a one-time move. . It doesn&rsquo;t require a ton of work. . It&rsquo;s EASY. . I address the reader&rsquo;s skepticism through George and his own shock. . Ensuring it is SAFE and ANYBODY (Easy&rsquo;s alter ego) can do it. . George&rsquo;s checks come in &ldquo;eight to nine thousand&rdquo; a month. . PREDICTABLE (Safe&rsquo;s alter ego) income. . And for a one-time move, eight to nine thousand a month is pretty damn BIG and FAST. . Rinse and repeat for the next section of the body copy. . Just remember to check off as many of the Big 4 boxes as possible. . The reader will be convinced. . Then all that&rsquo;s left to do is take their money. . Wrapping Up The Body Copy Template . There you have it&hellip; . When you look at nearly any piece of copy, particularly long-form&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll find that the very best performers in the world follow this simple step-by-step template in their body copy: . Objection | Claim | Proof | Benefit | . The next time you read a piece of body copy, you should now be able to dissect virtually every line&hellip; . And you&rsquo;ll be able to easily translate each line to determine what stage the writer is at in their communication. . Are they communicating a claim that they want you to believe? . Are they communicating proof as to WHY you should believe them? Or are they communicating a benefit? . Are they showing you how, if you&rsquo;ll just listen to them, your wildest dreams will come true? . Seeing this pattern will become second nature to you, now that it is part of your copywriting lexicon. . And you&rsquo;ll be surprised how universal it is. . Common Sections in the Body Copy . Now that you know how to present your information, I&rsquo;m going to list some common sections in the body copy and go over them with you. . Sometimes these ideas are presented in the lead in a single line&hellip; . Then elaborated further in the body copy with an entire section following the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template. . The following list of sections aren&rsquo;t official definitions you&rsquo;ve read anywhere else in the world&hellip; . Because they are names I personally gave to patterns I recognized while translating literally thousands of pages of copy. . Better Than Section | The Last Time This Happened Section | Guru/Credibility Section | Discovery Story | Key Insight | Layman&rsquo;s Explanation | Technical Explanation | . The first two sections listed are a little unique. . Because it is common for these to be in the grey area that could be LEAD or body copy, depending on who you talk to. . But they do follow the Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit template. . Two Quick Tips for Building A Strong Lead And Starting the Body Copy With A Bang . There are two sections of copy I really like to include in a lead where I&rsquo;m presenting a large opportunity. . I typically use these two sections in a customer acquisition sales letter, or a &ldquo;front end&rdquo; promotion. . A front-end promotion is a low-priced offer of around $50 or less&hellip; . It&rsquo;s designed to get the customer to buy something from you and get into your customer list. . &nbsp;A back-end promotion is a high-priced offer of anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 or beyond&hellip; . It&rsquo;s designed to generate a ton of profits. . You don&rsquo;t need to know much more than that. . With what I&rsquo;ve taught you thus far, the next two sections should make sense&hellip; . And once you grasp the core concepts I show you, you&rsquo;ll be able to immediately translate these sections into what any copywriter is really trying to communicate. . The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section . The first section I call The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section&hellip; . And it is exactly what it sounds like! . After you hit all the core elements of a lead as explained above, you simply want to communicate the following message in a subhead&hellip; . &ldquo;This opportunity is &lsquo;better than&rsquo; the best, hottest thing out there right now.&rdquo; . Since I write financial copy, I love to go to something like Amazon or Facebook for this section. . For instance, FAANG stocks were all the rave in 2018. . Investors thought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google were the MUST HAVE stocks. . So, for a &ldquo;better than&rdquo; section I might say something like: . &ldquo;This single opportunity will deliver bigger profits than all the FAANG stocks put together!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my claim. . Then I would find a quote or figure about my opportunity from a news source&hellip; . One that would support the idea that you could make more with my opportunity than the FAANG stocks&hellip; . Then I might grab a chart or think of a comparison to draw&hellip; . And then one other piece of proof. . Bingo bango, that&rsquo;s one awesome &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section all done. . What Does A &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; Section Communicate? . The &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section simultaneously builds the hype for your opportunity&hellip; . Which makes it perfect for around the lead&hellip; . While also selling the reader OUT of doing the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment. . Selling out of something basically means selling &ldquo;away&rdquo; from something&hellip; . It&rsquo;s the process of selling someone on NOT doing something else. . Because one objection the reader might have is, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just do this thing that&rsquo;s hot right now?&rdquo; . I recommend you knock that objection out early. . Now, which emotion I communicate is up to the angle of my claim and the proof I fetch. . For instance, if I say &ldquo;you can make more money with my opportunity than with FAANG stocks&hellip;&rdquo; . Then I am communicating my opportunity is BIG. . If I say my opportunity has consistently outperformed FAANG, I am communicating it is BIG and SAFE. . So pick and choose what you want to specifically communicate for your opportunity. . But no matter what: I MUST communicate one of The Big 4 or the section is worthless. . Here&rsquo;s an example of the Better Than section from The Hottest IPO and it will pick up where my last example left off&hellip; . With those types of gains, a $1,000 investment would have made you over $9 million already! . That&rsquo;s crazy, right? . That&rsquo;s Even Better Than Bitcoin . I don&rsquo;t know of any other asset that could grow your wealth so fast. . For example, the mainstream media likes to say that Bitcoin is the best performance asset in the entire world. . Sure, Bitcoin has minted tons of millionaires. . But this private company is making people even more money! . Over the last 12 months, Bitcoin has delivered around 800% returns for investors. . But we have seen over 900,000% gains from this private startup. . That&rsquo;s over 1,000 times higher than Bitcoin! . No wonder Business Insider calls this company &ldquo;the most valuable startup in the U.S. and across the globe.&rdquo; . | . When The Hottest IPO was written, Bitcoin was all the hype. . It was the &ldquo;popular thing&rdquo; of the moment I needed to sell away from. . When I re-wrote the lead of Hottest IPO for the $15 Trillion Gadget, it made sense to update my example. . Here is how the &ldquo;Better Than&rdquo; section was presented in the $15 Trillion Gadget. . . &nbsp; . The Second One I Call &ldquo;The Last Time Something Like This Happened&rdquo; (TLTSLTH) Section . This can go early in the copy, near the lead because it is a Big, hype-driven section. . To employ the TLTSLTH section, simply communicate the following message in a subhead: . &ldquo;The last time something like this happened was over 25 years ago!&rdquo; . Then I tell the story about what happened 25 years ago&hellip; . Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger. . &ldquo;The last time something like this opportunity happened, people became wildly happy!&rdquo; . So for something like financial copywriting, you might write something like: . &ldquo;The last time a tax bill like this was passed, millionaires were minted overnight.&rdquo; . Then you explain how people got rich from a similar opportunity&hellip; . Only this time: It&rsquo;s much bigger. . By showing a historical case study, I have introduced a pattern&hellip; . And therefore, Predictability. . The legendary Gary Halbert did this in his famous &ldquo;Water Ad.&rdquo; . WARNING: Do Not Read This Unless You Are Already Rich! . If you would like to know how someone can start with a simple idea... and then... generate over $51,000,000 in sales in just one year... this is going to be the most interesting message you will ever read. &nbsp;Here is why: &nbsp;There&#39;s a guy in California named Carl Palmer who, until recently, was very wealthy and very bored. &nbsp;He got rich (the first time) by starting a company in 1970 which he sold out to Coca-Cola just three years later in 1973. &nbsp; As part of the deal, he had to sign a &quot;non-compete&quot; agreement with a duration of five years. &nbsp;After that five years ended, he went back in business and built up another company which was soon acquired by the giant AMF Corporation. &nbsp;After that, Carl developed Shackley&#39;s reverse osmosis home water filtration system... and... in the first year... &nbsp;they did $51 million in sales with that product. &nbsp;And so on. &nbsp;You get the idea. &nbsp;What this guy does is, he comes up with enormously valuable inventions, starts a company to sell those inventions... &nbsp;and soon... he goes nuts with all the hassles of running a business... and so... &nbsp;he sells out (at a huge profit) to some giant corporation that has the resources and the clout to exploit the living daylights out of whatever it is he has invented. &nbsp;But now, he has outdone himself. &nbsp;Now, at the request of the Seychelle Technologies, Inc., he has invented something that is needed by every human being in the world... and... . This Invention Is Almost Certain To Generate Billions In Sales! . | . Pay attention to how Halbert explains the pattern between &ldquo;You get the idea&rdquo; and &ldquo;But now, he has outdone himself.&rdquo; . This is a huge booster for the Safe emotion because it creates a very valuable and Predictable pattern for the reader to believe in&hellip; . Knowing this, you should be able to immediately translate what it is copywriters are REALLY trying to communicate when they explain history to you. . The Guru/Credibility Section . The Guru or &ldquo;Credibility&rdquo; section is pretty much ubiquitous in all pieces of copy&hellip; . It&rsquo;s also where I draw a hard, black and white line for transition from the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;body copy.&rdquo; . When you see the credibility section, you are officially in the body copy. . The credibility section is designed to overcome the &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why should I listen to you?&rdquo; objections. . So while you are binging and translating copywriting you&rsquo;ll notice the credibility section communicates: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo; . That is the copywriter&rsquo;s claim: &ldquo;You should listen to me.&rdquo; . Generally, the copywriter will introduce the guru and then list some reasons the guru is credible. . That can include photos with prominent, credible people&hellip; . A list of appearances on authority sources, like being on TV and news networks&hellip; . Or a track record of success or accurate predictions. . Usually, you won&rsquo;t see case studies or testimonials at this point. . Those are mostly reserved for the Offer Copy, which we will cover in a little bit. . Here&rsquo;s an example Guru Section from The Hottest IPO&hellip; . Notice the variety of sources that really show the reader: &ldquo;James Altucher is a very credible guy you should listen to!&rdquo; . . . &nbsp; . The Discovery Story . The discovery story or &ldquo;key insight&rdquo; section usually tells the story of how the guru came across this breakthrough opportunity. . It addresses the objection: &ldquo;how do you know about this?&rdquo; . And usually communicates some element of New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . That is, the story could be about a key piece of information gathered from a secret source&hellip; . Or some elite network&hellip; . The proof would simply be offering proof such a relationship exists between the guru and the secret source. . Made Up Example: . Here&rsquo;s a made up example off the top of my head, and we will build on this in the coming sections&hellip; . &ldquo;As you know, I have worked on government projects before. . And on one of these projects I overheard a secret meeting. . Afterward, I approached one of the men and asked him about it, and what he shared with me blew my mind. . I can&rsquo;t tell you all the details here&hellip; . All you need to know is this is the most explosive opportunity I&rsquo;ve ever come across.&rdquo; . This example lets the reader know there is a secret government opportunity only our guru knows about. . So you just want to communicate that this information is not available to the whole world. . In fact, it was by chance that our guru luckily discovered this opportunity, thanks to his personal circumstances. . That&rsquo;s Big 4 Emotion New/&ldquo;Only.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how we did that for The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Then the writer can transition into the key insight section. . The Key Insight . The key insight is the single piece (or pieces) of information the reader must know to be true in order to believe the opportunity is real. . Continuing the Made-Up Example: . Let&rsquo;s expand upon our made-up secret government opportunity from earlier&hellip; . &ldquo;The mysterious man told me about a secret government contract with major chip manufacturers around the world that would set up a $250 billion industry.&rdquo; . How can you make the reader believe this is true? . The writer can back this big claim up with proof using &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of things to come. . The writing is on the wall so to speak. (Safe/Predictable) . A writer may say something like&hellip; . &ldquo;Even though everyone has been kept hush hush, several prominent chip companies have quietly enjoyed explosion in their stocks recently. . That&rsquo;s because the insiders know what&rsquo;s happening and they&rsquo;re pouring in money now.&rdquo; . Again I&rsquo;m just making all this up. . But because I speak the language of copywriting&hellip; . I know what message I must communicate, and it just flows from my fingers. . I just need to tell you that I know one important piece of information that is setting up something big. . Then I write what that might sound like. . My skills have sharpened from binging copywriting. . And now the patterns have become so obvious to me, almost to the point of being dull. . It took me about a year to learn and develop this method. . And now, thanks to this guide, you&rsquo;ll be able to speak the copywriting language in no time&hellip; . And replicate my skill in a matter of weeks. . Real copy example: . Here&rsquo;s a real example of how we used our key piece of information about &ldquo;IBM&rsquo;s announcement&rdquo; in 70 Cent Crypto: . . The reader must understand that IBM is on board with this crypto and that their involvement is what will cause this whole opportunity to work. . I backed that claim up with examples of old announcements for other cryptos that took place before a crypto exploded in price. . Another challenge in this promo was convincing the reader that Bitcoin was on its way out, and our coin was the better coin. . Here&rsquo;s the key insight we used to prove that point: . . The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation . The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation addresses the objection: &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; . But the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is only one part of addressing that objection&hellip; . More on that in a moment. . Basically, The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation is where you&rsquo;ll explain how the opportunity functions&hellip; . And do so in a way that two people half-drunk at the bar would be able to explain it to each other. . This is a cousin of the key insight. . Remember the Big 4 emotions when creating The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation. . So, picture two people hunched over at the bar. . Their faces are red and their eyes are half-closed from drinking too much. . Person 1 says to Person 2, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bunch of bullshit. . You&rsquo;ll believe anything you read online.&rdquo; What Person 2 says in reply IS the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation section. . If it&rsquo;s a system you&rsquo;re selling, the drunkard will reply with something like&hellip; . &ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple. You just follow these three steps and BAM. Success. . Listen, the secret is the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. . It&rsquo;s this new thing scientists discovered that makes the whole thing work. &nbsp; . I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. &nbsp;Until I heard about that &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; . I&rsquo;m telling you... &nbsp;This is the real deal.&rdquo; . . If it is our government contract example I just made up above, Person 2&rsquo;s reply would be something like: . &ldquo;Nooo. Look, it&rsquo;s simple. . Ya know how the government spends billions of dollars every year on war? . Well now there&rsquo;s a NEW sector and it&rsquo;s WAY cheaper than the old way... . So the government is going all in RIGHT NOW! I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. . They got these computers now that can do 500 times what the old technology did and at a fraction of the cost! . I thought the same thing you&rsquo;re thinking now. Until I heard about that new sector. . I&rsquo;m telling you&hellip; This is the real deal.&rdquo; . . Again, I&rsquo;m totally making all this stuff up on the spot. . I know I must communicate a SIMPLE key piece of information that a person falling over drunk could communicate to a skeptical friend at the bar. . That&rsquo;s what I call: &ldquo;The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did The Layman&rsquo;s Explanation: . . If you were drunk at the bar with a friend&hellip; could you explain this to them? . &ldquo;This dude has this secret formula&hellip; or crazy algorithm&hellip; . And it PREDICTS the stock market. &nbsp;I know, it sounds crazy. But it was over 90% accurate!&rdquo; . Even though the copywriter talks a bunch of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; about the algorithm in the above section, he doesn&rsquo;t really tell you how it works&hellip; . Just that &ldquo;it works.&rdquo; . The Technical Explanation . The Technical Explanation is just the Layman&rsquo;s Explanation dressed up in a lab coat with glasses. . If it were a system I were selling, I would go into crazy detail about the science behind the &ldquo;patented technology.&rdquo; . So much detail as to fly over the head of the reader. . And that is by design. . For instance, I could present the complicated scientific formula that makes it all work. . This communicates, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smarter than you. &nbsp;Trust me.&rdquo; . For the made-up government contracts example we have above, I could talk about computer chips in more detail. . I could mention the microns and nanosecond reaction times or something. . Here&rsquo;s how they did it in The Money Zone: . . The copywriter is throwing so much jargon and technical stuff at the reader so they will think to themselves, &ldquo;Okay, okay, I don&rsquo;t understand any of this stuff. I&rsquo;m not a computer genius. Whatever.&rdquo; . Even though the reader doesn&rsquo;t actually want to know or learn this complicated stuff, they want reassurance the guru DOES know it. . Safe/Predictable. . Wrapping Up The Body Copy . You now know some of the most common elements of the body copy section in a piece of copy. . The stuff you&rsquo;ve learned is verypowerful. . I must confess that I am feeling a desire to invest in one of those government contract chip companies we made up&hellip; . Even though I KNOW logically, that I just made all that stuff up about a new &ldquo;sector&rdquo; and government opportunity . I know, logically, that opportunity doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; . But my emotions are not rational. . They do not understand logic. . They are reactive, and the words I typed in the make-believe examples are emotionally exciting. . The language of copywriting is communicated purely through subtext. . The language of copywriting isn&rsquo;t about what is said, it is about what is communicated. . The things REALLY being communicating by a skilled copywriter will bypass the reader&rsquo;s rational, logical levels of the brain&hellip; . And go directly to pulling their emotional strings. . In learning how to translate that language yourself&hellip; . You are learning how to communicate directly to a human being&rsquo;s emotional and core desires. . Section 4: The Offer . Hooray, we&rsquo;ve made it to the offer! . It&rsquo;s all downhill from here&hellip; sort of. . Generally, the offer section in long form direct response copy occupies the last twenty to thirty percent of the text. . It&rsquo;s very similar to the format of any &ldquo;free webinar&rdquo; you might have attended. . You get about 45 minutes of content&hellip; . Followed by a 15-minute pitch&hellip; . And sometimes, if the webinar host is feeling generous, you get about 30-40 minutes Q&amp;A. . Frankly, it&rsquo;s no different in copywriting&hellip; . Because webinars are based on high performing sales techniques and often scripted by copywriters! . What To Look For In An Offer . A ton of information must be conveyed quickly and directly in an offer&hellip; . This is the part of your copy where you will be asking a reader to whip out their credit card, so you want to make sure they have NO reason not to&hellip; . That means being crystal clear with details and instructions for them to follow. . Here are the most common elements that make up the offer section: . Summarize everything discussed so far | Intro report | Intro service | The unique selling proposition | How it works / What to expect / What you get | Pump in some cred | . Add bonuses | Share testimonials | Recap | Offer guarantee | Limit the Spots or Quantity | Set a deadline | Ask for sale | . These do not have to be presented in a specific order&hellip; . But the order I&rsquo;ve presented above is pretty clean and effective. . Remember to keep the Big 4 top of mind when writing every word of your copy&hellip; . Even the offer section. . Because directly stating information about something, is NOT copywriting. . That is educating... . That&rsquo;s a blog post. . If you are telling, you aren&rsquo;t selling. . So there is an art that comes in conveying your information and instruction&hellip;. . While continuing to SELL them on the offer section. . The persuasive message must continue to be subtly communicated, while being intertwined with the information. . Don&rsquo;t skip over that part&hellip; . Because that is &ldquo;the copywriting part.&rdquo; . I hope you&rsquo;re excited to learn how to structure and create a compelling offer in this section. . Once you learn to spot these patterns in the copy, and tease out what a copywriter is really communicating&hellip; . You will be able to write your own offer copy with ease. . A Membership or Subscription Service Is One of the Most Complicated Offers . The reason membership and subscription offers are so complicated is because the SELLER is usually selling a subscription&hellip; . While the BUYER is usually interested in buying into the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; or &ldquo;system&rdquo; that has been teased throughout the copy. . As such, the offer section will require an introduction of both the &ldquo;report&rdquo; that explains the opportunity&hellip; . And then must also introduce the subscription service itself. . So let&rsquo;s take my government contract example I made up earlier. . I&rsquo;ve explained to you there is a huge opportunity to profit off these secret government contracts&hellip; . And I&rsquo;ve put all the details for you in a nice little report. . The report is called, Report X. . Guess what? Report X is free. . Here are the details inside: x&hellip; y&hellip; and z&hellip; . i.e. &ldquo;Inside you&rsquo;ll learn: Exactly how to profit, what ticker symbol to invest in, and my sophisticated, full research.&rdquo; . The report will reveal everything the reader desperately wants to know that was only teased in the sales letter. . But the objective of the copywriter is to get a new subscriber&hellip; . So they might write something like: . &ldquo;But in order to receive the free report, you must subscribe to my newsletter or membership service, &lsquo;The ABC Club&rsquo; for $49 per year.&rdquo; . Get it now? I&rsquo;m actually selling the subscription service. . That just adds a slight wrinkle to information you must convey in the offer. . But it&rsquo;s no big deal. . You can use a similar setup for anything else you&rsquo;re selling. . If I&rsquo;m selling basketball training&hellip; . I could write an entire sales letter about, “The one secret to being a better basketball player than Lebron James.” . I could talk about that one secret the whole time. . I could illustrate how it is New, Safe, Easy, and Big. . Then say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the secret when you join my basketball training club.&rdquo; . Until the offer section, the reader may have never known there was a club! . And that&rsquo;s okay. . It&rsquo;s up to you what items you select to highlight in your copy... . You may want to test a couple angles and find the best performing one, then ditch the others. . Here&rsquo;s an example of introducing the report and subscription service from The 70 Cent Crypto. . . There&rsquo;s a lot happening in this example. . Let&rsquo;s just focus on the report and subscription service. . At the top we introduce the information the reader wants, using a dossier: The $.70 Crypto That Could Make You Rich in 2018. . At the bottom we introduce the subscription service that will grant you access. . Then we explain that in order to get the dossier, you must join the subscription service: . . Working Backwards and Building Your Offer . In just a second we&rsquo;ll dive full into the elements of an offer section&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll see exactly what information you must tell&hellip; . But I want to remind you about the most important aspect about the language of copywriting. . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . You&rsquo;ll be happy to know, there are still only 4 main things you&rsquo;ll want to keep top of mind when writing an offer: . New/Only | Easy/Anybody | Safe/Predictable | Big/Fast | . So when you&rsquo;re reading an offer by a master copywriter, see if you can recognize examples of them weaving the Big 4 (and their alter-egos) into the information to make it more exciting. . Okay, I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting long enough&hellip; . Let&rsquo;s dive into the elements of typical offer copy. . Summarize Everything Discussed Before . In the lesson on body copy, you learned that body copy follows a typical structure of: Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit format. . Once one claim is proven and the benefits presented, there is an opportunity for the copywriter to weave in a quick reminder about the opportunity before moving on and presenting a new claim in the next section. . That&rsquo;s why the following part of the offer copy should stick out like a sore thumb&hellip; . You&rsquo;ll notice you are about 70 percent through the copy and it seems like you&rsquo;re re-reading the lead all over again. . No new information is being presented&hellip; . No new claim is being proven&hellip; . At this point your brain will see the pattern: You know you are reaching the offer copy. . In a moment, the writer will present you with the opportunity to &ldquo;get in&rdquo; on what he&rsquo;s been hyping up, via some product offer or report. . So in order to get you in the state of mind to badly want that thing (usually a report)&hellip; . He is going to use the same hype from the lead to get you hype again. . This part will be similar to the lead. . Sometimes instead of presenting claims, the writer will suggest he has fulfilled all their claims from earlier. . Like this: . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the proof that X Claim is happening&hellip; I&rsquo;ve shown you the proof about Y Claim. . And now you can get the details in X Report.&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Here it is in The Hottest IPO: . . Intro Report . See how easily that flowed? . We recapped, rebuilt the hype that caused you to read in the first place, then presented you with an opportunity to &ldquo;get in.&rdquo; . You&rsquo;ll also notice, we REALLY jack up the urgency as we get closer and closer to the close of the letter. . More on urgency in a moment. . When you see a copywriter intro the report, you&rsquo;ll notice the copywriter doesn&rsquo;t give away the specifics inside. . Instead, they tell you about the information you, the reader, hope to get from inside. . &ldquo;Once you have this report, it will only take you 5 minutes and 3 clicks of your mouse to get in front of this life-changing opportunity!&rdquo; . Notice that in this made-up example, I don&rsquo;t go into boring details inside the report. . Instead, I stick to my core emotions, the Big 4 Emotions. . This particular line, I highlight how easy, fast, and big this all is. . And the fact that they don&rsquo;t know the information in my report and I am holding it, triggers New/Only. . Bam. All four hit. . And I didn&rsquo;t give away anything. . Not only is withholding the details MORE effective&hellip; . Divulging the details is INEFFECTIVE and actually HARMFUL. . There&rsquo;s two reasons for that. . Information is not sexy | The reader may believe they have this &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo; | Point one: Information is not sexy. . The human brain cannot deal with raw data. . Sure, it can solve problems and calculate things&hellip; . But it cannot come to an emotional or motivated conclusion based on facts. . It needs a story to guide that motivation. . That&rsquo;s what copywriting is. . So always remember&hellip; . Even though the reader wants this information, BADLY even&hellip; . Giving it to them will NOT work. . Because it is not scientifically possible to excite them to action with raw data. . If you activate their calculating, analytical part of the brain, even for a moment, that kills all the momentum you&rsquo;ve built. . In fact, make sure that you are mostly presenting stories in your body copy too. . Never just use raw data as proof. . As for the second point: the reader cannot be allowed to think they have your secret &ldquo;figured out.&rdquo; . &nbsp;The moment they think, “Oh I think I know what this secret is… I can do this on my own…” . ...Then they are gone. . They&rsquo;ll either try to do it on their own&hellip; . Or they will try and find another version of your secret for cheaper, if they think they know what your thing is. . You must never allow your opportunity to be categorized as a commodity. . If that happens, it&rsquo;s &nbsp;over. . On that note: You can keep your report from being &ldquo;another boring old report&rdquo; by calling it something else. . Anything else! . Dossier, Bulletin, Hot Sheet, Guide, Manual. . These are just a few quick examples. . You&rsquo;ll notice we called the report in The 70 Cent Crypto a &ldquo;dossier.&rdquo; . And we called the Pre-IPO Prospectus a &ldquo;prospectus.&rdquo; . But I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to write. . That would not serve you. . Writing copy is not a &ldquo;how to.&rdquo; . Instead, you must binge on copy, translate out the subtext, and then you&rsquo;ll know what to look for when you see another writer Intro the Report in their offer section. . After seeing a couple examples, you&rsquo;ll quickly come up with New, unique names for your own report with a little bit of thought. . You&rsquo;ll see ways to weave New, Safe, Easy, and Big into your report tease. . At this point, the copywriter has summarized the exciting stuff&hellip; . Introduced their report and teased some key information&hellip; . And now they&rsquo;ll drop a line like: . &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . Or&hellip; . &ldquo;As soon as you RSVP your spot in my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . . Intro The Service . This is the real offer you want to the reader to take&hellip; . A quick note about the &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; line&hellip; . &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free&hellip; . As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.&rdquo; . Usually the words trial offer only appear in front end products, where the price is $49 and they can get their money back if unsatisfied. . The words &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t usually appear in back end offers&hellip; . Because back end offers are priced at $2,000 and above&hellip; . And you don&rsquo;t want the customer to buy, steal the information in the report, and then ask for a refund. . So most folks do not offer a &ldquo;trial offer&rdquo; for back ends. . Many folks do not offer refunds for back ends at all. . You&rsquo;ve seen examples of how a writer might introduce the report and then the service&hellip; . And you&rsquo;ll pick up more as you binge copy. . So now what? . Now it&rsquo;s time to sell the service itself. . The first thing to do&hellip; . Explain the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) . The unique selling proposition is what makes your service DIFFERENT. . The USP will trigger New/Only for your reader and your presentation can be pretty straight forward: . “The only service that...” . ...and you say the logical thing that comes to mind. . It may be the only service that uses the special system you&rsquo;ve been teasing. . Or the only service that does things the special way they do&hellip; . Or has the special people involved that are involved. . It just has to be &ldquo;unique&rdquo; to be a unique selling proposition. . One thing that is important, and many people get hung up on... . Your USP doesn&rsquo;t even have to be THAT &ldquo;unique.&rdquo; . Sounds like I&rsquo;m contradicting myself now, huh? . So there are three ways to create a USP. . Have something actually unique | Label something common as unique | Give something &ldquo;old&rdquo; a new name | Actually Unique . You can use something truly unique, like a proprietary formula or patented technology or process&hellip; . Label Something Common as Unique . Or you can highlight something COMMON about your product that nobody else has highlighted before. . A classic example comes from a company that was having trouble selling fire alarms. . They brought on a copywriter who asked how the alarms were made. . After going over how the alarms were made, the copywriter said, &ldquo;These connectors are gold plated. . We should sell that.&rdquo; . The manufacturer said, &ldquo;all company&rsquo;s connectors are gold plated.&rdquo; . The copywriter said, &ldquo;but nobody is talking about it!&rdquo; . I got that story from Joseph Sugarman&rsquo;s Adweek Copywriting Handbook, I believe. . Give Something &ldquo;Old&rdquo; A New Name . The South Beach diet failed in its first several iterations because it was named &ldquo;The modified carbohydrate diet.&rdquo; . That was not new and not sexy. . So they called the same old thing something new, &ldquo;The South Beach Diet&rdquo; and bam, national success. . One more example&hellip; . The iPod was not an original idea. . There were TONS of MP3 players all over the market, made by a zillion manufacturers. . But Steve Jobs in his infinite wisdom decided to market the iPod as &ldquo;1,000 songs in your pocket.&rdquo; . All of a sudden, Apple&rsquo;s MP3 player was super unique and exciting. . It didn&rsquo;t play songs differently than any other MP3 player, but it sure was the most popular. . It will only take reading a handful of examples before you really spot this trend and quickly come up with your own ideas. . Another very common way to communicate the USP is to start a sentence with &ldquo;my mission with Service XYZ is to&hellip;&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how we did it in The Hottest IPO&hellip; . . Notice how we make The Altucher Report unique by labeling it the &ldquo;ONLY place where I&rsquo;ll personally update you on emerging new ways to earn more income and grow your wealth&hellip;&rdquo; . Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone introduced their service and made it unique: . . How it Works / What to Expect / What You Get . The next thing you have to do once you have told the reader why your product is unique, is tell them what to expect from their experience. . You&rsquo;ll notice copywriters make it as clear as possible, answering questions like: What comes with this service or membership? . How often will I receive an email? . What will be in the emails? . Pro Tip: put a graphic of an actual email&hellip; . Presented like a sheet of paper with the letter head and text and everything&hellip; . That way the reader can see it, and it will help them recognize the format, the branding, and most importantly&hellip; . What to expect! . This is also a great time to include anything else that comes standard with the offer. . That could be special access to an exclusive website, a customer service number, or any other regular emails they might receive. . Because your competitors will probably be offering similar things, you will want to &ldquo;dress&rdquo; your standard offering &ldquo;up.&rdquo; . You&rsquo;ll see it in the copy while you&rsquo;re binging. . Call your report something weird. . Call your website something weird. . Instead of just saying, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s our customer service phone number,&rdquo; say something like, &ldquo;We have a dedicated team of specialists to support you for this project. Here&rsquo;s their number.&rdquo; . No matter where you are in the copy, every element should feel New. . When you are in the offer section, it is really tempting to just say, &ldquo;this is what you want, here it is&hellip;&rdquo; and just give them the information. . But you have to fight against that urge. . Even in the offer section, you should make every effort to keep the reader from thinking, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen this before.&rdquo; . And while making your offer, remember, specifics are key. . And in the specifics, you want to emphasize how EASY you&rsquo;ve made everything. . &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll receive an email from me every Monday morning when the markets open.Inside I&rsquo;ll include commentary about the markets, one trade recommendation, and step by step instructions to execute that trade if you wish to invest.Everything you need to get in the trade is right there in the email, and you can be in any of these trades in mere minutes.You don&rsquo;t need a special brokerage account, any old one will do... . You don&rsquo;t need a specific amount of money, either.In fact, anybody can follow these simple instructions with just an internet connection and 10 minutes of time.&rdquo; . I just made all that up. . As someone who speaks the language of copy, I don&rsquo;t have to really consult any outside resources or think hard about this stuff. . I know I just need to make this part sound really EASY. . Because after thousands of hours binging copy&hellip; not reading ABOUT copy&hellip; . I have seen that all the great copywriters lean heavily on the Easy emotion in this section. . Now that you have learned this part of the offer, you&rsquo;ll see it too! . As you start to binge great copy on your own, it will only couple examples for you to instantly recognize creative ways writers make their offer section seem unique and exciting&hellip; . Then you&rsquo;ll be able to write your own with ease. . The Money Zone promo did a terrific job at this: . . Pump in Some Cred . There is no specific spot to drop this&hellip; . But now is a good time to remind the reader of the guru&rsquo;s credibility before moving onto bonuses. . Something like a quick look at the track record or appearances on TV will do. . Not testimonials, though. . Weave testimonials in between bonuses or save them for after. . The Money Zone does this right before they go into bonuses: . . Add Bonuses . At this point the reader knows what they are getting and how it will work. . And right after that, many great copywriters &ldquo;spice up&rdquo; their offer with some cool bonuses. . Bonuses can be anything, really. . Consider bonuses as cherries on top of your big opportunity. . Let&rsquo;s consider my make-believe government contracts example... . We are offering a big free report for the opportunity. . The report reveals the stock of a computer chip manufacturer that will profit huge from a secret government contract. . This will give investors a ton of money overnight. . So I could offer a bonus report about another profitable investing sector where the government has big, profitable contracts. . Or I could offer a bonus report about other investing sectors that will benefit from the computer chips themselves. . Or I could send them some sort of physical product&hellip; . Like a free laptop that contains the very computer chip the company makes! . Generally, you should make your bonuses related to your big opportunity. . In my personal opinion, tacking on random unrelated bonuses subtracts from the strength of your original offer. . You wouldn&rsquo;t want to tack a &ldquo;how to buy gold&rdquo; bonus at the end of your cryptocurrency letter. . (These two are basically at polar opposite ends of the investing ideology pole) . That&rsquo;s probably the only rule I would put on bonuses. . You might think, &ldquo;Why would anybody do that?&rdquo; . The quick answer is: because it&rsquo;s easy. . Sometimes people have leftover bonuses or free software they can bundle and throw in with their offer. . So they just bundle a bunch of random stuff and throw it at the reader. . Again, to me, that just cheapens your original pitch. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s my two cents. . Just try to get creative when you can. &nbsp;There is a lack of creativity in this world. . Keep your eyes peeled for creative bonuses while you&rsquo;re binging copy. . In Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass, we tried to include bonuses that went along with our theme of safe, predictable income. . We offered a bonus report called - &ldquo;The Recession Proof Portfolio: Five Assets That NEVER Go Out of Style.&rdquo; . . Testimonials . The key for good testimonials, is to try and mimic the reader as much as possible in their presentation. . That includes mirroring your target market&rsquo;s physical features in images, and their economic and life status where you can. . Even locations where you know your target market might be concentrated. . A quick and easy way to mimic your reader is by using photos, even stock photos will do, of people who should resemble your ideal reader. . If you are writing mostly for old white men, find some images of old white men to plug in beside the testimonials. . If you are writing for young female yoga enthusiasts, find some images of young ladies performing yoga. . For all graphics, if you didn&rsquo;t PAY for them - make sure to only use royalty free images and/or images labeled for commercial use. . Basically, don&rsquo;t grab random images off Google. . That&rsquo;s an easy way to get in trouble. . The best testimonials include the most specifics. . Example 1: &ldquo;This service is great!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a pretty cool testimonial. . But let&rsquo;s look at one (made up example) with more specifics&hellip; . Example 2: &ldquo;I had $65 to my name. I spent $49 on Guru A&rsquo;s service. &nbsp;My mom, who I was living with, thought I was crazy. &nbsp;I memorized everything in Guru A&rsquo;s book and employed every step in chapters 2-4, verbatim. Two weeks later I was a millionaire. &nbsp;Thank god for Guru A. They changed my life.&rdquo; . The more details in the testimonial, the greater chance for the Big 4 to be weaved into them. . From this example above we can see that the opportunity to follow Guru A is Big, Fast, Easy, Safe, and Anybody could do it. . So if you have testimonials, look at the long ones. . Here&rsquo;s a great testimonial we used in Rich Dad&rsquo;s Retirement Masterclass: . . Gathering Testimonials . If you don&rsquo;t have a list of testimonials ready to go, that&rsquo;s okay too. . First, think of the perfect story you&rsquo;d want to hear in your testimonial, then ask 3-5 open-ended questions that guide your reader to tell that story. . If you want them to say something like: . &ldquo;I made a ton of money thanks to Guru A in just a couple weeks! I invested in stock xyz as soon as they said to and boom! I made $6,000! I highly recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service!&rdquo; . That&rsquo;s a stellar testimonial . To get a response like that, you might ask these basic, guided questions: . Did you make a lot of money thanks to Guru A? | How much money and how fast did you do it? | How did you do it? | Would you recommend Guru A&rsquo;s service? | . Remember, Safe is our big emotion with testimonials&hellip; . So the more specifics you include, the more you talk about how the reader followed the guru&rsquo;s instructions and won, the more real and safe the testimonial will feel. . When you are binging copywriting and come to the testimonials section, you can translate the testimonials into useful questions that you can use yourself. . Recap The Offer So Far . The copywriter will have covered a lot of stuff in their offer by this point. . And the testimonials will have answered the reader&rsquo;s most pressing questions about whether this could work for them or not&hellip; . Which will make the reader feel Safe. . So they&rsquo;re excited. . Now it&rsquo;s time to make this deal feel larger than life. . You can do that quickly with a strong recap section. . Generally, a recap will be a rapid fire, bullet driven list. . Before we talk about what to say, let&rsquo;s talk about what you&rsquo;re communicating. . You&rsquo;re communicating that this offer contains an intense amount of value. . It&rsquo;s BIG. . An easy way to execute this is with a price anchor. . Before we get to the price anchor, let&rsquo;s look at some recap sections&hellip; . Here&rsquo;s how we did it for a front end product: The Hottest IPO. . Notice how we bullet out each piece of our offer and tease a little bit of information&hellip; . . Also take note of how we total up the values at the end and stack images to make the offer seem BIG! . Now take a look at this recap section from The Money Zone, which is a more expensive back end product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . For the Money Zone sales letter, no price for the product is ever stated in the letter &ndash; so they don&rsquo;t tie values to pieces of the offer on the sales page. . Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about a couple ways to set a price anchor. . The Price Anchor . The price anchor is just the psychological starting point for how much an offer is &ldquo;really worth.&rdquo; . Like a negotiation, the higher you can drive this number up at the start, the better. . This is really easy to do in a bullet driven recap like we did in The Hottest IPO&hellip; . Cover all the things that come standard with the offer. . Give each piece its own bullet with a little bit of detail added. . In as few words as possible, explain what they can expect and how simple it all is&hellip; . Cover all the bonuses offered, and tease some of the information inside. . And here&rsquo;s the little trick: Beside each bullet, assign a value. . &ldquo;My exclusive Pre-IPO Prospectus&hellip;: ($199 Value)&rdquo;. . When you reach the end of your bullets, you can sum up all of your stuff and say something like, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an $8,414 value!&rdquo; . That creates what is known as a price anchor. . Then you can say, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t pay anywhere near that today&hellip; . In fact, you won&rsquo;t even pay HALF that. . You can have all this incredible value, $8,414 worth, for just $49.&rdquo; . Which brings me to&hellip; . A word of caution on your price anchor&hellip; . You may have gotten the sense that $8,414 for just $49 is a little bit of&hellip; well, bullshit. . That&rsquo;s over a 99% reduction. . Nobody would ever deliver that much value so cheap. . And that&rsquo;s a common reaction. . Instead of just telling you that earlier, I thought I&rsquo;d show you first&hellip; . There is a rule of thumb for your price anchor. . Try to keep the anchor from going over 20x the actual price. . We broke that rule on The Hottest IPO&hellip; . But it will be a lot easier for the reader to accept that your offer of $421 has been reduced down to $49&hellip; . Than an offer worth $8,414 being reduced all the way down to $49. . Then you can reframe this discount and make it BIG, without being ridiculous. . &ldquo;You can have this $421 value for the low, low rate of $49! . That&rsquo;s over 80% off the total value! And just a mere 13 cents a day&hellip; . A price that anyone could afford!&rdquo; . See how I was able to reframe that a couple different times? . As you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, each of these lessons offers you a new tool to build your copywriting fluency. . Once you speak the language of copy, and you binge it, it will just make sense to do all these things naturally! . Comparing Apples to Oranges . Aside from the recap section, another way to offer a price anchor is by comparing apples to oranges. . Think of it like comparing a McDonalds cheeseburger to a T-bone steak. . Here&rsquo;s a Real Example from The Buyout Millionaires Club promo at Agora Financial: . The only tool that can help you get ahead of big money moves&hellip; our backtests showed that this indicator could have given readers a chance to see gains like the historical examples I&rsquo;ve shown you already&hellip; . Gains like&hellip; . $27,000, $42,333 and even an extraordinary $95,833 in a Matter of DAYS . How much would that be worth to you? Before you answer, consider this&hellip; . When I used to run a hedge fund&hellip; . We used to charge something called the 2-and-20 fee structure&hellip; . Meaning you are charged a 2% management fee&hellip; . Remember how I said the One-Day Bonus Indicator showed it could deliver average returns totaling . $24,829 every 9 days? . That equates to $1,390,424 a year&hellip; . With gains like that&hellip; . Your fees would easily be over $250,000. . | . Before talking about how much a subscription to the newsletter will cost ($2,000)&hellip; . The copywriters first mention a cost of $250,000 for Wall Street fees. . Apples to oranges. . Offer a Guarantee . When you offer a guarantee, you are simply guaranteeing &ldquo;results.&rdquo; . And a guarantee does not mean you must give someone their money back. . A guarantee can offer anything. . Usually, for cheaper front end offers, a money-back guarantee is appropriate. . But for very expensive back end offers, where information is the product, a money back guarantee can spell disaster. . Because people can buy, download the content, then refund. . But, like I said, you can offer a guarantee without offering someone their money back. . For a financial copywriting back end, you may see a guarantee like this: . &ldquo;We guarantee the chance to see 10x your money or we&rsquo;ll work for free.&rdquo; . Also of note: these words don&rsquo;t guarantee you &ldquo;will&rdquo; make 10x&hellip; . They guarantee you the &ldquo;chance to see 10x your money.&rdquo; . This way if the reader never invests a dime, but the guru still does his job of selecting 10x stocks, then the guru doesn&rsquo;t owe the reader anything further. . Whether the readers invest in the guru&rsquo;s recommendations or not is their choice. . Next, let&rsquo;s look at the words: &ldquo;work for free.&rdquo; . Generally, the guarantee is backed by a second year of the service for free. . Meaning, if the service doesn&rsquo;t produce 10x returns in the portfolio, the second year of the service is free. . The first reaction everyone ALWAYS has to this guarantee is: &ldquo;Why would I want a free service that didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; . That question is tremendously valid&hellip; &nbsp;but apparently inconsequential. . Because financial publishers have been running promos with that guarantee for a long, long time with great success&hellip; so&hellip; there&rsquo;s that. . Here&rsquo;s our guarantee for The 70 Cent Crypto: . . Limit the Spots or Quantity (Scarcity) . I wrote this entire book and when I reached this point, I admit, I had a mini panic attack. . Because I thought I might have completely overlooked a critical fifth pillar to copywriting. . And I imagined I would look like a total fool with egg all over my face&hellip; . Even after saying again and again, &ldquo;All you need is these FOUR things.&rdquo; That potential &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; pillar&hellip; . Urgency&hellip; and its alter ego Scarcity. . Urgency/Scarcity &ndash; The FIFTH Pillar of Copywriting? . Oh my GOD! THERE&rsquo;S A FIFTH PILLAR NOW!? . Well, luckily, no. . While it is very powerful, I don&rsquo;t think I would label urgency as fundamental as The Big 4. . You see, when you are reading copy, I encourage you to perform active reading&hellip; . And dissect every line and try to understand which of The Big 4 the writer was trying to communicate. . Because if you can decode copywriting through active reading, you can binge. . And if you binge you&rsquo;ll recognize the patterns for how master copywriters communicate The Big 4. . Then you will be able to automatically recreate those patterns and communicate exactly what you want with ease. . And when looking at urgency, it doesn&rsquo;t fit the bill to join The Big 4. . Consider The Big 4 as a healthy, well-balanced, four-course meal&hellip; . And urgency is like hot sauce. . You splash it in on top. . Without The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll go hungry. . And without urgency, the meal just isn&rsquo;t as spicy. . Even with huge portions of just two or three of The Big 4, you&rsquo;ll survive. . Let&rsquo;s look at the reverse&hellip; . Think how hard a meal of just hot sauce would be to swallow. . That&rsquo;s your reader&rsquo;s relationship with urgency. . Little doses of urgency here and there go a long way. . Except in the &nbsp;offer section. . The offer section without urgency would be like a dry chicken wing without any sauce. . Follow me? . Okay, so I think you get it now. . Just remember that urgency is some date or deadline. . Some reason to act NOW. . (And as such, I think it is probably best categorized under &ldquo;Big&rdquo; instead of given its own pillar)&hellip; . Urgency&rsquo;s Alter Ego is Scarcity . Even though Urgency can&rsquo;t join The Big 4, it does have an alter-ego. . Urgency&rsquo;s alter ego is Scarcity. . While a deadline limits the time&hellip; . Scarcity takes another step and further limits the opportunity&rsquo;s QUANTITY. . Urgency says &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip;&rdquo; . But Scarcity says, &ldquo;get in by this date&hellip; if you still can.&rdquo; . It signals to the reader&hellip; Maybe there will still spots available for you. . Maybe not. . Who knows? . Because Scarcity is sort of a one-trick-pony that triggers a sensation of &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; when coupled with Urgency, it is more appropriately filed under New&rsquo;s alter ego, &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; than as its own pillar. . Urgency and Scarcity are very powerful when wielded properly. . And while I think you can use them sparingly to great effect, they have a big role to play in the offer section. . Right before asking for the sale, it&rsquo;s very common to see the copywriter limit the spots available and the window of time to get into them. . The Money Zone does it right after the guarantee: . . Ask for the Sale . I said &ldquo;ask for the sale&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;close&rdquo; on purpose. . Here is a subtle nuance of psychology that most folks don&rsquo;t know about or practice&hellip; . When you close, you want to instruct the reader on what to do&hellip; . But you don&rsquo;t want to TELL them what to do. . And therein lies the nuance. . Instead, you present what is called a &ldquo;Crossroads Close.&rdquo; . Crossroads Close . The crossroads close positions the reader at a crossroads where he must choose a path. . The crossroads close will usually go like this&hellip; . &ldquo;You now have two choices. . You can choose to join me and make all this money / experience all these incredible benefits&hellip; . And have yourself a brand new, incredible life. . Or you can click away and go back to the life you&rsquo;ve had before reading this. . The life you&rsquo;ve always had.&rdquo; When phrased like that, it sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice. . Some folks offer a third choice, &ldquo;try to figure all this stuff out on your own, with no help&hellip; Even though it took me 10 years to figure it out and I&rsquo;m a professional.&rdquo; . But based on everything I&rsquo;ve seen in psychology papers, it is my opinion that the fewer choices, the better. . Why water down the contrast of the two original choices? . Anyways, when the reader looks at the original two choices it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice at all. . But it still is a choice. . That&rsquo;s the subtlety of it. . The reader is given the OPTION to be a stubborn ox and say &ldquo;no&hellip;&rdquo; . Even though it makes no logical sense to do so in the context of a crossroad close. . But a choice is all the reader wants. . Choice = autonomy. . The reader is still the master of their own destiny. . They know that even if they choose themselves into a pit of despair, they did it their way. . Look, nobody likes to be preached at... . Nobody likes to be told they must do something or buy something or else they are an idiot&hellip; . Even though many salesmen take the: &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to be an idiot to say no to this. . Don&rsquo;t even think about saying no, you dummy,&rdquo; approach. . At the end of the offer section the reader knows they are being sold&hellip; . Or they should know by now. . They know the Urgency and Scarcity is meant to push them. . And they want the freedom of autonomy. . The freedom to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; . So what does that look like in copy? Here&rsquo;s how The Money Zone did it: . . You&rsquo;ll see the writer present the crossroads close. . Then tell the reader the decision is totally theirs. . Of course while reinforcing how obvious the choice is. . Then at this point, the copywriter has done all he can do. . The copywriter will quickly sum up the opportunity, the urgency, the scarcity&hellip; . And then leave the reader to their final decision to click or not click. . The pitch is over. . Just the big, colorful button remains. . The P.S. and FAQ . Personally, I love to summarize the promo in a P.S. . directly after the sign off. . Sort of like its own abbreviated version of the lead. . Some copywriters like to drop an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) after the sign off. . The FAQ basically pulls out each individual objection, or the most common ones, and addresses them directly. . I&rsquo;m not a fan of FAQs. . For one, it&rsquo;s more work on the copywriter to re-answer questions that should have already been addressed in the copy. . Second, there is no flow or conversation control when it comes to an FAQ. . The way FAQs are written, question by question&hellip; . Allows the reader to freely jump around the page and scan from one question to the next. . In phone sales they say you need to control the conversation. . An FAQ takes that control away from the copywriter: the seller, who should control the conversation. . There is a natural and even forced breakage of attention from one idea to the next in an FAQ section. . And the inevitable repeating of information the reader has &ldquo;already seen before.&rdquo; . What&rsquo;s the point of writing a coherent, story-driven, sales letter that &ldquo;shows&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tells&hellip;&rdquo; Just to make a list that tells after it&rsquo;s all over? . Sure, the copywriter can weave sales messages into FAQ&hellip; . And I know of very successful sales letters with immense FAQ sections (Jim Rickards&rsquo; IMPACT System jumps into mind)&hellip; . But personally, I&rsquo;m not a fan. . Just write compelling copy and the FAQ becomes unnecessary. . You are free to write one if you want&hellip; . Completely your choice. . Wrapping Up The Offer Section . The offer section is chock full of important information. . I hope you noticed from the examples I&rsquo;ve presented&hellip; . And the lessons I&rsquo;ve established early and often in this guide&hellip; . That you must remember to keep The Big 4 top of mind in everything you write. . Even though it might seem like your reader &ldquo;just wants the information&hellip;&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get caught in that trap. . Especially when you&rsquo;re this close to the end. . Even though I have offered some form of structure for your offer section, keep the elements within unique. . Remember, categorization = DEATH. . &ldquo;New and novel&rdquo; is not just for your headline. . It&rsquo;s not just for your lead. . It applies to your body copy, and even your offer copy. . Conclusion . You now have the fundamentals to dissect and translate virtually any piece of copywriting or sales material you come across. . You might be looking at shorter copywriting&hellip; . Facebook ads&hellip; . Or emails&hellip; . Or you may be observing a live webinar that you can&rsquo;t read&hellip; . But these lessons should jump out at you anywhere anything is being sold. . The world should not look the same to you from here on. . Finishing this guide and finally closing it should feel like an awakening. . You can now &ldquo;see the matrix.&rdquo; . If the world doesn&rsquo;t look a little different, this guide did a poor job or you didn&rsquo;t need it. . You now understand that copywriting is not a &ldquo;how to&hellip;&rdquo; . It is a language, purely communicated through subtext. . The words do not matter, so much as what is subliminally communicated. . You know: . It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you communicate. . You know The Big 4 Emotions that must be communicated to stir your reader to action. | You know what to look for in a good headline&hellip; | You know about the 4&rsquo;Us. | You know the purpose and common elements of a lead&hellip; | You know how to structure your body copy. | You know the objection, claim, proof, benefit template. | You know what information must be conveyed in an offer... | . But to always remember to keep The Big 4 top of mind. . &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re telling, you aren&rsquo;t selling.&rdquo; . I thank you from the bottom of my heart if you&rsquo;ve read all the way to this line. . I wanted to create a guide that would help beginners get started on the right foot&hellip; . Offer veterans a fresh perspective on their craft&hellip; . And hopefully create a unique message and methodology to a craft that has been thoroughly covered and studied for generations. . I hope you got something out of this guide... . &nbsp; I&rsquo;m doing that thing where I ramble at the end&hellip; . Thanks so much for reading. . That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. .
