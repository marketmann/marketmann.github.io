                        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
                        <p>I want to send you a free gun. (It is identical in CAD-imaged specs to the standard military-issue &ldquo;Red style&rdquo; training gun.</p>
                        <p>There are 2 things I want you to do when you receive it:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I want you to set the gun aside, and watch the four videos I will also send.</li>
                            <li>Then I want you to give the gun to the toughest, biggest and most coordinated friend you have&hellip; and ask him to:</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Point the Gun At You And Squeeze The Trigger!</h3>
                        <p>It is important that you choose someone who is larger than you. Preferably, he should also have some skill at fighting. <em>A black belt karate master would be perfect.</em></p>
                        <p>Why am I asking you to do this? Because I want to <strong>prove </strong>to you that what you see on these video tapes will allow you to instantly take that gun away (bare-handed) and <em>put him down on the ground</em> before he can move a muscle to squeeze the trigger! And once down, you will be able to <strong>keep</strong> him on the floor (and even slap him silly, if you please). You&rsquo;ll be in complete control.</p>
                        <p>As you will see in these tapes, you do not need strength, or special agility, or even previous skill in fighting. You will see how even a small man (5&rsquo;5&rdquo;, 140 pounds soaking wet) can easily disarm and take down a bodybuilder (6&rsquo; 2&rdquo;, 240 pounds trained in judo!</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s an astonishing fact to learn, but it is true nevertheless. What you are about to learn are the <strong>identical</strong> &ldquo;Disarm and Disable&rdquo; tactics used by elite U.S. military personnel, big city SWAT teams, and high-profile security enforcement&hellip;</p>
                        <h3>Which Have Been Kept Secret From Civilians (Like You) For Almost 20 Years!</h3>
                        <p>Now, let me tell you about this gun. It is a detailed and exact replica of the &ldquo;Red style&rdquo; guns used by the military for training. It was designed by an American craftsman (who is now working with the military) and is hand casted, so that <em>all the tolerances are identical</em>. It has the feel, heft, and balance of an authentic high-powered automatic pistol, yet is crafted from special solid polymers so it can be used for real-life training.</p>
                        <p>This gun would foola an expert who picked it up blindfolded &mdash; <em>only </em>the solid bore and the color (white) give it away as a training weapon. (The color is used for two reasons: To avoid misunderstandings with people who do not realize it is a training gun, and to keep <em>you</em> from accidentally picking up a real gun to practice with.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-column grid-flex-column-container grid-first-col-2">
                        <p>There is one important alteration to this training gun.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>trigger-guard</strong> has been strategically changed so it will not snap the finger off your training partner, as a normal trigger guard would. (Your big, tough friend wouldn&rsquo;t like that&hellip; though he couldn&rsquo;t do much about it until you shared your tapes with him.) This alteration allows you to train without &ldquo;pulling punches&rdquo;, and speeds up your learning curve dramatically.</p>
                        <p><em>Now,</em> don&rsquo;t get the idea the &ldquo;moves&rdquo; you are about to learn are difficult, just because they have been held in secret by some of the most feared fighters in the world. <em>The moves are simple and natural&hellip;</em> yet utterly devastating when used against an armed attacker.

                            Walk Your Streets In Fear!</h3>
                        <p>Are you having trouble believing all this? That's okay &mdash; I'm used to people being suspi&shy;cious... <em>at first. </em>But the truth is, what you are about to learn is praised by professional soldiers, and law enforcement personnel all over the country. I have included "testimonials" with this letter from U.S. military generals, big-city police veterans and even the publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine (who almost never gives endorsements). They <em>all</em> agree that this new system can be learned quickly and easily, and will work on the street under even the worst conditions imaginable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-column grid-flex-column-container grid-second-col-3">
                        <p><strong>Here is how we came to discover these "professional warrior" bare-handed fighting secrets: </strong>For a long time now, I have been con&shy;nected to the "inside" of certain elite military and law enforcement circles. (Including the Navy <strong>SEALS</strong> &mdash; the most dangerous soldiers on the planet.) My goal is to help civilians like you to understand the super-effective fighting skills that have been developed. I want my family to feel as safe and protected as possible, and I'm sure you want the same for your loved ones.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, through certain inside "contacts" (which I am<strong> not </strong>going to tell you about) I was approached by two of the most respected professional combat trainers in the world: <strong>Randy Wanner </strong>is a feared martial arts expert who for years has been training federal and state law enforcement agencies in "street survival fighting tactics". (He was also the former Martial Arts editor for Soldier of Fortune magazine.) His name is well-known among the elite "warriors" of modern-day combat, and he has gone toe-to-&shy;toe with street fighters from all over the world to prove his techniques are superior to anything else out there.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bob Taylor </strong>(who spent 2 tours in Viet Nam with the 101'st Airborne, MACV-SERT and the famous 75th Rangers) is considered one of the country's most experienced experts in counter insurgency operations; state, local and federal law enforcement agencies use him frequently for training. He is also a specialist in counter&shy;terrorism for African, South American and Cen&shy;tral American governments.</p>
                        <p>These two guys are in demand all over the world. Their clients include the <strong>U.S. military, </strong>big-city <strong>SWAT </strong>teams, international anti-terrorist squads and top security firms in 15 foreign countries. These clients hire Bob and Randy for just one thing:</p>
                        <h3>Their Incredible Skill In Quickly<br />
                            Teaching Their Unique "Bare-<br />
                            Handed" Disarming and Disabling <br />
                            Techniques For Armed Attackers!</h3>
                        <p>This new fighting system took over 20 years to develop. It was necessary because the techniques the police and the military used to use &mdash; based on centuries-old karate moves &mdash;simply were <strong>not effective </strong>in real combat conditions. Soldiers and officers who were supposed to be disarming their attackers were, instead, <em>getting shot and disabled themselves!</em></p>
                        <p>Randy and Bob decided to find out what was wrong. There was only one sane way to do this. They used their connections within the military establishment to get "training" bullets for their weapons. These bullets (called "Red Jets") are almost impossible for civilians to get. They are made of wax and polymer, yet are calibrated to fire from real weapons and can blow a hole in quarter-inch plywood from 15 feet. These training bullets were necessary for Bob and Randy's research, because..</p>
                        <h3>They Used This Live Ammunition On Each Other To Develop <br />
                            Their New Disarming System!</h3>
                        <p>Let me tell you &mdash; it takes some kind of guts to face a gun loaded with live ammo. Those wax bullets travel at <em>over 400 feet per second... even if they don't tear up your body like real bullets, these guys have the scars to prove getting hit with them isn't pretty.</em></p>

                    <div class="grid-column grid-flex-column-container grid-third-col-1">
                        <p>(I personally saw Bob shred Randy's left earlobe during a demon&shy;stration of the "wrong" way to clear a gun! There was blood everywhere during the rest of the demo.) <em>No one else in the world has ever done this kind of live-weapon research!</em></p>
                        <p>The first thing they found out, of course, was that 99% of the disarming tactics being used by soldiers and cops (and still being taught by smug karate masters who have never had to face a loaded gun in person) <strong>DO NOT WORK!</strong></p>
                        <p>This has to stop. It's irresponsible. It's stupid &mdash; especially when Randy and Bob have, after 20 years of tough research, come up with simple and easy-to-learn ways that <strong>do </strong>work!</p>
                        <p>Their discoveries have revolutionized the way modern professional warriors approach armed attackers &mdash; already, there are cops who are on record saying these new skills have saved their lives in the street!</p>
                        <p><strong>Why do you &mdash; as a civilian &mdash; need these skills? </strong>Are you kidding? The whole world has gone psycho. The odds that you will be faced by an armed attacker &mdash; without a weapon of your own to rely on &mdash; are getting worse every day. This kind of advanced knowledge (even if it is easy to learn) isn't a luxury for American men anymore. The facts are staggering:</p>
                        <div class="list-item"><strong>I.T. </strong>(the famous university) did a study uncovering the fact that <strong>5 of every 6 twelve-year-old kids are going to be the victim of a violent crime in their lives! </strong>That's almost <em>everybody, </em>sooner or later! (Most kids&mdash;and most adults, too &mdash; simply do not have a <em>clue </em>how to defend themselves in a tight spot. When you show a lack of confidence in yourself, you become the most attractive target for criminals there is!)</div>
                        <div class="list-item">Jean O'Neil (of the <strong>National Crime Pre&shy;vention Council) </strong>says that victims who are forced into an attacker's car <em>rarely </em>walk away alive! (Yet <em>most </em>people cannot mount even a feeble defense against someone forcing them through the door!)</div>
                        <div class="list-item">And every kind of horrible crime is becoming more and more common&mdash;you are no longer safe in your home, in your car, in a restaurant, or on the street surrounded by other people! (Jerks with nothing to lose are now senselessly shooting their robbery victims even <strong>after </strong>they've gotten everything of value.)</div>
                        <p class="extra-top">What's more, new studies show that women who <em>fight back </em>are less likely to be raped. And that learning some form of self-defense is your <em>best bet </em>against a criminal population who is prepared to use force and violence on a whim. <strong>But there's a BIG problem here. </strong>The way most Americans are going about getting prepared to defend themselves is simply...</p>
                        <h3>Not Going To Work!</h3>
                        <p>Here are the facts, my friend: Most martial art studios are run by people who have <em>never been in a real fight before in their lives... </em>and you will probably be trained (in a <em>huge </em>class) by people who have been prematurely promoted to "black belt" just to handle the classes! These "storefront" studios operate exactly like health spas &mdash; they lure in large numbers of people, and get the money up front. It's a business.</p>
                        <p>And the garbage being sold to <strong>women </strong>offers only the pale illusion of self-defense:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-column grid-flex-column-container grid-third-col-2">
                        <p class="no-indent"> Tear gas <strong>will not work </strong>on a drug-crazed attacker intent on harm. You saw what police "stun guns" did to Rodney King on that famous video: Nothing. Most rape-prevention seminars ignore the most common aspect of rape: The woman is thrown to the ground <em>first, </em>and then attacked. She will seldom get an opportunity to try the fancy knee-to-the-groin trick the seminars teach &mdash; a move which, by the way, is usually taught <em>completely wrong! </em>(You may think a "ball kick" is easy, but it's actually a <em>low-percentage </em>kick, and hard to pull off. There are several better and more <em>devastating </em>things to do, as Bob and Randy will soon show you.)</p>
                        <p>Even the fancy alarms and sirens people are "arming" themselves with are worthless in most cases of attack. (They don't protect cars, they don't protect houses, and they won't "protect" you either.)</p>
                        <p><strong>In reality, you have only two choices: </strong>Remain a vulnerable "potential victim" who trusts that God will protect you... or learn the RIGHT way to defend yourself.</p>
                        <p>It's not hard to do. In fact, it's relatively <em>simple...</em></p>
                        <h3>Once You Understand <br />
                            The "Inside" Secrets!</h3>
                        <p>One of Bob's favorite hobbies is to attend the big conventions of gun enthusiasts. He will challenge 20 of them to line up with their favorite weapon (unloaded, of course) and, one by one, demonstrate how he could take the gun away from them before they could pull the trigger. And then he would <strong>do </strong>it, bop, bop, bop, all the way down the line, never using the same move twice, never breaking a sweat, and never using any but the most <em>simple </em>skills.</p>
                        <p>Sounds like something you might want to learn for yourself, doesn't it?</p>
                        <p>Well, there's a "hitch". You see, the only way to even get any personal training from Bob or Randy was to get into their heavily-monitored seminars. But to get in, you need <em>2 forms of official credentials and licenses </em>(plus about <strong>$850 </strong>for the full board of instruction). Only professionals &mdash; elite soldiers, police <strong>SWAT </strong>teams, high-profile security agents &mdash; have been allowed to learn this life-saving stuff...</p>
                        <h3>Until Now!</h3>
                        <p>Why now? Because, after about a year of intense negotiation, we convinced Bob and Randy to go into a video studio and &mdash; taking as long as they needed &mdash; produce the <strong>first video package ever </strong>of their most trustworthy techniques for facing an armed attacker bare-handed. And they did just that. After weeks of filming and editing, they created the only package in existence for people (like you) outside the world of professional warriors. <strong>Yet they pulled no punches in presenting their new fighting system! </strong>What you get here is all their best techniques, best advice, and best training methods!</p>
                        <p><strong>Here's what you get in this amazing, just-released video package:</strong></p>
                        <div class="list-item"><strong>4 full-length videos </strong>(almost 5 solid hours) &mdash; teaching you all the advanced combat techniques for instantly disarming and disabling (bare-handed) any assailant coming at you with a gun, club or knife (the most common weapons you&rsquo;ll see on American streets!)</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-column grid-flex-column-container grid-third-col-3">
                        <div class="list-item">Included is the famous "Dirty Tricks" video of Bob and Randy's favorite moves&mdash; really sneaky ways to manipulate and "put down" any attacker before he knows what .. and keep him down until help arrives or you decide an "alternative" course of action! Even trained street fighters <em>twice your size </em>will go down fast &mdash; and <em>stay </em>down &mdash; with these astonishing fighting secrets!</div>
                        <div class="list-item"><em>Plus, </em>you get your specially-made <strong>"replica" gun... </strong>yours FREE just for ordering the video tapes.</div>
                        <p>The techniques you will discover on these tapes are the <em>identical </em>ones taught to elite soldiers,<strong>&nbsp;SWAT </strong>team cops and high-security personnel...</p>
                        <h3>With One Important Difference!</h3>
                        <p>In these videos, you get the incredible advantage of seeing everything via <strong>3 separate cameras </strong>(mounted stage left, right, and overhead)... so you get <em>multi-angles </em>and <em>slow-motion repetitions </em>of each and every move! This means you get an increased understanding... and you'll follow a faster "learning curve" than even the professionals get during a seminar!</p>
                        <div class="pg3-box border-color-opposite border-width1 border-solid"><em>"...after about a year of intense negotiation, we convinced Bob and Randy to go into a video studio and... produce the <strong>first video package ever </strong>of their most trustworthy techniques for facing an armed attacker bare-handed."</em></div>
                        <p>This is no Hollywood B.S.... these are real techniques used by cops and soldiers! <strong>And make no mistake &mdash; </strong>this stuff should <em>only </em>be used when you are faced with what the professionals call <strong>"Condition Red": </strong>The point where you have <strong>absolutely </strong>decided that your assailant has already made the choice to harm you.. <em>and you must act to save your life!</em></p>
                        <p>That's what this tape package is all about. You, ultimately, have to take responsibility for yourself, and for your actions. We can't do that for you. Neither can we guarantee that what you learn here will make you invulnerable to harm &mdash; that would be a stupid claim, and you would be a fool to believe it. No, what you have here is an OPTION. You are giving yourself one more (powerful) choice in this crazed, dangerous world&mdash; the choice to not be a vulnerable victim who has no idea what to do... even though you know that certain harm is imminent!</p>
                        <p>I don't rob people. I don't like to hurt anyone, and I don't like to see other people get hurt. It sickens me that the criminal element has taken over our streets, and is invading homes with impunity. That <em>sucks </em>&mdash;and I, for one, am damned glad to have tools like these to <em>take back </em>my little piece of the world.</p>
                        <p>And I believe you feel the same way.</p>
