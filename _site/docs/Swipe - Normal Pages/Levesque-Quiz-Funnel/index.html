      </h2>

            <div class="bio__info">
                <div class="bio__text">
                    <p>The year was 2008, and I was working for AIG in China when the recession hit and I quit my job to
                        start my own business. I was <strong>terrified,</strong> but I knew I HAD to do it.</p>
                    <p>I grew up working class (my mom cut hair for a living), and after studying neuroscience at Brown
                        and then working on Wall Street... I <strong>thought</strong> I wanted a corporate life with a
                        nice salary and benefits. But something was missing. The dream of starting my own business just
                        wouldnât let go...until I finally decided to make the leap.</p>
                    <p>Iâm telling you this because if youâve been putting this off, thereâs <strong>no better time to
                            start</strong> (or grow) a business from your home working remotely, selling and marketing
                        digitally. I struggled at first to grow my business, until I experimented with a new type of
                        funnel (what would later become called a QUIZ Funnel) to ASK my market what they wanted and then
                        GIVE it to them...</p>

                        <p class="funnels__p">So I started building QUIZ Funnels for other companies, and before I knew
                            it clients were paying anywhere from $15,000-$50,000 up front, PLUS $5,000/month retainer,
                            PLUS a 5% royalty payment on gross sales.</p>
                        <p class="funnels__p">Royalty payments were anywhere from a few thousands dollars a month to
                            upwards of $60,000/month for a single funnel. This was royalty passive income that I was
                            generating on the back of the QUIZ Funnels I was building in market after market. </p>

                        <p>This is the first time I've ever delivered this training in an online setting. Until now, the
                            only way to get access to this information was to spend $5,000 fly to our headquarters in
                            Austin, Texas, and be part of one of our live in person QUIZ Funnel trainings.</p>
                        <p>But with everything happening in the world right now, I have no idea when that next training
                            is going to happen or if we're ever going to offer that in person training again.</p>
                        <p>Now, because I've never delivered this training in an online environment before, this
                            training is going to be taught live and the course kicks off on June 29th.</p>
                        <p>Everything is being recorded if you canât attend a session and if you want to go back and
                            re-watch anything that we cover.</p>
                        <p>Weâre also doing weekly Q&A calls, Live Funnel Reviews & Tear Downs</p>
                        <p>Plus you also get access to downloadable templates, and checklists, resources and examples.
                        </p>
                        <p>Everything is accessed through our custom online LMS, which you can access from any device,

                        <p>2 Reasons:</p>
                        <p>Reason #1: We want to showcase the power of BUCKET 2.0 and get FAST RESULTS...and the best
                            way to create all kinds of QUIZ Funnel examples in all different markets is to get my
                            absolute best training in your hands and have my team build your quiz for you...</p>
                        <p>Reason #2: Even though we are LOSING money up front on this crazy steal of a deal, the reason
                            Iâm willing to do this is because I know from experience, when our users have a quiz thatâs
                            working for their business...they remain a customer for life...</p>
                        <p>I know that if I do everything in my power to get your quiz BUILT and getting results...You
                            are going to remain a Bucket user for life because itâs paying for itself MANY times over.
